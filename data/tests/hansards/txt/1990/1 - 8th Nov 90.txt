<HEADER>H A N S A R D</HEADER>Thursday, 1st November, 1990THE HOUSE MET AT THIRTY MINUTES PAST TWO O'CLOCK[Mr. Deputy Speaker in the Chair]PRAYERS<HEADER>ANSWERS TO ORAL QUESTIONS</HEADER>Question No. 489Payment of Compensation to Mr. TachoMR. F.O. GODANA asked the Minister of State, Office of .the President, why Mr. Kule Tacho, a former Administration Policeman, PF/No. 180071, not been compensated for non-fatal injuries he sustained in an accident in the course of his duties in 1963.<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Kamuren): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Mr. KuleTacho, has not been compensated because the Director of Medical Services has not filed his recommendations on that case. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. F.O. GODANA: This is an injury that was sustained about 28 years ago and has since been pending. Last year when I asked the same Question in this House, the Assistant Minister undertook to contact the Director of Medical Services so at to Covance a Medical Board. Could he explain to the House why this promise was not fulfilled? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KAMUREN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, to the satisfaction of the hon. Member, may I give the following information.Mr.Tacho was assessed by the Medical Board in 1964 and he was awarded a nil per cent in capacity. He appealed for a second assessment and the Medical Board was convened in 1967 and assessed him. The report of the second Board meeting was not accepted because it was not properly constituted as per legalMR. KAMUREN (CTD.)requirements; it lacked the presence of three Medical Practitioners and the Chairman. Mr. Tacho, went ahead and made a further appeal in the same year. The Medical Board was convened, on his beheld, and assessed him nil per cent incapacity again.In 1988, Mr. Tacho, complained to the Director of Medical Services and requested another assessment. The Director instructed the Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) to convene yet, another Medical Board to assist Mr. Tacho. KNH, wrote to Mr.Tacho, Ref. KNH/MPD/203/V " dated 3rd April, 1990, asking him to appear before another Medical Board on 24th April, 1990 through the contact address which he had used in his complaint letter to the Director of Medical Services. The Board met, but Mr. Tacho, failed to turn up.The same Question appeared in Parliament on 20th April, 1989, as Parliamentary Question No. 78, that is the same Question. Nothing can be done until the Director of Medical Services files the report for the second Board Meeting again. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. EKIDOR: Can the Assistant Minister tell the House, what methods are used to assess compensation in a case like that of Mr. Tacho. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KAMUREN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thought it was very clear. It is the DMS, who is supposed to instruct the Chairman of the Board and three practitioners doctors who are so much concerned with the case to meet to assess compensation. They have met twice and made some assessments as indicated in my answer.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as of now, we should wait until another Board Meeting is convened, is that this gentleman can appear and then we see what happens next. </NEWSPEECH>?<NEWSPEECH>MR. ANASWA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, Mr. Tacho, being a Police Officer, has done a good job for this nation. I would like to know from the hon. Assistant Minister, when this meeting is supposed to be convened, so that, he can actually be able to be compensated? 1963 is a long long time this man is suffering. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KAMUREN: In fact, I will liaise with the DMS tomorrow morning to see that he convenes the meeting immediately, so that we get this assessment finalized. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. F.O. GODANA: Mr. Tacho was not in receipt of the letter that has been referred to in the answer by the Assistant Minister. Could he	 ensure that next time when the Board is convened, Mr. Tacho's letter is sent to me so that I can contact him? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KAMUREN: I will do that, Sir. </NEWSPEECH>THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. arap Chepkok's Question.Question No. 506<HEADER>REGISTRATION OF A KENYAN STUDENT IN U.S.S.R. </HEADER>MR. arap CHEPKOK asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Alternation Co-operation, why has his Ministry not registered Mr. Kipruto Chirchir, a Post-Graduate student in Moscow Friendship University, as a Kenyan Student in the U.S.S.R.THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION (Mr. Obure): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.According to the records held in my Ministry Mr. Kipruto Chirchir was scheduled to finish his Under-Graduate studies in Mechanical Engineering with emphasis machine design and construction in July, 1986. I am informed by theTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION (Mr. Obure) (CTD.)Kenya Embassy in Moscow that Mr. Chirchir wrote to the Embassy on 30th September, 1986, to the effect that he successfully completed his Under-Graduate studies as planned, but his departure for home was being delayed by. Corrections which were being done on his result slip and also owing to the illness of his wife who was in hospital at that time. The Embassy has no record, showing that he informed them about his return to the Society Union to pursue Post-Graduate studies, nor does t the Embassy have any record that he could not be registered as a student. There is also no record of the complaint having being lodged against a refusal by the Embassy to register him.May I, take this opportunity, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, to inform my friend, hon. Arap Chepkok, that it is the requirement that the Embassy registers all students in their respective countries. The Embassy in Moscow would have no reason whatsoever to refuse him the desired registration or any other service that is normally provided to Kenyan students. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. Arap CHEPKOK: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, according to a letter wrote by the student states that he went to register at the Embassy in 1981, he was refused to register as a Kenya student in U.S.S.R. He therefore, managed to stay until; 1986 when he graduated Masters defence.I am going to quote the problems which he had faced at that time."The Kenya Embassy in U.S.S.R. refused to register me as a Kenya student in Russia. No payments for my maintenance my file was closed thus I had no status as a Kenyan student. My and salary were stopped‚Äù. MR. Arap CHEKKOK (CTD.)That means, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that there was something wrong. In 1986, when he finished his Masters degree cruise he was still complaining that he had not registered. This is why I am asking the Assistant Minister to tell the House exactly why the man was not registered as a Kenyan student in U.S.S.R in 1981, but not 1986? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OBURE: I am aware that hon. Arap Chepkok will be asking a further question this afternoon relating to the salary and allowances, and therefore, I do not want to deal with that. I want to state once again, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, that it is not true that the Embassy refused to register Mr. Chirchir. As a matter of fact, this particular student, was registered as an Under-Graduate student way back in the academic year 1980/81 and his file number at the Embassy, is file KEM/EDU/SU/1086. There is correspondence between that particular student and our Embassy in Moscow starting from the academic	 year 1980/81 and the last correspondence in that file from this particular student is dated 21st December, 1988. Therefore, I stand here to correct the impression which has been created by the hon. Member the truth of the matter is that the student was registered.I want to go further and say that following the registration of that particular student, he did in fact, receive assistance from the Kenya Embassy. He was in receipt of payment on a regular basis during the academic year 1982/83.He received further payments during 20 nobles and 9 kopecks academic year 1983 </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: What is the equivalent in Kenya shillings of that amount? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR OBURE: I will go further down, if you allow Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, to quote that in Kenya shillings. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Bear that in mind. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OBURE: He received further allowances during the academic year 1983/84 and during 1984/85. He received two payments in the form of allowances. The first payment was equivalent to Ksh.2, 500/= and the second payment was approximately Ksh.560.40. During the 1985/86 academic year an allowance was released to him equivalent to Ksh.5, 000/- but the payment could not be made to him because he had already completed his Under-Graduate studies.Therefore, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, you can see that this particular student was registered and indeed, he was eligible for all the services normally extended to Kenyan students as in this case you have seen that he was being paid allowances. </NEWSPEECH>						<NEWSPEECH>MR. CEEPKOK: If what the Assistant Minister is telling the House is true, can he lay documentary evidence on the Table to show that this student received his allowances through the embassy? As far as I know, Mr. Chirchir has not received any allowance. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OBURE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the problem with hon. Chepkok is that he chooses to believe a young student out there in the U.S.S.R as opposed. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. CEEPKOK: On a point of order, Sir. The person in question is not a young student. He has been a teacher at Lenana High School. He is an old man and not a young man. Can he prove that Mr. Chirchir was paid? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OBURE: I was just about to say that the problem with my hon. Friend is that he chooses to believe what he has been told by one individual out there in Moscow as opposed to what I am telling him in my capacity ELS Assistant Minister in this Government. I would rather plead with my hon. colleague to believe what I am telling him because it is the truth. Payment was made to Mr. Chirchir and if the hon. Member wants us to prove that, he will have to wait for some time so that we can obtain payment vouchers from Moscow. The truth of the matter is that payment has been made to him in his capacity as a registered student in a U.S.S.R. university. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. AKASWA: Hon. Chepkok would like the Assistant Minister to lay on the Table documentary evidence to prove that Mr. Chirchir has been paid his allowances. How can we believe what the Assistant Minister is saying in the absence of any prove? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OBURE: Sir, I believe that the information I am giving this hon. House is correct and the hon. Member should take it as the truth. If the hon. Member wants me to prove what I am saying, then we shall have to call for the relevant vouchers and so on. Kenyan students abroad, are being paid by the Government in various countries and if we are going to ask for evidence for the amount paid to very student, then it would be very cumbersome. I plead with the Chair that I be believed in this particular instance because I am sure this student has received his allowances. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. EKID0R: Sir, it is common knowledge that any money received must be signed for. How can we tell whether somebody did not take advantage of this student and took his money from the embassy? That is why we want to a signed document by Mr. Chirchir indicating that he received the allowance in question. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OBURE: If this particular person had been paid from my Ministry headquarters, I would have carried here copies of relevant vouchers. Unfortunately, he was paid in Moscow and it is not possible to obtain vouchers to support what I have just said. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. CHEPKOK: Sir, Moscow is not heaven that it cannot be reached. Can he tell, us when he is going to Table payment vouchers so that we can believe what he is telling us? How can I believe the information he has been given by his officers? How many times have Ministers presented wrong information given to them by their officers? We, therefore, insist that vouches be Tabled here to convince us that Mr. Chirchir was indeed paid. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OBURE: Sir, I plead once again that I want to be believed. I have never given this House incorrect information </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order Mr. Obure, I find the matter in question fairly straightforward. It would put the matter to rest if you could get in touch with the Kenya Embassy in Moscow and ask them to send you the relevant vouchers. Do you have any difficult with that? I am sure the hon. Member would like to believe what you are saying, but unfortunately, there is that element of doubt to the effect that, perhaps, the officer in Moscow may not want to give you the right information and which you may believe to be true. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OBURE: Sir, I accept that. I undertake to contact our embassy in Moscow and I am sure we will be able to get supporting documents as soon as possible. Meanwhile, hon. Chepkok should know that these allowances only relate to the period when Mr. Kipruto Chirchir was registered as an undergraduate student. When he went back for post-graduate studies, he did not register with the embassy and, therefore, he was not entitled to any allowances. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. Arap CHEPKOK: On a point of order, Sir. The Assistant Minister is misleading the House. Mr. Chirchir went to Moscow for post-graduate studies. He is now studying for his Ph.D and he is still there. The Assistant Minister is continuing to mislead the house that Mr.Chirchir went for under-graduate & studies in Moscow. Mr. Chirchir was a teacher at Lenana High School and was sponsored by the Government for post-graduate studies in Moscow. He had already graduated from the University of Nairobi. What is, therefore, telling the House? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Where is Mr. Chirchir currently? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. CHEPKOK: He is in Moscow, Sir. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY-SPEAKER: Very well. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OBURE: The information I have is that Mr. Chirchir went to in mechanical engineering during the Moscow University to do under-graduate studies 1980/81 academic year. He completed his studies in 1986/87 financial year. He wrote to the embassy saying that he had completed his under-graduate studies and that he was coming home. Therefore, he was deleted from the list of Kenyan students in Moscow. If he went back, then he has not reported his presence to the embassy. I am simply extending a hand of co-operation to my hon. friend to the effect that register if Mr. Chirchir wants any further assistance from our embassy, he should register himself and be entitled to all facilities extended to Kenyan students. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MRS. NDETEI: Sir, I do not want to raise an issue with my hon. friend, Mr. Chepkok, but it looks a little bit amazing if this student went to Moscow in 1981 and that up to now he is still struggling to acquire that one degree after 10 years. It looks like Mr. Chepkok is not clear with what .he is asking. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. CHEPKOK: Do not think that I have never been to school, (laughter)According to the letter I have, Mr. Chirchir was a teacher at Lenana High School after graduating from the University of Nairobi. He went for post-graduate studies on 30th August, 1980. He was awarded M.Sc. degree in 1986. He is now taking a Ph.D course. What is wrong with that? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>HON. MEMBERS: Nothing. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. CHEPKOK: It is wrong for the Assistant Minister to get away with misleading answers. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.OBURE: Sir, I have not misled the House in any way. I am simply informing the hon. Member that Mr. Chirchir was registered as an under-graduate student in mechanical engineering. He may have been at the University of Nairobi doing B.A. Therefore, if he wanted to have a degree in mechanical engineering, he had to start afresh in </NEWSPEECH>								<NEWSPEECH>MR. MISOI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, we have been told that this particularly student went to U.S.S.R in 1980 and completed his studies in 1986 and now he is doing his Phd. degree. The Assistant Minister now says that he should get in touch with the Embassay, but does the Ministry of Education know where this man is? If they do know where he is, they should contact him because he is a Kenyan and cannot be allowed to disappear just like that. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OBURE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the question I was dealing with is that of registration of this student in Lumumba University in Moscow. This is because the hon. Questioner had insisted that this particular student was not registered at the Embassay. However, I have just informed the House that this is not correct because the student was registered at the Embassay. I would like to inform the hon. Member that we know where this student is and that he continued to obtain allowances until 1987 when he wrote to us to say that he was coming back to Kenya. Therefore, as far as our Embassay in Moscow is concerned, the man had come back to Kenya. However, when he decided to go back to Moscow, he did not register himself with the Embassay and it took the Embassay quite some time to know where he was. Finally, the Kenya Embassay in Moscow did find out that this man is at the Lumumba. University and we have written to him asking him to register himself at the Embassay so that the normal facilities extended to other Kenyan students could be extended to him. Are we wrong in doing so? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. A.K. KINYANJUT: Mr. Deputy Speaker, I think the Assistant Minister should apologize to the House for consistently referring to this graduate student as an under graduate. If he had graduated here in Nairobi, he was a graduate, fool stop. We know that this person went to Moscow to undertake post-graduate studies which means that he was a graduate student. So, I do not see any reason why the Assistant Minister should keep on referring to him as an under-graduate since he was a graduate student. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OBURE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it would be appropriate for me at this point to clarify that Mr. Chirchir left Lenana as an SI teacher under graduate. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.CHEPKOK: On a Point of order, Mr.Deputy Speaker, sir, could the Assistant Minister. </NEWSPEECH>		<NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order Mr. Chepkok I have not given you the Floor. We must continue now. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.OBURE: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. In the light of the information that was given by the Assistant Minister for Education, hon. Amayo, would it not be in order for hon. Chepkok to apologize for misleading the House all the time? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. CHEFKOK: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have a letter here with me which was written by Mr. Chirchir himself in which he says that he went to the Lumumbar University as a post-graduate. I do not just come here to say things which I do not know about. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order Mr. Chepkok Can you just put your supplementary question. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. CHEPKOK: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we would like the Assistant Minister to give the proper answer to the house because he does know whether this man is in Moscow nor does know whether he is registered at our Embassay there. Car he give us the proper answer to this/question and if he does not have the answer can he tell us when he is going to bring this information to the house? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Ogur): On a point of information, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Overruled! Overruled! </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.OBURE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, my Ministry is aware that Mr. Kipruto Chirchir is now doing a Ph.D degree is Moscow and all we are asking him is to go to our Kenya Embassay in Moscow and register there. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Kiliku's Question; </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.WASINE-NDOKSI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Could the Assistant Minister tell this House by what means they have requested Mr. Chirchir to report to the Kenyan Embassay in Moscow?, has he confirmed that the student has agreed to follow the proper procedure? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.OBURE: Mr. Deputy Speaker. Sir, I have assumed all along that since this student is in constant correspondence with the hon. Member, he should write to him and tell him to report at our Embassay to register himself. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Could it not perhaps be helpful if the Kenyan Embassay would get in touch with him directly since obviously they have his address instead of asking the hon. Member to do that? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OBURE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would be getting in touch with our Embassay in Moscow in respect of this information and I will ask then to try and trace this particular student. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.DEPUTY SPEAKER: I am sorry, Mr. Obure. I do not seem to get it right. I though you said that this student is at the Lumumba University and that the Kenya Embassay knows this. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OBURE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are aware that this student is at the Lumumba University and we shall therefore contact him and ask him to register himself with our Embassay in Moscow. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Ogur): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, in view of the fact that Mr. Chirchir is studying electrical engineering in Moscow where post graduate studies includes studies of </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order Mr. Ogur! It does clearly appear that you are trying to provoke the Chair. In the first instance, you wanted to offer some information and I overruled you and now you are attempting to ask a question under the guise of a point of order and I cannot allow this. We must move on now. Mr. Kiliku's Question. </NEWSPEECH>Question No.559<HEADER> FIXED ASSETS OF N.S.S.F</HEADER><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: That question has been deferred in view of the fact the hon. Kiliku seems to have gone down to Coast. </NEWSPEECH>(Question deferred)Let us move on to Mr. Kimemia's Question.Question No .515Payment of Retirement Benefits to Mr. King'ori.MR.KIKEMTA asked the Minister for Labour when Mr. Patrick King'ori FM/NO.205 695 418, who retired in December, 1987, will be paid his retirement benefits.<NEWSPEECH>THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: The Minister for Labour is not there? Let us move on to Mr. Chepkok's Question. </NEWSPEECH>Question No.517Payment of Salary and Allowance to Teacher Chirchir.ME. CHEPKOK asked the Minister for Education since Mr. Kipruto Chirchir, a former teacher at Lenana High School, was sponsored by the Ministry for a Post-Graduate Course at Moscow Friendship University, U.S.S.R. in 1980, why the Ministry then terminate the payment of his salary and other maintenance allowances with effect from 1981.<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Amayo): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.As you might have noticed from the Question itself, the subject matter is closely related to Question NO.506 regarding the same gentleman that we have been talking about.Nevertheless, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to say that the Ministry of Education terminated the payment of salary and other allowances to Mr. KiprutoChirchir because he was not entitled to study leave with pay. This was because the course of Machine Engineering which he was pursuing in the U.S.S.R. was not relevant to his career as a Secondary School teacher. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MAKAU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, sir, the Assistant Minister has given us information regarding the other Question. By answering this Question the way it is asked, he is accepting that this person was a post graduate, and yet he said that this was not the case. Which is which between the two sides? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. AMAYO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is the point in which hon. Ogur is very necessary as a former student of Moscow Friendship University. The under-graduate course in‚Äî </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Amayo, are you saying that the Ministry of Education is not competent to answer this Question? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. AMAYO: No, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. All I am saying is that hon. Ogur had just begun to explain that in the Soviet Union, an under-graduate course is inclusive of a maters degree. Mr. Chirchir was teaching in Lenana High School and he left it as an "SI" teacher. When he left for the Soviet Union in 1980, he was going to pursue a six-year course which would entitle him to be awarded a masters degree. You will notice that the Soviet Union hardly awardes bachelor degrees. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. ANASWA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the House has been left completely confused because, according to hon. Chepkok, this person was in the University of Nairobi which was not training "S1""teachers in 1981'but'graduate teachers. Could the Assistant Minister tell us which subjects this teacher was teaching in Lenana High School as an "S1" teacher? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. AMAYO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the point at hand here is that hon. Chepkok said that Mr. Chirchir graduated from the University of Nairobi whereas our records do not show Mr. Chirchir as having graduated from the University of Nairobi. The records we have indicate that Mr. Chirchir was an "S1" teacher who got a scholarship to study in the Soviet Union. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. MIS0I: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are getting confused. Hon. Chepkok says that this man was a graduate and the Assistant Minister says that he was an "S1" teacher. We agree that he was teaching in Lenana High School. Could we be told exactly who this person really is? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. AMAYO: Mr. Deputy "Speaker, Sir, I am able to produce documentsMR. AMAYO (CTD.)next Tuesday to prove that Mr. Chirchir was in Lenana as an "S1" teacher. I hope that on the same day, hon. Cheepkok will also produce documents to prove that Mr. Chirchir graduated from the University of Nairobi. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. CHEPKOK: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will do what the Assistant Minister has requested next week, but I want to put to him that the Ministry sent Mr. Chirchir to the Soviet Union‚Äî‚Äî </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Chepkok, you are supposed to put your supplementary Question and I am sure you can do this quickly. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. CHEPKOK: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister tell the House why Mr.Chirchir was not paid his salary and bursary after the Ministry sponsored him to study in Moscow? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. AMAYO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, Mr. Chirchir was awarded a scholarship by the Soviet Union and the Ministry stopped paying him his salary because the course he was pursuing, machine engineering, was not relevant to his career as a secondary school teacher. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. MISOI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I thank the Assistant Minister for telling us that this gentleman pursued a course that was not relevant to-his teaching career. What was" he supposed to pursue in Moscow? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. AMAYO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, perhaps it might be necessary to clarify here that under the Teachers Service Commission regulation No.59, teachers can go for further studies with or without pay. In this case, Mr. Chirchir went to the Soviet Union on a course which, he could not come back and use in teaching in a secondary school. He was initially irregularly issued with a letter indicating that he could continue to be paid his salary. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. WASIKE-NDOMBI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if I am an "S1" teacher and I go to Harvard University, then I come back with my Doctor of Philosophy degree, can I be compelled to go to teach in a secondary school? Is the Assistant Minister not misleading us by saying that if I leave Kenya with a certain level of education and I attain further aducation abroad, I come backMR. WASIKE‚ÄîNDOMBI (CTD.)and continue being in the same level of education I left with, particularly in the teaching profession? In any case, we have gone technical. Why does the Assistant Minister say that machine engineering is not relevant to the educational system in Kenya? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. AMAYO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, in 1980/81, this course was not relevant to Mr. Chirchir's teaching career. The other point we need to clarify here is that we are talking about Mr. Chirchir having pursuing a Doctor of Philosophy degree whereas the agreement he had with the Ministry of Education was to go for a masters degree, and he never reviewed this agreement to enable him to study for a Doctor of Philosophy degree. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. P.G. GODANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, is the Assistant Minister in order to insist that the course that Mr. Chirchir took is not relevant to his career whereas Mr. Chirchir is not condemned to teach in a secondary school? He could teach mechanical engineering at a higher level. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. AMAYO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think I explained this point .well enough. Mr. Chirchir ought to have got in touch with his employer to indicate that he wanted to go beyond a masters degree. We are informed that Mr. Chirchir is pursuing a Doctor of Philosophy degree, but as far as our records in the Ministry are concerned, we are not aware of this fact. </NEWSPEECH>Question No. 546<HEADER>Rehabilitation of Eldorect Furfural Plant</HEADER>DR. MISOI asked the Minister for Industry what the outcome of the study undertaken to rehabilitate the furfural plant in Eldoret was.<NEWSPEECH>MR.

A.H.O. Momanyi asked the Minister for Co-operative Development when the coffee farmers of Gesarara and Kemera Farmers Co-operative Societies will be paid their dues. <NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR CO-OPERATIVE DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Cheruiyot): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the answer I have here is inadequate, and I be to reply to this Question next Tuesday when I will have got full information. </NEWSPEECH>Question No. 558 <HEADER>Milk Cooler for Kapenguria Township</HEADER>MR. LOTIM asked the Minister for Co‚Äîoperative Development whether, since dairy farming has taken root in Kapenguria Constituency, he could direct the management of the Kenya Co‚Äîoperative Creameries Ltd. to establish a milk cooler in Kapenguria Township.<NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR CO-OPERATIVE DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Cheruiyot):Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.According to the long-term development programme of the Kenya Co-operative Creameries Ltd., a milk cooling and collection centre is earmarked for development in Makutano, Kapenguria neighbourhood, West Pokot District, in the 1992/93 Financial Year, subject to the availability of funds. To facilitatye quicker implementation of this project once funds are available, it is essential for the relevant district development committee to approve the location of the project and allocate a five-acre plot for the purpose. Therefore it is not necessary for the Kenya Co-operative Creameries Ltd. to be given any directive on this matter as it is already in its plans. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OMINO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, is the Minister telling us that he has made provision for this centre in his forward budget since funds do not become available on their own' without having' being made available by someone? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. CHERUIYOT: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is a major study towards setting up cooling plants and collection centres throughout the Republic, and we have catered for this particular project. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.EKIDOR: What is the estimated cost of the project? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH> MR. CHERUTYOT: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the year 1992 is a long way off with the current Gulf Crisis it is impossible for me to say how much the project will cost at that time. I am not competent to tell how much the project will cost in 1992. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. A.H.O. Momanyi' s Question. </NEWSPEECH>Question No.533<HEADER>Preservation of Cypress Forests InKitutu Masaba</HEADER><NEWSPEECH>MR. A.H.O. M0MANYI asked the Minister for Environment and Natural Resources since the cypress plantations in KitutuMasaba Constituency are drying out and farmers are losing a lot of revenue, what urgent steps the Ministry is taking to prevent further destruction of these plantations. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES (Dr. Mungai): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, before I give my reply, I would first of all apologise for yesterday on behalf of the Ministry. They were not able to be here on time and I was tied up elsewhere. I thank the Deputy Leader of Government Business for the explanation he gave.Having said that, I beg to reply.My Ministry is aware of the trees dying from the Cypress Aphid attack in KitutuMasaba Constituency and farmers are being advised to spray their hedges and plantations using Ambush, Karate and Diasnon with white oil chemicals. To make this effective public barazas are being organized by the Forest Officers and the provincial administration to enlighten the members of the public on the measures to take to prevent further destruction of cypress trees. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. MISOI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, while thanking the Minister for that reply, could, he tell this House what plans the Ministry has to safeguard our extensive cypress forests? My Constituency has large cypress forests. What is the Ministry doing to protect our forests from attack "by the cypress aphid? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR.MUNGAI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have plans to safeguard our forests - both cypress and cedar forests, let me just mention here that, we have about 280,000 hectares of indigenous cedar plantations; 86,000 hectares of industrial cypress plantations and about 30,000 hectares of cypress and cedar plantations held in the rural farm areas. We have teamed, equipped with these chemicals that I have mentioned, some vehicles and motorised spray equipment to spray the forests. We are going to seek advice from the Government and if funds are available we will use aerial sprays to safeguard all these forests in Kenya because they are worth a lot of money. But right now we have teams going round the forests spraying the forests. We cannot afford to rest because these forests are extremely important to this country.In fact, just before I left Kenya for an overseas trip, I had given instructions to the Forest Officer to come and spray this hedge here outside Parliament so that hon. Members of Parliament could see what we are doing and with what. He came and gave a demonstration and sprayed this hedge outside Parliament Buildings. The matter is really under control. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.A.K.KINYANJUI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, is the Minister aware that the Cypress Aphid is attacking forests all over the country and particularly in the Uplands area? What urgent measures is the Minister taking now to save our forests from destruction? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. MUNGAI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have just explained the steps we are taking to control the spread of the Cypress Aphid. I have said that there are about 400,000 hectares of cypressand cedar which could be affected. we are doing the best we can to control the aphid. We are very happy that this information is being brought to us. We are trying to publicise this matter and to give information to our people through the District Officers and Forest Officers; through the radio, television and newspapers about the dangers of this disease so that all of us can combat it as much as we can. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.MAKAU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, arising from that reply from the Minister, what measures is the Ministry taking to make sure that people are not exploited? I say this because our cypress trees in Mbooni Constituency are badly affected by this disease. But some private people have started spreading some pamphlets saying that they can do that job. what measures is the Ministry taking to make sure that farmers are not exploited by these people who want to take advantage of this disease? Some private companies are saying that they can spray trees. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR.MUNGAI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, that is a good and fair question. I say this because there are very many pesticides being sold here that should not be sold in this country. we have forest stations, we have district offices and people must report there and our forest officers will help them to identify the disease and advise them as to what chemicals they should use to spray their trees. I must also mention that some of these chemicals are injurious to the health of human beings. Therefore precautionary measures should be taken. These instructions are always given. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.A.H.O.MOMANYI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, could the Minister tell the House whether this cypress aphid can affect human beings? Back at home people are being told that if they use wood from trees that have been killed by this disease they will suffer from cancer and even go blind and so on. Is that true? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. MUNGAI : Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, could the hon. Member repeat his question? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. A.H.O. M0MANYI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am requesting the Minister to clarify this matter. This is because at home a rumour is going round that if you use wood from trees that have been killed by the Cypress. Aphid you will suffer from cancer and even go blind. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MUNGAI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if the hon. Member is talking about the pest Aphid that does affect people. But I have said that one Chemicals used to spray the trees should be handled with care. You have to take the usual precautions because the chemicals can be injurious to health; just like many other chemicals. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.P.K.KINYANJUI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, since we did not have these aphids in the past, could the Minister tell us where they came from and for how long they will last in this country? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. MUNGAI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I can tell the hon. Member for kikuyu where the pest came from. But I cannot tell him how long it is going to last here because that will depend on the steps that we are going to take to destroy it. Originally the aphids came from the Mediterranean areas. From there they spread to the countries in the Southern part of Africa - Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Tanzania and then Kenya. They were first noticed in kajiado District where His Excellency the Vice-President- and Minister'' for Finance was kind enough to start spraying trees there - in March this year. After that the disease has been spreading to Kiambu, Narok, Nairobi, Machakos, South Tyansa, Kericho, Murang'a, HyaMra,Kisii, Nyeri and Embu. The pest spreads so fast because it is airborne. Some of the pests have wings while others do not have wings. The only thing we can do is to spray as fast as we can and that is why I have suggested that will have to go to the Government and ask whether we can get enough money - and it is going to be a lot of money so that we can use aerial spray. This is because we have to move very fast because the pests have wings and are moving very fastDR.MUNGAI (CTD.) That is one way of trying to control the disease, However there are many hedges in individual homes and we would like to advise the home-owners to buy the chemicals I have mentioned and spray their own hedges; it is within the ability of the owners of homes with these hedges, farm and agricultural land to do this. The 400,000 hectares of forests that we have is worth colossal amount of money and we are doing our best to spray and stop this disease in these forests. In fact, in southern parts of African, thousands upon thousands of hectares of cypress and cidar trees have been destroyed. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MRS. NDETEI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, hon. Momanyi asked the Minister whether it is harmful to use affected trees as firewood because it has been rumoured in his area that if one uses an affected tree as firewood, tears will come out of their eyes and they either go blind or develop cancer. When the Minister answered, he only touched on the chemical aspect of the matter he did not clarify whether it is dangerous or not to use affected trees as firewood. Can he come out clearly on this point because the majority of the people who are likely to be affected in this country are women and children? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. MUNGAI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will come out clearly because it is also clear now; before it was not clear whether the hon. Member was talking about the chemical or the aphid itself. When a tree dies of aphid, the best thing is to cut it down and use it for fuel wood; it would not harm an individual in any way when it burns. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. MISOI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, can the Minister assure Kenyans that these chemicals are available throughout the country? If not, what is the Ministry doing to ensure that we have them? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. MUNGAI: Mr. Deputy Speaker the chemicals are available in the country and that is why I have mentioned them. I have not mentioned those which are not available in the country it would not be of any use for me to talk about chemicals that are not available in Kenya. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. P. G. GODANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister has narrated only the short-term measures. But, according to available information, the best long-term measure, and the one that is environmentally desirable, is a biological tradition. What steps has the Ministry taken to import a predator to this country? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. MUNGAI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I agree with the hon. Member. The Kenya Forestry Research Institute, Muguga, the universities and other institutions are conducting experiment to find out whether they can get a bilogical cure for this disease. But before they are able to get effective results, we still have to spray to stop the disease from spreading. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.

DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Bidu is still not here; very well, the Question is dropped. </NEWSPEECH>(Question dropped) Question No. 544<HEADER>Delay in Hearing Civil Cases in Mombasa</HEADER>MR. EKID0R, on behalf of Mr. Lewa, asked theAttorney-General:-(a) what has delayed the hearing of High Court Civil Cases Nos. 1121, 1123 and 1223 of 1979, Mombasa and(b) when these cases will be finalised.<NEWSPEECH>THE ATT0RNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I beg to reply.All these case are related in that they arose out of a road accident of 13.3.78 along Kaloleni-Kilifi Road at Chonyi in Kilifi District. The three cases involve three minors, namely Vincent Tatu; Winston Tanya and Ngala Mwangoma. The three suits were consolidated and brought by Mr. Winston Tuiya behalf of the minors; the defendant Mr. Jonathan Ngoijbao, the owner of the vehicle, was held liable over the road accident. But before the damages were determined Jonathan NguJibao, the defendant, filed an appeal in the Court of Appeal challenging the issue of liability. The question of liability was determined and the Court of Appeal dismissed Mr. Nguibao's appeal on 10.3.88 on the ground that Mr.Kguijibao was liable.Now what remains now is the determination of damages. The advocate of the plaintiff has to fix a hearing date for determination of the amount of damages payable to these minors. I am afraid to say that the plaintiff and his advocate have not taken that step. It is upon them now to move as quickly as possible and fix a hearing date for the determination of amount of damages to these minors. That all I can say; the rest remains sub judice. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.EKIDOR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, can the Attorney-General tell the House whether he is in short of judges because there very many cases pending in the High Court of Kenya? If the answer is in the affirmative, will he tell the House when will appoint more judges so that they can speed up hearing of cases in the High Court of Kenya? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MULI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, that is a different question which is also irrelevant to the original Question. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.MAKAU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, is the Attorney-General aware that there is an outcry in the country, and in my area in particular, from people whose claim proceeds have been paid to lawyers but the lawyers have not paid the same to accident victims? If he is aware, what is he doing to sort out this problem? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MULI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, that is a fair question, although it is not subsidiary to the original Question. But I am quite happy to state that I am aware and action has always been taken against advocates who have converted clients money to their own use; we have prosecuted many of such advocates.Further, during the last Sitting the Advocates Act was amended by this House. One of the amendments made provided for the establishment of a Complaints Commission. I am happy to say that a judge has been attached to this commission, which, will be housed in the one corner of the High Court of Kenya. This commission will remain open to receive complaints of that nature, whereupon the commission will recommend action in one way or the other. I thought I should give out that information to the House. Thank You , Sir. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. CHEPKOK: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, sometimes lawyers are given money to pay to their clients by the Government but they do not do so. What guarantee can the Attorney-General give that this practice will stop? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MULI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the question by hon. Makau covers the points raised by hon. Chepkok. If anyone has a complaint against an advocate or a firm of advocates, the he should make his way as quickly as possible to the Complaints Commission at the High Court Buildings and he will be attended to. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Well. Let us go back to Mr. Kimemia's Question. </NEWSPEECH>Question No. 515 <HEADER>Payment of retirement Benefits to Mr. King'ori</HEADER>MR. KIMEMIA asked the Minister for Labour when Mr. Patrick King'ori, FM/No. 205 695 418, who retired in 1987, will be paid his benefits.<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. Ole.Kaparo): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Minister for Labour, I beg to reply. But, before I do that‚Äî </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KIMEMIA: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. When I asked this Question for the first time the Assistant Minister was sitting there and he did not stand up to reply. Can he first of all apologise for that? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. ole Kaparo): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not wish to apologise for being where I was sitting, but I wish to apologise for not answering the Question at the time. The reason for not answering the Question when it was called for the first time is that I had not received, the answer from the Ministry of Labour.Having done that, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I wish to give the following reply on behalf of the Minister for Labour.The claimant applied to withdraw his benefits on 21st October, 1988, stating that he had worked for the Kenya Railways Corporation from 1966 to 1987, but failed to enclose his original payslip or documents showing that he was a contributor to the Fund. The claimant did not furnish this information despiteTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. OleKaparo) (CTD.)letters Ref. Nos. SF/C/W/205695418/8 and 10, 15 and 18 of 25th May, 1989, 6th March, 1990 and 30th March, 1990 respectively . However, on 2nd July, 1990, the claimant sent his payslip and dockets and the same were forwarded with the contribution schedule to his former employer, to fill and return with all the contributions to enable the Fund to pay the claimant. Since the Fund's records show that no contributions have been received.The claimant will have to wait until the Kenya Railways Corporation has returned the schedule together with his contributions. As of now there are no funds belonging to the claimant in the National Social Security Fund and, consequently, the Fund will not be in a position to pay the claimant. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KIMEMIA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this man was working with the Kenya Railways Corporation and, as we know, it is the Government policy to deduct the money from the employee. Why did the Minister not ask the corporation why they did not forward this man's contributions? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. ole KAPARO: Mr. deputy Speaker, Sir, as I said, the Ministry has sent the contribution schedule to the Kenya Railways Corporation requesting them to fill in the forms and return the* schedule together with the contribution to the Fund. That has not been done by the corporation and, therefore, I cannot say that the corporation did not deduct the money from the claimant. I am only asking the hon. Member to be patient while the' Ministry of Labour follows up the question of remittance of deductions with the Kenya Railways Corporation. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KIMEMIA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this person retired in 1987 and therefore, has no any source to get money to support his family. For how long is he going to wait before he is paid these benefits? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. ole KAPARO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the claimant himself cannot be totally absolved from blame. As I said when I was giving the original reply, the claimant did not reply to several letters written to him seeking certain vitalMR. Ole KAPARC (CTD.)information until 2nd July, 1990, when he responded to letters that were written to him as far back as March, 1989. A letter of 22nd May </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KIMEMIA: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister has not answered my question. For how long is this man going to wait before he is paid his benefits? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: I thought the Assistant Minister was in the: process of answering that question. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. ole KAPARO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, he was making it appear like the Ministry of Labour-was unable to assist Mr. King'ori, but I was saying that the claimant himself is partly to blame for the delay. From May, 1989, when the Ministry wrote to him seeking certain vital information, he never responded until 2nd July, 1990. Now that he has given the necessary information, the Ministry of Labour has contacted the Kenya Railways Corporation and will continue doing so. But until the National Social Security Fund received the contributions from the former employer, there is no way the Fund can pay this claimant. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Let us now move on to Dr. Misoi's Question for the second time. </NEWSPEECH>Question No. 546<HEADER> Rehabilitation of Eldoret Furfural Plant </HEADER><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Still nobody here to respond to this Question? We will defer it then. </NEWSPEECH>(Question deferred)<HEADER>QUESTIONS BY PRIVATE NOTICE</HEADER><HEADER>Provision of Water to Wangige Clinic</HEADER><NEWSPEECH>MR. P.K. KINYANJUI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Health the following Question by Private Notice.MR. P.K. KINYANJUI (CTD.)	(a) What steps is the Minister taking to provide water to Wangige Health Centre? (b) Since all medical services have stopped due to lack of water, would the Minister the emergency measures by delivering water to the centre by tankers until a permanent solution is found? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Ogur): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The following steps have been taken to provide water to Wangige Health Centre since the borehole which was in the facility broke down.(a) The Medical Officer of Health, Kiambu, has purchased six 20-litre jerry cans to be used by the health staff to provide water to the health centre. Besides this, an order to purchase a 270-litter container has been placed by the Medical Officer of Health, Kiambu, to ensure that water is available at the health centre' all the time.(b) A contractor by the name Lucas Karanja of Wangige township, Lower Kabete, has been appointed by the Medical Officer of Health, Kiambu, to be supplying the health centre with water daily until when the borehole will be repaired.Further, Sir, a 2000-litre water tank which serves as a reservoir for the health centre is being repaired. Once it is repaired, it will be used to store water for the facility.(c) Provision of medical services at the health centre has not stopped as claimed by the hon. Member. Services are being rendered at the health centre as usual. Cases which need a lot of water have always been referred to the nearby health facilities. The Medical Officer of Health, Kiambu, has been asked to monitor the situation closely and take any further action when necessary. </NEWSPEECH>	.<NEWSPEECH>MR. A.K. KINYANJUI: I thank the Assistant Minister for his reply which shows a lot of goodwill. It seems he was misinformed because I was at the health centre on Monday this week at 5.30 p.m. and there was not a officer single officer to attend to the sick. If a patient were to be taken there in critical condition, he would die because there would nobody to attend to him. Can he tell us the permanent plans he has to ensure that this health centre has water on permanent basis so that the people of this area can benefit? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. 0GUR: Sir, I have just stated that once this reservoir is repaired, there will be no water shortage in this health centre. In the meantime, what I have just said will continue assisting the people. The Ministry is very concerned to see that the water tank now under repair is completed as soon as possible. For now, the measures that we have taken are sufficient. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. K. KINYANJUI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member has just said that he was at the health centre on Monday and he did not find a single staff of the centre there because they claimed that they could not work without water. Does the Assistant Minister understand that that is the situation in most health centres in Kiambu District? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. 0GUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am not here to argue about the staff of the health not having been present at the time when, the hon. Member visited the place because it would be a very big argument. If it about water, I would like to say that we have already taken action. We have given instructions to the medical officer of health to appoint Mr. Karanja and ask him to supply water to the health while we repair the reservoir. With regard to staff absenteeism, I will take serious action. There will be no time when the health centre will lack water because we know that it needs water. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. A.K.KINYANJUI: As I said earlier, the Assistant Minister had shown a lot of goodwill in his initial reply and I commend him for that. But it seems he has been fed with the wrong information. In the first place, patients have been sent away from this health centre due to lack of water. No water has been delivered to this health centre in 20 litre jerricans contrary to what he is saying. There is no evidence to that effect and I maintain that he has been fed with wrong information. In respect, of the tank that he said is being repaired, I examined it personally and it was lying idle. That tank is probably 20 years old and it is irreparable; it needs replacement. Does the Assistant Minister agree with me that this tank needs replacement and not repair? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR: Sir, I do not agree with that. Repairs to this tank are estimated to cost only Kshs.2, 000.00. This will mainly involve welding. We cannot replace it with a new tank only to save Kshs.2,000.00. This is very cheap according to the Ministry. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. MISOI: Sir, the hon. Member who asked this Question has explained in clear terms the problems facing his people. The Assistant Minister is now telling us about repairs to a water tank which will, obviously, not service the needs of these people. Can the Assistant Minister make arrangements to visit this health centre and see the problems for himself so that he can get the right solution to this problem? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, my visit to the health centre will not do the welding required on this water tank. I have already given instructions for the welding to be done. </NEWSPEECH>(laughter)<NEWSPEECH>MR. A.K.KINYANJUI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister said that patients have been referred from this health centre to a nearby health centre. Can we know which health centre this is and how far it is from Wangige Health Centre? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.OGUR: Sir. The term referal of a patient from one health institution to another does not matter be it from Wajir to Kenyatta National Hospital and so on. When specialist treatment is required, patients in question are referred to a specific health institution. In this case, there are a lot of health facilities near Wangige Health Centre. These are Nyathuma Health Centre, Kihara Health Centre, Karuri Health Centre, Uthiru Dispensary, G	ichuru Dispensary and Kiambu District Hospital with a lot of trained staff. The distance between each one of these facilities is so short that one can walk there, cycle, oroeven fly. It is very short, indeed. </NEWSPEECH>(laughter)<NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Let us move on to Mr. Ekidor' s Question. </NEWSPEECH><HEADER>Poor Financial Management in Loawar High School</HEADER><NEWSPEECH>MR.EKIDOR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Education the following Question by Private Notice.(a) what factors led the Board of Governors of Loawar High School to incur a debt of Kshs.600,000.00 (Six hundred thousand shillings)?(b) Why are the students being forced to pay Kshs.300.00 each to clear the said debt?(c) Why have the books of SEE account of this school not been audited for the last three years? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Ajnayo): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(a) In 1987, the Ministry of Education approved establishment of an additional stream at Lodwar High School on Harambee basis. The said class was initially established using credit facilities because the Board of Governors could not raise adequate funds to run this class. Furthermore, the headmaster of this school, employed four non-teaching staff in 1987 without the authority of the Board of Governors or the Ministry. This non-teaching staff continued to draw salaries that were not catered for in the approved grants payable to the school.THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Amayo) Ctd	The four non-teaching staff were in the categories of one copy-typist, one accounts clerk and two groundsmen who were sacked by the Board of Governors after one year. Another factor that led to the rising debt was prompted because of the rising cost of food and other services.(b) The Ministry if not aware that the students at Lodwar High School are being forced to pay Kshs.300.00. We are however, aware that the Board of Governors and the Parents Teachers Association mutually agreed that each parent should pay Kshs.300.00 per student to offset the debt in question.(c) The delay in auditing the books of accounts for Lodwar High School was prompted by lack of a qualified accounts clerk because the Board of Governors had sacked an inefficient accounts clerk before. These books of accounts are presently being audited by the district schools auditor. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.EKIDOR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister give us the breakdown of this amount? We would like to know how much was used for putting up the Harambee classroom, how much the cost of food was and how much was used to pay the staff. We would like to have this breakdown because there seems to be something amiss. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.AMAY0: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not have the breakdown of the figures with me at the moment, but hon. Ekidor is a member of this particular Board. However, if we are given time, we would be able to give the breakdown of the costs involved. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. TERER: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister tell the House why the Ministry allowed this school to start a Harambee Scheme without supporting funds and adequate facilities? I think this is the cause of this debt. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. AMAYO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, perhaps it is important at this stage to explain the circumstances involved. Lodwar High School is the only, boy's secondary-school in Lodwar District. Due to the increasing number of pupils from primary school, the Board requested for the establishment of Harambee stream in the said school and the approval was given for them to start this additional stream on a harambee basis. At that particular time since this is a hardship area, the parents were not able to raise enough money through Harambee. Since the school fees paid by the students in the Harambee stream is the same as that paid by student in the Government aided stream, the items required, such as uniform, beds, mattresses and so on, were bought on credit on the understanding that when the school fees were paid on time, the school would be able to offset the debt in question. The school fees at Lodwar High School is only Shs.2,130/- per student per year and about 40 per cent of each student' s fees is paid by donors. The irregularity here is that donors at times do not pay the amount in question on time and therefore, the Shs.300/- per student was to be paid just to offset part of the total debt of Shs.600,000/-, which todate has been reduced by Shs.250-0,000/ which means that the current debt is Shs.350,000/-. So, these are some of the circumstances that led this particular school to incur this debt.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, regarding the question of books of accounts for this particular school, I would like to inform the house district that they are now being audited by the district /schools auditor. 'Therefore, we are not in a position to know the magnitude of any irregularities until the auditor's report is out. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MAKEANU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, arising from the Assistant earlier Minister's/reply that the Headmaster employed non-teaching staff without the authority of the Board of Governors or the Minister. This is an irregularity that has been committed by heads of schools all over the country, would be tell us what action the Ministry has taken against this headmaster? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.AMAYO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the first action- x that was taken was to stop the irregular employment. Although this particular headmaster was transferred from this school, this was not specifically because of recruiting four unqualified people. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MRS.NDETEI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, in view of the fact that Turkana is one of the hardship areas in that it is one of the driest areas in this country and obviously, the parents are finding extreme difficulties in paying this money, could the Ministry consider paying this particular debt on behalf of the school? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. AMAYO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Education is not 2 in a position to repay the debt incurred by LodwarEigh School Earambeestreame because arrangements are being made by the schools Board of Governors and the Parents Teachers Association of the school to offset the debt in question </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.EKIDOR: Mr. Deputy -Speaker, Sir, on the 29th September, 1990, we had a Parents Teachers Association meeting and one of the Agenda to be discussed was why the Headmaster of this school was forcing the students to pay Shs.300/- to clear this debt, unfortunately, the Chairman of the Parents and Teachers Association and the District Officer did not attend this particular meeting. The Assistant Minister has told the House that the parents have paid Shs.250, 000/- to clear off this debt and he went further to say that the Board of Governors and the Parents/Teachers Association agreed to offset this debt. Could he lay on the Table of this House the minutes of the BoardMR.EKIDOR (CTD.)	meeting which recommended that the students pay Shs.300/- each to offset this debt. We would like to know who attended this Board meeting. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.AMAYO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there was a Board meeting for Lodwar High School chaired by hon. Ejore who is the Chairman of the Board and Member of Parliament for Lodwar Central on 14th July, 1990.This meeting was followed by a Parents/Teachers Association meeting on the 29th of September which is the one that approved the subsequent payment of the Shs.300/- per student.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, just to give a brief history of this school, I would like to inform the House that this particular school used to be in the hon. Ekidor's constituency and the last Boundaries Review Commission brought it into hon. Ejore's constituency. This is the only boys secondary school in Lodwar and hon. Ekidor also happens to be a member of Board of Governors for this school. I would like to remind him that there is a Board meeting scheduled to take place on Saturday 3rd Mover, 1990, that is the day after tomorrow and he would assist us a great deal by introducing this subject in that Board meeting. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. MISOI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, since we all are aware that Lodwar is very difficult area, if parents are to be forced to pay Shs.300/-, this would prove very difficult for them. Could the Assistant Minister clarify the difference between a child being sent home to correct Shs.300/- and the parent being asked to pay Shs.300/- ? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. AMAYO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not understand the difference the hon. Dr. Misoi is talking about. However I am saying that we have no information in the Ministry at the moment indicating that the students in this school have been sent home to look for school fees. .This was a local decision by the Lodwar community and if now they consider this decision inappropriate, they can reverse it and possibly organize a Harambee meeting to collect the money. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.KIRWA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is need for the Assistant Minister to clarify this issue further. Hon.Ekidor has said quite clearly that on the 29th of September that the meeting that was supposed to take placeMR.KIRWA (CTD.)	did not actually materialise just because some crusial members of that meeting did not appear. Nevertheless, the Assistant Minister goes ahead and says that the action of 14th July meeting, was ratified on the 29th September meeting. Could we be put into a clear picture as to whether the meeting did take place or not. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. AMAYO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there was a meeting on the 29th September and given the time, we can be able to produce the minutes of that Board meeting as well as those for the Parents/Teachers Association meeting. However, as I did indicate, there is a Board meeting scheduled for Saturday the 3rd of November, that is the day after tomorrow, which could revert that decision and since hon. Ekidor is a Member of the Board, he could perhaps raise the matter at the forum in question. </NEWSPEECH><HEADER>BILL</HEADER><HEADER>The Lake Basin Development Authority (Amendment) Bill</HEADER>(The Assistant Minister for Regional Development (Mr. Muturia) on 31.10.90)(Resumption of Debate interrupted on 31.10.9Q) <NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: I understand that this Bill was moved by hon. Muturia and seconded by hon. Kamwithi Munyi, and the latter still has a few minutes to his credit. If he was here, he might perhaps have wanted to speak, but I notice that he is not here at the moment. </NEWSPEECH>(Question proposed) <NEWSPEECH>MR. JALANG'O: Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me an opportunity to contribute to this very important Bill. The Lake Basin Development Authority was set up in 1979 originally covering 14 districts. A part of this amendment bill seeks to place additional districts under cover. These districts are Kericho, Nandi , UasinGishu and Trans Nzoia. This addition gives the Authority jurisdiction over nearly one‚Äîthird of Kenya and over slightly over 40 per cent of the country‚Äôs population. By normal standards, this is an extremely large Authority, not only in terms of acreage, but also of population. Over the last 10 years, the Authority has received an annual grant from the Government of approximately Shs.35, 000/. Considering the size of this Authority, the Authority has not been very effective in rendering services to the area under its jurisdiction.[Mr. Deputy Speaker left the Chair][The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Kagwima) took the Chair] People have been asking what the Authority is exactly doing. I made a survey recently and looked at the statistics involved. I came up with the conclusion that, in view of the size of the area covered by the Authority, there is need for the Authority's budget to be proportionately increased so that the effectiveness of the Authority may be felt. Now that four more districts are going to be added to the Authority, the Authority may not, especially during this financial year, be able to effectively offer the intended services to theMR. JALANG'O (CTD.) community.I take the reclamation of Yala Swamp, one of the major programmes of this Authority, as an example. Yala Swamp reclamation requires approximately Shs.0.5 billion in order to render approximately 12,000 hectares of land useful. Obviously, as a result of such reclamation, firstly, land, will be made available to landless people and, secondly, room will be made available for setting up some industries there, especially in Siaya District, which lacks any viable industries at the moment. Thirdly, robusta coffee, which has been proved to be very successful in the area, will now be grown in a big way especially under irrigation.			Time and time again, we have requested the Ministry of Regional Development for the reclamation of Yala Swamp. Apart from the setting up of industries, we see direct availability of employment opportunities to, at least, 100,000 people in the area as a result of this reclamation. Over and above that, there is the Rain Rice Project in the area. It has not been very easy for the Authority to embark on this project because of lack of adequate funds. I would like to make a very special appeal at this time when we are amending this Bill. The Ministry should seriously consider the role of the Authority', whose effectiveness can only be matched by the availability of adequate funds.During the last two years, the Lake Basin Development Authority has been trying an experimental project involving the growing of fruits and vegetables. From the results that were obtained, this particular project proved to be extremely successful, but, as a result of lack of enough funds, it was not possible for the Authority to embark on this very ambitious project. This country is purely agricultural and agriculture is the main backbone of Kenya's economy. So, an Authority like this could, if properly supported, organised and monied, be the central granary of the country. I notice that the areas around Nandi, UasinGishu and Trans Nzoia are currently very high potential agriculturally. The only way in. which the inclusion of these additional districts could be effective is by providing proportionate funds to the AuthorityMR. JALANG'O (CTD.) It is very easy to give the Authority additional acreage without necessarily looking at the financial aspect of the matter.' Obviously additional staff will be required to cover this extra area, but, without adequate funds, the Authority will continue to be ineffective. Comparing this Authority with other authorities of similar size, such as the Tana and Athi Rivers Development Authority, Kerio Valley Development Authority, and so on, you will find this Authority receives only 10 per cent of what the other authorities receive. Obviously, what these other authorities are doing is different, but I strongly feel that the only way in which the Authority could be made effective is by increasing -its funding substantially so" that it may cover all the 17 districts - that it is going to serve after this Bill is passed.This Authority has been unable to implement the very many projects it has had in its 14 districts of jurisdiction, and it has been accused of writing many research papers. It is true that a research paper has to be written before any project can be embarked on because no project can be implemented before a feasibility study has .been done, the cost element is calculated and the rate of return on investment is determined. These things have already been done in the case of the Lake Basin Development Authority but, unless adequate funds are available, leaders will continue to ask what the role of the Authority is. I am a very firm supporter of the Authority and, time and time again, I have had a chance to talk to various management staff in the Authority. However, 10 years after the formation of the Authority, we continue to ask province wise and district wise what tangible project the Authority- has come up with.MR. JALANG'O (CTD.)Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker. Sir, I have come to the v conclusion that the aims of the L.B.D.A. were very novel but that one major handicap that the L.B.D.A. has had over the years is lack of adequate in as far as the size of the L.B.D.A. is concerned. Sooner or later the Sondu-Mriu Project is going to come up. One component of the Sondu-Mriu Project, obviously, is the generation of hydro-electric power which is handled by a different Authority. But there is also the other aspect of irrigation which will come about as a result of the implementation of the Sondu-Mriu Project. Unless the funds are made available and this country being an agricultural country as I have said before the other component of the Sondu-Mriu Project will be ineffective.Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to appeal to the Ministry of Regional Development to make funds available for the implementation of the irrigation component of the Sondu-Mriu Project. It has been proved that there is no soil that is better suited for irrigation than the black cotton soil. Most of the area covered by the L.B.D.A. is very rich in black cotton soil. Agricultural experts say that the black cotton soil just requires plenty of water and very little fertiliser. The L.B.D.A. area is covered by the vast Lake Victoria and various rivers which come from the Nandi Hills and which pour their waters into Lake Victoria. . These rivers include the famous Nyando River which has been causing havoc through floods not only to human beings but to livestock and crops.	Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think it is high time that the Ministry seriously considered starting a major irrigation project under the L.B.D.A. If the area, covered by the L.B.D.A. is going to be the granary of kenya and especially with the creation of an additional district - would it not be appropriate for the Ministry to seriously consider setting up a major irrigation project under the L.B.D.A.? We have the vast waters of lake Victoria which have never been used for irrigation. One normally wonders why it has become very difficult for the Ministry to set up an irrigation project using the vast waters of lake Victoria.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the waters of lake Victoria, which flow down the River Nile have, for thousands of years, been the lifeline of the Egyptians. There is no other African country which utilises the waters of lake Victoria for irrigation more than Egypt. The life of Egypt depends on the River Nile and the source of River Nile is Lake Victoria. why can we not utilise the waters of lake Victoria for irrigation? Why do we have to import wheat and maize while we have such vast waters of lake Victoria, freely given to us by God? I think it is high time that we seriously considered proper utilisation of the lake Victoria waters. The area covered by the L.B.D.A. is about one-third of Kenya and constitutes about four-fifths of arable land in the whole country, To start with, we could put about 10,000 hectares of land under irrigation. You will find that 10,000 hectares of wheat or maize, would within a period of two years, make this country totally self-sufficient in terms of food.	I would also like to suggest to the Ministry of Agriculture that an initial investment under irrigation of, say, 2,000 hectare of coffee would straightaway change the area under the L.B.D.A. This would make the people within the L.B.D.A, area start serious coffee production. It has been proved that Robusta coffee does very well in the Lake Basin area particularly under constant supply of water.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to say that the only way in which we can intensify food production in the Lake Basin area is to make the L.B.D.A. tick. The L.B.D.A. can only tick if it is given the finances that it deserves. Another amendment to the Bill Concerns the appointment of ex-officio members and appointments by ex-officio members to represent them in various meetings of the L.B.D.A. While I support that idea, I have some reservations. This is because the Bill states clearly who are going to be members of the Board who are going to be ex-officio members of the Board. If it is left open so that when an ex-officio member is unable to attend a Board meeting he is allowed to appoint his own representative I am not sure how effective this will be. Could it not have been spelt out that if Mr. So-and-so, in terms of his position is unable to attend a X Board meeting.The alternate member should also be put in the Bill instead of leaving it open like that, I do not doubt the integrity of those ex-officio members of the Board. I was just thinking that instead of leaving it like that, if the Permanent Secretary of the Provincial commissioner is unable to attend a Board meeting the he should appoint somebody to represent him in the Board. At certain times when major decisions have to be made and which may require the person named in the Act to be present Let me hope that wise counsel will reign during the appointment of those to represent ex-officio members during crucial board meetings.?I also hope that only in very exceptional circumstances will they appoint people to represent them. MR.JALANG‚ÄôC (CTD.)Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to conclude by making the appeal I made earlier that the reclamation of Yala Swamp is a major requirement if the Lake Basin Development Authority (ABDA) is to take off, and more so, if Siaya District is to develop.With those remarks, I Support. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS: ( MR.Miberi ) Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to support the LBDA (Amendment) Bill, 1990. As it is, this amendment has been brought up after 11 years of the existence of the authority. This authority covers a large around Lake Victoria, which enjoys conventional rains. I note from the proposed amendment that the scope of the authority will now include Kericho District. The hon. Member who has spoken just before me said that the source of River Nile is Lake Victoria, but I wish to dispute that by saying that the source of River Nile is in Kericho District. This is because there would be no lake Victoria without the water from Kericno District. We have several rivers Kipsonoi, Chemosit, Ainapkoi which all converge somewhere to form River Malo and flow into lake Victoria. The fact that lake Victoria is where it is makes people think that it belongs to people around Kisumu, while, in fact, we all should have a share of the lake and the LBDA. Nitherto, the authority has not established any project in kemido District. I .hope after this amendment to the Bill the authority will include kericho in its operational areas.The climate of Kericho District is suitable for a number of crops. First of all, presently we are supplying Kisumu and South Districts with milk from Sotik Kenya Co-operative Creameries Factory, which is in my constituency. We would like to supply THE MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (CTD.)More milk because we have good Kikuyu grass, which is suitable for cattle. In this respect, I would like to appeal to the LBDA to start cattle multiplication centres in Kericho. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.OKONDO: On a point of information, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. If the Ministers would accept my point of information , I would like to inform him that the grass in Sotik which he calls "Kikuyu grass" is called "shigondi in that area. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwima): Order .Hon. Okondo, I am not sure whether you stood on a. point of order, or point of information. Can you Clarify your point so that we get it? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. 0KONDO: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I stood on a point of information and made it a subject to the approval of the hon. Minister. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THB MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Mr. Mibei): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I was not ready to be informed and I reject that information forthwith.As I was saying, I would like to appeal to the authority to consider establishing cattle multiplication centres in my constituency and elsewhere in Kericho. We can easily make available 70 acres of land for those cattle multiplication centres.We also require brick-making projects: in some areas we have soil suitable for these projects and out of it we can get bricks similar those made at Sironga in Kisii District. We should produce bricks to enable our people build better houses like in other areas.The authority should also consider creating fish ponds in Kericho. While basically we are cattle keepers, we would also like to eat fish. Although when we talk of fish some people think?THE MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (CTD.)that all fish belong to them, let me remind them that fish belongs to all. Even when were coming from Embu the other day. I saw fish being offered for sale in some parts of Central Province and this shows that it belongs to all Kenyans. It has been proved medically that people, who eat fish, never get a disease called goitre, which is the swelling of the thyroid gland. This is because has certain minerals like iodine, which is a very important element required by the thyroid gland. This is why nobody in Nyanza suffers from goitre, which is a common disease in places where people do not eat fish. I, therefore, wish to appeal to the authority to consider establishing fish ponds in Kericho. If they are not welcome in other parts of Kericho, let them come to my constituency and I will give them all the support to ensure that the project succeeds.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, one hon. Member has praised the starting of the Sonau-Mriu Hydro Electric and Magwagwa Dams, which will benefit people in their locality. But I have discovered that these dams will create problems for about 1,000 people along those rivers in that the dams will take up their land. I would like to appeal to the Ministry of Regional Development which is the LBDA parent Ministry? and the Ministry of Energy, which is the Kenya Power and Lighting Company parent Ministry, to hold joint meetings with the Administration at Loreit Trading Centre in order to inform the people who will be affected by the creation of these dams the value of the dams to them, and also, if they will have to be moved from where they are, where they will be taken. We would like to have clarification on this matter so that people do E not continue living in darkness.THE MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (CTD.)	-So, we would like a clarification so that people do not remain in the dark.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in Clause 3(i) it is recorded that twelve members of the board will be appointed by the Minister. I would like to appeal that when this takes place, then representation from Kericho District should be taken into account. Although our provincial headquarters is Nakuru, since we are in this geographical area, we should take part in the representation on the board. We would not like decisions about a project that will affect Kericho people to be' made' without, representation. Give us about four members in that board.Lastly, Sir, I would like to ask the Ministry to appeal to the staff of this Authority to work extra hard to justify the creation of the Authority. If the staff work hard, the people will be happy and will support them. The Government has created many authorities and it is up to each authority to prove their worth. Even in the employment of staff, the Authority should consider people from that region. Of course, I have in mind Kericho District residents who are the guardians of these rivers which serve the region.With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the Bill. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MNINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Lijoodo):Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I would also like to contribute briefly on the Lake Basin Development Authority (Amendment) Bill which was very ably, moved yesterday by the Assistant Minister "for Regional Development. I want to congratulate my colleague for having moved the Bill so ably yesterday and also support his sentiments on these additions that are intended to make the Authority more effective.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the first major amendment is first of all to widen the scope of the Lake Basin Development Authority by including about five additional districts, that is, Kericho, Nandi, UasinGishu and Trans THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Lijoodi) (CTD.) Nzoia districts. This brings the number of district covered by the Authority to about 15 and that makes the area more realistic. I strongly support the increase of the scope of the Authority, although those of us within the scope of the Authority find it a little bit difficult to justify the existence of the Authority. If you were to ask the ordinary person in Kakamega District what the Lake Basin Development Authority is all about, I do not think they would be' able to tell you. But while we support the increased scope of the Authority and even going to the extent of including the green Kericho District, we are worried about the ability of the Authority to function with the increased responsibility. At the moment, we are hoping that now that the scope has been increased there will be a change in attitude of the Authority to ensure that they will cater for the whole catchment area for which it is mandated.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, what we expect of the Lake Basin Development Authority is a proper utilisation of the development resources within this area. We would like the Authority to start by giving us a proper plan for utilisation of the manpower in the area. If you take some of the more densily populated districts in this area, particularly Kakamega, you find that we have a lot of human beings with able bodies but, because of proper arrangements for their utilisation they are just there. This is an area that rains every year; I have never known a year when it has not rained in Kakamega District since I was born. So, we are blessed by the Almighty God to have these resources and we are expecting that when an Authority like this one is established it will give us the guidance for development of utilisation of the resources in the area so that it-can become more productive than it is at the moment.Now, Sir, the most important factor affecting us is that some parts of the Lake Basin Development area, even before we add on the new districts, are actually food deficit and they have to go to other areas to supplement their food requirements. Many of those areas, such as Bunyore and some parts of Kakamega District, have been producing only sufficient food for about five or six monthsTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Lijoodi) (CTD.)during the year and the rest of the year they have to go to Nandi, Trans Nzoia and UasinGishu district for supplies. These are the same areas mentioned which have rain fall of sufficient quantities every year but, because we do not have sufficient plans for them, they are not able to produce sufficient food. So, we would like to request the Authority to become more active in this area and provide the guidance that is required to ensure that sufficient food is produced.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other amendment is aimed at those ex-officio members, particularly the senior civil servants to appoint their representatives to the board of the Lake Basin Development Authority. But what concerns me more is the representation of the Authority in the various district development committee meetings so that they can provide guidance on the activities which the Authority is carrying out within its area of jurisdiction. The experience we have had in Kakamega District is that we have been unable to have an officer who is senior enough from the Lake Basin Development Authority to attend the district development committee meetings and give us some guidance on the activities of the Authority so that we can marry them with other activities taking place in the district to ensure that there is proper co-ordination. We would like the' Authority to provide the required support to the' district development committee because it is supposed to be the centre for the development of the district. We would like to see' the Authority playing a larger role than it is doing in terms of food production.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, Sessional Paper No. 2 of 1981 - National Food Policy - provided for the district development committee to play a role in ensuring that sufficient food is produced in each district. But, because of the powers that are given to the Lake Basin Development Authority, the co-ordination of the various activities in the attchment area is very important because we do not want to duplicate some of the activities that can be undertaken in other districts to ensure optimum production.THE ASSIATANT MINISTER OF INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Kr. lijoodi) Ctd:The Authority has been short in the delivery of services, the area one area where we want it to ensure that there, is proper co-ordination and effective implementation is that is soil and water conservation. This is because we have major rivers in this catchment area which carry tonnes and tonnes of soil and water every year to Lake Victoria and subsequently to River Nile to enrich the cotton fields of Egypt and the rest of the Arab world. We have nothing against our brothers in Egypt and other areas out I do not think we have any excuse for tonnes and tonnes of our top soil to be carried every year to enable other people to be more productive leaving us in a situation where scare going to have a food deficit. This is because replacing the top soil of any one area takes millions of 5rears. We would like this Authority to give us an elaborate and effective programme for preventing soil erosion and ensuring that we utilize the waters of the rivers of the catchment area more effectively.For quite a long time, before this authority was created, there was a plan to reclaim the Yala swamp which covers more than 5,000 hectares. Even before this authority was created, about ‚Äî </NEWSPEECH>	<NEWSPEECH>MR. OKONDO: On a point of information, Sir. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Lijoodi): Let me finish the point I wanted to make first because I do not want to be interrupted before I deliver the full text of what I wanted to say. Even before this Authority was created, more than 2,600 hectares of the swamp had already been reclaimed. This land was supposed to be utilized for production of the crops that are suitable in that area.I want to make two points in this respect. The first one is that we did not expect the Authority to be involved in direct production of crops wananchi should be producing. The Authority is supposed to be giving us a plan or development strategy for the development of the area under its jurisdiction. We do not expect it to go out to grow millet, maize, sorghum and so on. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH> THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Lijoodi):The wananchi should be given this land for the production of these crops. I hope that when the Yala swap eventually reclaimed, it will be given to the wananchi so that they can produce these crops and not the Lake Basin Development Authority itself.Now that we have additional districts which have made the area bigger and more realistic, I am hoping that the Authority will now go back to the drawing hoard to include the new areas that have been added so that we can have a master plan for the development of the catchment area of the enlarged Lake Basin Development Authority. We would like to ensure that all the district plans that are being drawn up in the districts that are affected take into account the advice giver by the Authority.When I look at my own district, for instance, when we are doing our projections and plans for development, I do not see much of what we are taking into account from the Authority. But I am sure that it has some very useful information which we can make use of to intermarry with what we are doing so that there can be proper co-ordination.	If I may repeat, we are expecting a master plan for the utilization of the resources in the	enlarged area that the Authority is going to be responsible for. So that these are also taken into account by the various areas in question.The Minister said that they have a brick making project but we would like the Authority to concentrating more in the field of apiculture instead of engaging in so many activities which, in the end, may not be productive. This Authority, from what I know, has very experienced officers with the right background in the various disciplines. . I would like to add my voice to what was said by the Member for Rarieada who said that the and Authority is very much under-funded and it is net able to execute its plans effectively because of lack of resources. We hope that with this additional area to be covered, more resources would be made available to the Authority.THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr.Lijoodi) Ctd:This is because even with the present limited area, they do not have the money they require so that they are effectively felt by the people in those areas.I hope that what I have suggested will be taken seriously and that we would see a more effective Lake Basin Development Authority. Thank you. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.MAKAU: Thank you, Sir, for giving me this opportunity. First of all, I would like to say that if there is any development authority that this country does not know what it does, then it is the Lake Basin Development Authority. I am saying so because we, for example, know what the Tana and Athi Rivers Development Authority (Tarda) is doing. Everybody has seen tangible results from that Authority, such as, generation of hydro-electric power. There are horticulture demonstration farms done by Tarda. We also know what the Kerio Valley Development Authority is doing. There is a big development project going on there known as Turkwel Hydro-electric project. This is something tangible.The Lake Basin Development Authority is one of the authorities in this country which nobody can see what it has done for the last 10 years. This Authority should learn from Tarda and the Kerio Valley Development Authority. So that they can know what is expected of them. The role of such an authority is to develop the potentials of the area under its jurisdiction be they agricultural, industrial and so on. I am surprised that the hon. Members from where this Authority is based are asking for more funds from the Government. .A development authority is supposed to be self-funding by initiating projects which will bring forth revenue. It is also supposed to mobilize funds from donor countries order to initiate development projects.If you look at Tarda, Sir, you will see that most of its projects have been initiated through borrowed funds or donations from other countries. For example, the Turkwell Gorge Hydro-electric Power Station is being developed At a cost of Kshs.5 billion through such mobilisation of funds. This is what the Lake Basin Development Authority should have been doing, instead of waiting for government funds. As hon. Jaiang'o said, Kshs. 5 million is spent on administration and that is the end of it.MR.MAKAU (CTD.)Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, if you look at what this particular Authority has done, you would find that it has done very badly due to lack of proper planning. They have concentrated on things that were supposed to be done by the people within the and when you look at their activities, you find that they are very parochial. For example, you would find then rearing chickens instead of starting a demostration farm to teach people how to rear the chickens. So, they are rear these chickens to sell. I understand they also grow millet for sale. They should instead be demonstrating to the people in this area on what to grow instead of doing these little things. Making bricks is a minor issue which has nothing to do with an authority of this magnitude.Having said that, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to say that the function of this Authority are very clearly set out. He know that is the major function of this Authority should be initiate studies end carry out surveys in the area that may considered necessary by the Government or the Authority and to assess alternative demands within the area on the natural resources thereof including agriculture, The Authority should also address itself to the development of forests, worldlife, tourism, electric power generation, Pining and fishing. The Authority should also be able to recommend economic priorities.Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the idea of setting up an authority is to be able to co-ordinate certain activities within a given area. The first thing to do is to negotiate and mobilize enough funds from donors and to use those funds to develop the region. In the case of agricultural development, they should be carrying out demostrations so that farmers can improve on, say, dairy farming. I understand that this particular Authority is also keeping cattle but they should be doing this for demostration purposes instead of keeping the cattle to sell milk. This is where they have gone wrong.Having said that, I would like to talk about the potential that the Lake Development Authority has. This Bill is seeking to widen the scopeMR.MAKAU (CTD.)The Lake Basin Development Authority and will include Kericho and Kandi districts. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>An Hon. Even TransNzoia District. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.MAKAU: Yes. I understand that Trans Nzoia District will also be included. This means that the Authority will cover three provinces, that is, Nyanza, Rift Valley and Western Provinces. Due to the vast area that this Authority is now going to cover, additional funds must be provided. Hon Nicei talked about the creation of additional job opportunities, but we have heard enough politics regarding this Authority as far as employment is concerned. If this Authority is going to function effectively, it is going to cover a vast area comprising of very many people. Therefore, it will be important for them to decentralize their activities. For example, it would be crusial to have telephone offices in Kisii, Kakamega, Harbanet, Kericho and so on instead of having telephone at the headquarters in Hisumu. This would enable the officials working in the Lake Basin Development Authority in the district headquarters to be able to communicate easily with the headquarter. At the moment, I do not know how the recommendations from the district development committees are relayed to the Lake Basin Development Authority. Therefore, since this Authority has now been enlarged, it would be crusial for its operations to be decentralised.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the region that we are talking about is an area with a lot of agricultural potential in this country. Therefore, this Authority should be one of the leading authorities in the socio economic development of this country. Since we recognise the importance of fishing industry in Kenya today, we should make sure that this Authority is given enough money to carry out fishing projects in this area. I am gratified to note that the Minister for Regional Development is very much concerned about the fishing industry in this country and I support him fully. As we very well know, fishing industry is underdeveloped in this country despite the fact that we need fish very badly in this country. Similarly we need a lot of meat in this country and it is unfortunate that where we used to have large ranches, these are now dwindling,MR.MAKAU (CTD.)This means that a time may come when we shall find our self without enough meet and therefore, development of fishing industry is crusial in that beef production is going do. The biggest potential for fish industry is in the Lake Basin Area. This is why I said that this Authority should have thought this potential much earlier. They should have gone to a country like Japan to look for donations to boost the development of fishing industry. I am saying this because Japan is one of the countries in the world which is well known for the development of fishing industries. This is an area where we would be able to do a lot and be able to produce a lot of fish for both domestic consumption and for export.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, countries like Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi, are inhabited by people who like eating fish due to their historical background. So, fish is the staple food for most people in these countries and if we started a fishing industry in Kenya, we would be able to export a lot of fish to these countries and this would earn a lot of money for the Authority. At the moment, the Authority just sits back and waits for Shs.35 million that the Kenya Government is going to give them. In fact, if this Authority worked had, instead of the Government assistance being increased, it would be decreased. They should also be able to solicitate for funds from donor countries.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is also an area which has a lot of potential in sugar production in this country. At the moment, this country depends on the importation of some varieties of sugar, particularly, the while sugar, but this area can make this country to be self-sufficient in sugar production. We have various countries which have been funding sugar industries in this country, for example, the South Nyanza Sugar Factory, Nzoia Sugar Factory and others. The Lake Basin Development Authority should look for funds to develop sugar plantations and enhance the growing of sugar cane in this region so that this country can be self-sufficient in sugar. Today, there are countries that have succeeded in sugar production and I am sure they could look for funds from such countries to expedite sugar production in this country. This is why I am saying that this Authority hasMR. MAKAU (CTD.)not been creative; they have not been able to come out of Kisumu to think about how they can develop the region that they have been put incharge. We might be lucky this time because the chairman who was recently appointed to head this Authority does not come from that region. I hope that he is going to look for ways and means of developing this whole zone rather than being a bit too parochial in development. MR. MAKAU (CTD.)Another potential area in which a lot of development can take place is hydro-electric power generation. The area we are talking about has a lot of rainfall and many rivers. Every now and then, hon. Mruka‚ÄîOwuor and other hon. Members from the area keep on saying in this House that people there are killed by floods. This potential can be harnessed. We can generate hydro-electric power in River Mriu and others. This country needs alternative energy sources. It looks as if the Middle East is not going to be stable for a long time to come, and this country needs alternative sources of energy. The Lake Basin is potential in the provision of hydro‚Äîelectric power and if the Lake Basin Development authority had foresight and was creative, power generation should have been its first priority. We have been getting hydro‚Äîelectric power from Uganda, but we are grateful to His Excellency the President for having foreseen that we would need to be self‚Äîsufficient in the generation of hydro‚Äîelectric power. That is why we have Kerio Valley Development Authority, Turkwell Gorge Project and Tana and Athi Rivers Development Authority. The Lake Basin Development Authority should have foreseen that it could harness the potential of the Lake Basin. Hydro‚Äîelectric power could be generated in Webuye. Which has a lot of such potential.This is why I have been saying that those charged with responsibility in this Authority have been too parochial. They have thought more of Kisumu, Siaya, Karachuonyo and so on than of any other places. Now that Kericho and Nandi Districts have come in, the Authority should have a broad outlook of the region and look for more funds by selling the potential there. At one time Assistant Minister K' Ombudo talked about the beauty of the place and other tourist attractions. A lot can be done to attract tourists to this region.The Authority has done very little of what it intends to do. So, it should be more creative and it should look around at what is happening in Tana and Athi Rivers Development Authority. The area under this Authority is very potential in rice-growing. It does not matter whether the majority of the people in the area are fond of eating fish or not. Rice is a solution to theMR. MAKAU (CTD.)problem Kenya has in feeding its people. I say so because popular countries such as India and Thailand have developed methods of increasing the production of rice, and they are now feeding their people adequately. So, this region is potential in rice production and we can get experts from Thailand to assist us. At the moment, we are importing rice from that country, which is very friendly to Kenya, and we could get expertise from it in respect of rice production to make the Lake Basin supply enough rice to our people.I am very happy that Nandi and Kericho Districts are now going to be included in the Authority. We would expect to get ideas from this region. We want people with creativity. The Authority has done nothing in respect of the fishing industry rice and sugarcane-growing and hydro‚Äîpower generation. We would like the authority to render full services. The Japanese International Co‚Äîoperation Agency can help the Authority a lot in the development of the fishing industry. The Ministry of Regional Development could guide the Authority if only the Authority sought funds from other places. I would like to urge the Ministry to tell the Managing Director of the Authority that it should be more broad-minded and creative.Lastly, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to say that the Authority should do all that we are requesting it to do. Whenever it seeks funds from foreign donors, especially in respect of technical assistance, the Authority should make sure that these donors do not attach any "strings" to their donations. It should, instead, look for genuine donors such as the Japanese International Co‚Äîoperation Agency, for example. The Japanese have been very good in aiding this country, and we have never had them tell us what to do in respect of their aid.MR. MAKAU (CTD.)Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I would like to appeal to those who will be looking for funds to make sure that the technical assistance agreements do specify that Kenya has qualified manpower because we are not looking for manpower. We have qualified manpower in this country. I would also like to urge the Office of the President and the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance to review all technical assistance agreements that have been signed between Kenya and various countries. I say this because at the time these agreements were signed Kenya, did not have the Qualified manpower that we have today. These agreements should be reviewed because 'we are looking for funds to finance our development projects. Donor countries should not bring their own experts into this country just to do work that Kenyans are qualified to do. An example was given a about Norway. They claim that Kenya is going to lose about KShs. l billion in aid from Norway but when you analyse that figure you will find that we are not going to lose anything. You will find that about KShs.500 million was brought to Machakos District under the Machakos Integrated Development programe but the most important project that was implemented under that programe is a dam constructed in koooni Constituency but no pipes were provided. That is why I am saying that these technical assistance agreements should be reviewed. This is because the money that we get from donors ends up paying their own people who come here as experts. It has been said that the HORAD has been spending about KShs.40 million to pay salaries and administrative costs to 28 experts who have been working in HORAD funded projects in this country.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other point that would like to raise here regards the payment of consultancy fees. The donors make that their own people are the ones who are given consultancy work and the money is taken back to those countries. That is why I am calling for a review of the technical assistance agreements. I say this because the recent technical assistance agreement signed between Kenya and the Seychelles stresses the fact that Seychelles would like Kenya to send qualified manpower to the Seychelles to assist them in the development of tourism and other industries in that country. So, the L.B.D.A. should copy and seek advice from the Kerio Valley Development Authority and the Tana, and Athi Rivers Development Authority as to how they should go about their work. The L.B.D.A. now has been expanded to cover Kericho and Mandi Districts and I believe that the officers working under that Authority will redouble their efforts and make the Authority a success.	With those few remarks, I beg to support. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. TERER: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this important Bill. The Lake Basin Development Authority has been expanded through this Bill to include Kericho andMandi Districts. But the problem here is that the Provincial Commissioner, Nyanza, and the Provincial Commissioner Western Province are members of the Board but the Rift Valley Provincial Commissioner has not been included. That is a serious commission. As the hon. Member for Buret said, Kericho District is the source of River Nile. Kericho is the land of streams and rivers that never cease to flow. So, it is actually the source of River Nile and as therefore a lot of attention should be paid to this particular area.MR. TERER (CTD.) MR. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the L.B.D.A. is going to be a very large organisation but my fear is that it may be paralysed by financial constraints. Unless it is adequately funded this Authority may not function efficiently.We have heard of the perenial floods menance in that area covered by the L.B.D.A. and I think this Authority is in a position to contain that flood menace if it is given the necessary funds and the necessary personnel, which has been said about irrigation. We need funds and qualified people to be able to implement irrigation projects in the whole of Nyanza and western Provinces. It is true that if we are really serious we can be self-sufficient in food production. The area covered by the L.B.D.A. has a high agricultural potential. It constitutes about one-third of Kenya's land mass. So, it is a very large area. About 40 per cent of the population of this country is to be found in that area. So, this is a very, very important area.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we need to manage our rivers properly. As has been pointed out, we can introduce dry land fish farming especially in my Constituency of Konoin where there are very many rivers and streams, people in my area are already used to eating fish. If dry land fish farming is introduced in that area, people will have been given a cheap source of protein. They will be able to sell fish to other parts of the country or even export it to other countries. There are many rivers in my constituency and these rivers an can be harnessed to produce hydroelectric power. I think the Authority should liaise with the Ministry of Regional Development in order to carry out the necessary development projects.The Ministry of Energy should be able to provide the necessary personnel to harness these rivers to produce hydro-electricity, I say this because hydro-electricity is cheap to produce and we can	 actually have the whole area electrified - the whole Western region with power that can be generated from rivers within the region.When it comes to the development of hydro-electric power, as one hon. Member has said, land may be required. Land is a very sensitive thing and I third: that the owners of those piece of land that may be acquired for the development of hydro- electric projects should be compensated adequately. They should be given land elsewhere on which to settle before the implementation of the project commences. Any project that is initiated in a given area should involve the local people at all levels: even at the feasibility study level. I say this because when the local people are denied-participation in the implementation of a project in their own area they become hostile and apprehensive to those implementing the project. They may not be co-operative if they are not approached properly. So, they should actually be involved at the grass root level. MR. TERER: (CTD.)When it comes to employing staff, I think the authority- should have attractive terms of service so that it get and retain qualified and competent staff. The authority should also embark on training of personnel, because unless it does this it may not be able to carry out the functions entrusted to it.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, while the LEDA is allowed to invest funds by this Sill, I think such investment should be subject to the approval of the Treasury and the parent Ministry. This is because we have state corporations investing money in dubious finance houses: The KSS invested money in some finance houses that collapsed and thus it lost money. Therefore, the Ministry of Regional Development and the Treasury should be involved in investments by the authority to ensure ¬£ prudent investing.Again, I think this authority should be fully represented in all the district development committees (DDCs).within its region of operation; the authority should even be represented at the dvisional and location levels. Unless we have the authority's representation at such levels, its plans may not take off well: People right from the grassroot level need to be informed so that they know exactly what will happen they also need to get technical advice from the authority's experts as regards the on-going projects.As for borrowing, or dealing with donors, I think we have a problem here that should be looked into very carefully. Sometimes the terms of these loans are very tricky and we need really qualified people to negotiate for the loans. Donors never want to lose money because they do business. Some of the loans and other forms of aid that we received in the past have had stringed attached: we have had people known as technical advisers who must be attached toMR. TERER: (CTD.)the projects who actually take a lot of money back to their countries In fact, it is not a surprise that we say be given a big loan and half of it goes back to loaning country, which is not good for us.Again, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we may not rely on rainfall all the time and I would urge this authority to explore ways and means of even springling water on our farms. Tea does well in Kericho because there is a lot of rain but, since there are certain times when we have dry spells, we would like to have piped water springled or the farms so that, we can continue producing high quality tea.With those few remarks, I beg to support. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE (Mr. Kones): Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for allowing me an opportunity to also contribute to this very important Bill. I feel this fill is overdue: the few districts that have now been, included in the authority should actually have been included in it long before, because they are actually the source of Lake Victoria. We hope the LBDA, which now covers Kericho, will transform agriculture and living styles of people in Kericho, Nandi and other districts that have now come under the authority.As hon. Mibeix said big rivers in Kericho, which run down the hills, cause a lot of soil erosion. In fact, these rivers would have been converted into a useful purpose. The fact that Kericho District has rain all the year round does not mean that every other day there is rain in that district: There times when we de desperately need rain and when we lose a lot of livestock and crops. In such cases we need irrigation for about three months and the rain circle starts again. This authority; which will now cover Kericho and we hope it will be more efficient than it has ever been before shouldTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE (Mr. Kones) (CTD.)transform this country's economy emensely.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have always talked of the Kano Plains floods that are nun caused by the rivers flowing down the Kericho and Nandi hills. We hope that the authority will reduce the water speed in these rivers by blocking up certain parts of the rivers to provide for slow irrigation in the area. Some of the dams we have in Kericho we built in 1952, or even earlier. We hope the authority will now desilt and rejevenate these dams and that we will again get good water for our livestock from these dams, just we used to do in the past.I believe even tea will sometimes need a bit of irrigation and, with a bit of irrigation, I believe that Kericho will, double its current tea production, which will be a big boost to this country's economy. Again, with a bit of irrigation Kericho will have magnificent horticulture which, as we all know, today fetches this country a lot of money.The authority has a duty to make people aware of its plans and programmes. Every hon. Kember from Kericho District has mentioned the Hawawa Hydro Electic Project, which is a very viable one and we need it where it is. But the most unfortunate thing about it is that the public were not made to know what would happen and what their fate would be. Right now there is a lot of speculation that up to 1,000 families might lose their homes completely. This case is different from that of a road passing through people's land where only an acre or two might be taken away. Here we are talking of loss of land by a whole neighbourhood, who will be moved and settled elsewhere, where they will be strangers I for a long time.THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE (Mr. Kones) (CTD.)	As much as we would like to see this project, we urge the authorities concerned to also consider that Kericho residents are going to lose' land. There has been a lot of concentration on the information bit done on the Nyanza side, and this is all because the Authority covers Nyanza Province. These are the effects of this Mawawa thing on the district.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, something must be done and be done urgently. We have always mentioned this in the district development committee and the information we are given is that they are not decided yet. However, whether it is going to take another 10 years, we have no doubt that this project will take off. So, it is important that the authorities concerned should move in and talk to the people, tell them where they will be settled and they will start making plans now. There is no doubt that development will slow down and even schools may even stop developing. Farmers may also stop developing their farms. Whether or not they are evicted now, it means that there will be' a lot of reduction in the development of the area. Therefore, we urge the authorities to move in and assist these desperate farmers who are there waiting to be evicted.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, Kericho being on of the areas covered by the Lake Basin Development Authority, I would suggest that we have a vast land in Kipkelion, which used to be settled by squatters for a long time, to be used for livestock multiplication centre. There could also be other areas set apart for that purposed around Londiani, Bomet and elsewhere because we believe that there will be' a lot of usefulness in the multiplication centres for livestock. This will help farmers very much. There is no doubt that this Authity will do a lot in our district, but the problem now is, as we have heard from hon. Members are beneficiaries of the Athority, that there is no big impact; they do not seem to do what they are supposed to do. They are expected to do quite a bit	 but they are not doing a lot. The worry now is that the area is going to be biggerTHE ASSISTANT M INISTER OF AGRICULTURE (Mr. Kones) (CTD.)and we do not know whether they are going to reduce their efficiency or increase it. We do not know, but what we are urging the Authority to do is that now that they are going to get a bigger and more agricultural, we hope that they are going to be more active than they have been before.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, Nyanza Province has been known so much for fishing around the lake, but not so much as such because there is a bit of rice and cotton farming. Probably the residents of the area do not take farming very seriously. But the residents of Nandi, Kericho, Uasin Gishu and Trans Nzoia districts are serious farmers. If these districts are going to be included in the Lake Basin Development Authority, then it must be seen to be active and not just to have that land as part of its jurisdiction and not doing anything about it. Anything that may not satisfy the farmer in those districts will cause a lot of chaos. So, we urge this Authority to be more vigilant, more active and right with the farmer all the time.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, talking about the fishing industry, most of these other districts which have been added on to this Authority comprise of Kalenjin speaking people who are not very good in eating fish; they are not even good in fishing anyway, leave alone eating the fish. But because the district has been, included within the area of jurisdiction of this Authority, we believe that there are going to be a lot of officers who are going to train the Kalenjins how to fish and how .to eat the fish and the usefulness of fish. Most Kalenjins consider eating fish as being below their dignity. We know that fish is quite good but the residents of this district have not been told what you get from fish. We do not doubt the nutritient value that fish have, but it is just the question of traditional beliefs that Kalenjins do not eat fish. So, we hope that there are going to be a lot of training officers to assist the Kalenjins and Kipsigis people to learn fishing.A lot has been said about the foreign technical officer who are normally attached to the funding that is usually done through state parastatals. It is THE ASSISTANT MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE (Mr. Kones) (CTD.)sometimes annoying to find that a lot of money comes into the' country as aid gets back in terms of wages. If you are' talking of a figure of up to 40 per cent, that is a figure that you cannot really want to imagine because it is very high. We know that these' technicians can be provided within the country. This attachment that the donors are put to their aid is totally unnecessary sometimes because we end up paying these loans for a long time when, in fact, most of the money went back tot he donor country in form of wages. That is why the fellows live so luxuriously. You find a small driver or a small technician who might decide to call himself anything driving a big car and living in a big house's with swimming pools, saunas and whatever else you can imagine. They can afford to be extremely extravagant. Do we need that extravagance really when the money is eventually going to be paid by the Government? I think it is a high time that we monitored these funds very carefully because we end up paying these' loans very expensively because it is always in foreign currency. So, I think we must be able to monitor the situation and where we find that foreign technicians are not necessary we replace them. We cannot accept the strings that foreign donors attach to their money, that they cannot give a donation unless certain technicians are attached to the' fund. We had better say no to this because I do not think it will cost us much.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am saying this because now that the area is going to be enlarged, there are going to be a lot of negotiations and that kind of thing, and a lot of countries will want to move in and look like they are generous to us. But it is going to be very expensive for us.Sir, the last point I wish to make is that when this development move's into other district," I am sure that they are going to build dams. I have no doubt that this Mawawa thing is coming up, and I am sure that they are going to build more dams up the hills to facilitate gravitational irrigation. But there are going to be a lot of mosquitoes and most of the residents of these areas are not used to these insects. If therefore, they are going to be attacked by mosquitoes.THE ASSISTANT MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE (Mr. Kones) (CTD.)there is going to be a big outcry. I am sure that it is not going to be a big problem at the moment, but eventually it will cause a big problem. So, it is good for the Authority to start controlling mosquitoes from the start than waiting until the situation is completely out of control. Of late we have had diseases along the railway line, and the explanation is that mosquitoes down at the lake tend to be transported by trains. We have had some diseases along the railway line which are rather strange. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OKONDO: Thank you Sir for giving me this opportunity. I rise to support the amendment since it is apt because a number of things that are going on in the Lake Basin Development Authority today need change and part of it is provided for in this amendment Bill. A lot more still needs to be done but the Bill is not covering those sections.First of all, I would like to say that the main difficult facing this Authority is that it has forgotten that part of its name called 'development and has become a small time operations organisation. It is now an organization doing only small little things. For example, the lake we refer to as Victoria and which I will prefer to refer to as Lake Nyanza because Victoria was such a terrible imperialist and I do not want to keep thinking about her nor do I want to he reminded of the exploiter of the 19th Century that brought us into this terrible thing has the biggest fish pond you can have in Africa. Now why does this Authority waste its time by developing some little fish ponds natural around the lake when we have a huge natural fish pond? Why should they keep little fish ponds all over and start maintaining them through human forces?You can only see, Sir, that there is lack of imagination because we do not need little things, what we should do is to improve fishing in the lack of the production of all the fish we need. Instead of utilizing the funds its disposal this Authority spends it on little things such as buying mating bulls for some cows. This should be left to individual farmers. Why should a development authority do that kind of thing? They have lost direction. They do not know which way they should go. This amendment ought to draw their attention; the. Ministry should include a clause in this Bill to the effect. That their purpose is to engage in major development projects.We have just heard other examples of what should be done. The Minister should request this Authority to desist from engaging in little things, such as digging water boles for farmers. Farmers can dig water boles and ease.There is another authority know, as Kenfinco dealing with water development. Why does this Authority also double in digging wells and wasting money in this kind of thing? We want them; to think big so that they can produce a huge project. For example, if they have ¬£4 million, they can surely use it to put a big development project in order to attract funds from outside. If they have 14 or 20 little fish ponds, cattle bomas and a few rice fields, who is going to fund that? Nobody wants to fund these little things that do not have any effect on the economy. The Minister should make the Authority realise and understand this.Within that area, we have the Yala River Delta. Hon. Lijoodi said that it roughly covers between 5,000 to 15,000 hectares. The effective area here is over 18,000 hectares. If this Authority were to turn his area into a human settlement scheme, it would be a good thing. Thousands of Kenyans have no land and yet this place is lying idle. If they would turn this area into a settlement scheme for landless wananchi and they say: "Let each family get 10 acres", about 3,000 families would be settled there. Sir, is that a small project? It is a colossal project. If you multiply 3,000 families by five people per family, you got 15,000 people whom this Authority could make live happily. These people could grow; sugar-cane which does well in this region and one or two sugar factories could be established in this area and hence provide employment for the people. That would be development. Rice can also be grown there so that the farmers can feed themselves and since there will be a lot of fish here, the people will have rice, fish and the money. They would be a happy community. This is the type of thing the Authority should have been spending its time on. It should use all the money it has on a thing like this one because it is a major development project which will have an effect	throughout the country. Employment would be created because settlers would come from all over Kenya. Settlement alone would more than pay for the money invested in that place.This Authority must begin to think big and if the management is such that it cannot think big, then let us make it think big. This is becausethe means to make this Authority think big. That is what Ministry should do. If the Act needs to amended to provide for that, the amendment should be brought to this House and we will support it. The amendment at present has only three aspects. I support fully the amendment that the ex-officio members should nominate someone who would to the meetings regularly so that if the P.C. cannot go to every meeting, at least there can be somebody to stand in. That is desirable. That is most welcome.What are we doing to get the Authority tackle the real development issues in the area? I have just mentioned the development of the Yala River Delta: Egypt has a history of 5,000 years with respect to the Nile River Delta for example, how it has been used during the floods, irrigation, development of their culture and so on. Egypt has about 12 to 14 million people settled long the Nile River Delta.It is not bigger than the Yala River Delta. We could do the same by having three or four million people settling in this place. If we could establish two sugar factories in this place and a rice scheme there, we would have a very big agro-industrial complex. In so doing, we would be able to feed the nation and be able to create a lot of employment opportunities for our people.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, having said that, I would like to ask the Ministry to concentrate at least on one project and stop dealing with every little project that comes up. Can you imagine that they also want to grow cashewnuts? This is incredible when you look at what they are doing you just wonder what is wrong with them. This is craziness; when you go there, they tell you that they also want to grow robusta coffee. That is okay, but why do they not grow robusta coffee where there is enough rain? If you went to Uganda today and saw where robusta coffee grows, you would find that the rainfall is four times as much as in western Kenya. You can of course grow robusta coffee through irrigation, but we have see the efforts that are made in growing robusta coffee. A lot of this coffee has now been planted by the Lake Iasin Development Authority and I have had a very keen interest to see them doing it. I am saying this because I lived in Uganda for a long time and I saw what was happening there regarding the growing of robusta coffee. Most of the coffee trees are stunted and they are not as robust as their name seems to suggest. You will find that the size of these trees is the same size an arabica and eyen their stem is smeller. However, you will find that for most of the year, the leaves are yellow or dry since there is not enough water. Therefore, unless there is an irrigation scheme, they cannot grow rebusta in that area profitably. There are only a few places where the rainfall is high and you can grow robusta there, but in in these areas, the population is thick and the people have taken to growing tea which is more profitable.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir this is one of the aspects which the lake Basin Development Authority spends good deal of its time. The next thing which they are wasting a great deal of time on is the production of bulls for the individual formers to buy. In other words they are commercial producer of mating balls. However the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Livestock Development are doing this and there many other farmers who are doing it, Why should Lake Basin Development Authority have to do the same thing? They are wasting a lot of public funds in doing this although they are not efficient enough to do it. I am saying this because they do not have the proper development unit nor do they have enough veterinary officers. They do not have enough staff nor do they have enough skills or technology to do this kind of job, and the most crusial thing that they are lacking, is the dedication to do this. So, why should they waste public money on this? If you try to do business by spreading yourself all ever a very wide area, of course, you will be come very thin and this is what is happening in the Lake Basin Development Authority. I do not want to call it a development authority. I would rather just refer to it as the lake basin business. This is because the kind of development effort that they have TTF made in the 11 years that they have existed is nil as far as I as concerned. I ask anyone what these people have done and they will tell you that these people have done nothing towards development. 'The other Authorities have at least been able to do something of benefit to wananchi, but this particular Authority does not seem to have done anything worthy mentioning.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, could the Minister in his response promise this House that he is going to take sufficient steps to get the Lake Basin Development Authority to concentrate on at least one major project that is of national importance until that project is completed before they can start thinking of repairing motorcar tyres or doing other little things. If they do not want to develop the Yalia River Delta which is in their jurisdiction, they could do something else. They could for instance do a ten-mile strip of irrigation, scheme all the way from Busia to the Moita point.MR. OKONDG (CTD.)That would give us a three‚Äîkilometre irrigated strip all along the lake shore on Kenyan territory. If this is put forward as a project, I do not see how the Authority would miss the necessary money since this is a very viable project. Banks do not lend money to people or institutions, but to projects. If a project is viable, you are likely to get money but, if it is not, no matter how good you are, you cannot get money. I have mentioned two projects which can produce money if they are well presented, but the Lake Basin Development Authority is afraid of this kind of projects. Instead, it just wants to engage in small things that are easy to do claiming that this is because it is not well funded. However, the matter is the other way round. The Authority has not come up with a project that deserves big money. We have asked it many times to tell us what projects it has, and the moment you ask that, the Ministry concerned says, "Wait a bit. We will tell you this later." this is not right. We should be able to produce a project that is worthwhile.The Authority has tampered with electricity generation and mentioned River Mriu and others. </NEWSPEECH>(Hon. Malebe crossed the Floor without bowing to the Chair)<NEWSPEECH>MR. MAKHANU: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is it in order for hon. Malebe to cross the Floor without bowing to the Chair? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwima): Apparently, he has disappeared. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR.

Malebe, you should follow the' right procedure. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MALEBE: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I did not cross the Floor without bowing to the Chair. I just came in and sat down here. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. EKIDOR: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Hon. Malebe cannot get away with this. He crossed the Floor from this point. So, he should go back to the Bar and bow to the Chair. </NEWSPEECH>(Hon. Malebe went back to the Bar, bowed to the Chair and returned to his place)<NEWSPEECH>MR. OKONDO Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, .my plea to the Ministry is that the Lake Basin Development Authority covers an area with a great deal of Kenya's "population. This area is very fertile, and the Authority should now come up with development projects, and not shop‚Äîkeeping projects. To help it, I would suggest that members of its board be organised in such a way I that, at last, each district is represented.MR. OKONDG (CTD.)Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir the Board members should be distributed evenly so that each district in that region has a member on the Board of this organization. I say this because is at present there is a tendency for employment on that Board to be lopsided and this may lead to a lopsided discussion on projects by that Board. Things do not happen as they should happen and things do not go according to what is required.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, if the Lake Basin Development Authority could every now and then also ask the Members of Parliament or councillors or leaders of the area in general, to attend meetings occasionally to discuss development projects in that area that would be a good idea. But the moment you ask them to invite you for a discussion they feel that now here is a Member of Parliament who is trying to undermine us. That is a negative attitude, towards Members of Parliament and the Ministry ought to help us in this respect so that the Authority can do the things it is required to do,Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, you will also find that no matter how well you intend to do something to develop an area	You may want to develop an area out if you cannot visit that area and. see it for yourself, then you cannot develop it. So, one other thing that the L.B.D.A. ought to do is to liaise with the Ministry of Public Works to make sure that there is a good road network in that area. But you never hear these people talking about communications ‚Äì roads to enable them to get to project sites easily. Instead, as one hon. Member has pointed out here, they grow millet and sell it. You see, they themselves become petty little farmers. They become small farmers growing millet to sell.Why should they develop an Authority to grow millet to sell? Old women in the countryside know very well how to grow millet end sell it. What we should do is to make that land available to farmers so that they can grow the millet and even go on and do bigger things So, this is something that I cannot relent on and I am going to repeat it many times. If they want to get sick of it, let them get sick, of it. I am not going to relent on it. That is where they have gone wrong - looking at small projects.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me draw the attention of the minister to the fact that probably one of the faults in that place is that most of the heads of departments in the Authority come from one area. How come? Could the Minister explain that when he rises to reply? Why is it that the heads of departments in the whole Authority come from one area? The Minister should tell us about that. How is the thing organized? What kind of an organisation is this? It is a national organisation which is funded with public money. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Archbishop Ondiek): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, Could hon. Okondo substantiate his allegation that the heads of departments in the L.B.D.A. come from one particular area? That is a very serious allegation. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.OKONDO: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. EKIDOR: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwima): Mr. Okondo is replying to another point of order. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.OKONDO: I have been very clear, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir I said that most of the heads of departments in that Organisation and one area. That is true and I can substantiate it. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwima): I will ask you, hon. Okondo, to substantiate what you have alleged. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. EKIDOR: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwima): what is your point of order, Mr. Ekidor? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. EKIDOR: Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, why is hon. Archbishop Ondiek so sensitive about this matter? Can he declare his interest? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PUBLIC W0RKS (ArichbishopOndiek): It is just a question of putting the records straight, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not think the people Mr. Okondo is talking about come from one particular place. He is making a very unfair statement! </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwima): Hon. Members I am sure that you all aware of the fact that if a Member makes an allegation in this House he must substantiate it fully or withdraw. So, I will request hon. Okondo to substantiate the allegation that the staff of the L.B.D.A. come from one area. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.OKONDO: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwima): Order. Mr. Jalang‚Äôo I have already that hon. Okondo substantiate s or withdraws the remarks. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.OKONDO: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I told you, I will bring the names on Tuesday. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwima): Hon. Members. I agree that we give hon. Okondo time to substantiate his allegation on Tuesday. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.OKONDO: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, that kind of situation is not very pleasant. When the Ministry comes to reply I would like to him to tell us very clearly what action he is taking to get the LBDA concentrate on major projects. It is not that those people cannot do their job they are all very able, knowledgeable and qualified. The question is why their apply their knowledge and ability on trvial things. If you have a. tractor to cultivate a big shamba, why should you use it always to cultivate just one acre? It is difficult for me to know why highly qualified personnel like the LBDA Managing an Director and his departmental heads concentrate on small things. They are supposed to plan for the future, which is the same as predicting the future.We have spoken a lot about the sugar factories in Yale in Siaya District, Busia District and in the Yala Delta. One organisation that can make these projects come true is the LBDA. How, you will see that it does not have anything about these projects in its programmes. Even when they send somebody to the DDO, he is so junior that he cannot say what the authority's budget' and programmes are for this area. If the LBDA did not implement projects in the Yala Delta and irrigation of the Lake shore,they surely, at least, have done the development of fisheries as a major project. But their idea of developing fisheries is to build fish ponds in people's homes. This is utterly ridiculous; there is a whole lake there, which, they could use to develop fisheries and boost our exports. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. MISOI: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is the hon. Member in order to ridicule the development of fish ponds in those areas where dams and other water catchment facilities are not available? Is that is that not development? Is it going backwards? Is it really in order for the hon. Member to speak like that? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OKONDO: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is my opinion and that is the' hon. Member's opinion. He has an opportunity to rise up on this Floor and amke his speech if he catches your eye. If he cannot catch your eye, Sir, he may satisfy himself with raising points of order against my speech. But, at the moment, my worry is that the Lake  Basin Development Authority is spending a lot of money developing fish ponds five or 10 kilometres from the lake shore. What is the point of doing this? Farmers can do it for themselves in their own homes. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. MISOI: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I still maintain that it is not in order for the hon. Member to say that developing fish ponds is not development. If it is not, then what is it? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OKONDO: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, if I go and take leather and make laces for my shoes, that is development, but is it what I should spend national money on? No. I should spend my private funds for making shoe laces. A national organisation is supposed to do something big which benefits the whole community. This is what I am talking about. We now have the international fish market and the Lake Basin Authority has not helped to develop that market. It is individuals who have been exploiting the market through private investments. These are the things I am mentioning and, mark you, Sir, I am not saying that these officers	 </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwima): Mr. Okondo, if I got you right from what Dr. Misoi said, you did not say that development of small fish ponds is not development; you said that it is small development not worthy the Lake Basin Development Authority's care. Otherwise, it is also part of development? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OKONDO: Yes, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I am saying that they are spending too much time on small issues instead of concentrating on the major issues. You have understood me very well; it is the hon. Member who was not understanding me.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, when the Minister for Regional Development comes to reply, he should not dodge this issue; he must reply properly when he responds. Is he going to ensure that in future the Lake Basin Development Authority makes a list of priorities of major projects rather than tiny little' things? Will he tell us that? If he cannot tell us that, then we will have to ask him to go back" to make an amendment to the' Bill to provide for that if he has the facilities to tell the' Authority what to do. These are the things with which I must now come to the conclusion of my speech. I want to ask the Minister, once more', to note that in my opionion, the easiest thing the Lake Basin Development Authority could do would be to harness the River Yala delta. This is the easiest thing of all really because they have already spend some money on it; they have already reclaimed nearly 3,000 hectares. Instead of settling landless wananchi on that 3,000 hectares they have grown millet. Could the' Minister look into this matter and ensure that these 3,000 hectares are given to wananchi in a form of a settlement scheme rather than the Authority engaging itself in millet farming in the place?MR. OKONDO (CTD.) The second Priority is whether they will consider irrigating the strip of land that along the lake. This is very easy to do and to grow the food crops that grow in that region. . There is a very big farm that could be developed in the area to produce a lot food that we need. This is the second priority. The third one, I have mentioned in the development of fisheries in the lake for export purposes so that we can earn foreign exchange instead of leaving it to some individuals, for example, some of there from Tanzania who come to take our fish. The Minister should give us a list of priorities on these things and then we will know the Lake Basin Development Authority (LBDA) in its new form has got to some area that we would like it to go.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, I beg to support. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH> THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwima): Hon. Kirwa </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KIRWA: Thank you, very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity.Just as it has been said by other hon. Members, I strongly believe this authority can only function, if it is going to have a comprehensive programme to cover all the areas that are stipulated in the Bill. Because, It is not just enough to have an authority on paper that is not going to be useful to the area. As it has just been said, we may have a master plan (a programme for the whole area that is involved in this particular authority), but that master plan must be realistic in the sense that it is supposed to look at the MR. KIRWA (CTD.)problems and potentials of various areas as pertains to their unique ecological zones.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, another issue that is quite wanting in the Bill is the issue of membership. This issue includes all the Provincial Commissioners form the areas involved. Rift Valley Province has now got more than three districts, Under the Authority it is sad to note that the Provincial Commissioner of that Province has not been involved. So, if those people can be involved, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are going to be happier than now, because what is there in the Bill is that the old Bill has just been transferred and the amendment that is proposed is not going to be effective, unless all the Provincial Commissioners of the areas involved are covered.The other issue, concerns the membership of the twelve members that His Excellency the President can advise the SO Minister to appoint so as to have some kind of shape or some kind of variety in the area that is involved the 15 districts should have a representative. So that when they sit as survey an authority, they can get all shades of opinions that are going to reflect to the wishes and aspirations of the people involved.The other issue that we feel this Bill .ought to look quite carefully in is about land acquisition. While it is a central aspect, and we all accept it that the Government can acquire land for major development projects, it is vital to- look at both the social and economic issues so that at the end of the day, the people who are going to be displaced, if any, must get adequate compensation in terms of settlement.MR. KIRWA (CTD.)Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am saying this because we do not went to create more squatters in our country because already, this problem is a headache to the Government and a very big social problem. We have seen cases where people are displaced to give way for the establishments of projects these people, although they are compensated, are left without land. As you know, Sir, the value of land appreciates every year and if you were given Shs. 5,000/- as compensation per acre, after two or three months, that money will not buy you an acre of land anywhere in Kenya. So, what we are saying in a nutshell is that if people have to be displaced to give way for development, the Government should as much as possible look for alternative settlement and this should not be done on arbitrary terms. I am saying this because some of the Government officers just sit in their offices and say, "We want 2,000 acres in Cherangani without realising that there may not be even 20 acres of Government land in Cherangani. So, it is important that they should look into this issue because as much as we would like to have development in the area; we want our people to be more peaceful than they are now.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I as happy that this Bill clearly stipulates the areas of study that are supposed to be covered. However what is most important here is that as much as possible, we should encourage the local residents so that any projects that we are going to come up with, is not going to be viewed as a Government project. In other words, people must come, out and identify themselves with those projects; they must see these projects as their own projects and they should not regard them as a while elephant. I am saying this because it is important that the potential of the local resident should be exploited to the utmost extent. This is an issue that we should address ourselves to as we pass this particular Bill.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the officers concerned must also understand the climate, of the area because failure to do that may end up in having to put up a projects that are going to stop half-way through without yielding the necessary results. The officers involved must collect enough information from the field in order to know what kind of climate theyMR. KIRWA (CTD.)are dealing with and the type of problems they are likely to encounter in the course of establishing a certain project. This is an issue that this Authority must address itself to very seriously.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other issue that they ought to really consider is the issue of establishing a programme that is going to generate much income. I am saying this because most of the projects that we have seen coming up tend to give us the impression that Government just pumps money into them and that money just goes into waste, So, the Authority must establish a programme of action which will ensure that any project that is going to be established in any area, is going to be self- sustaining as much as possible. This will assist us to rely less on donations from foreign countries. As we all know, some of the donors just come here to make more money and I yet to believe that there is a donor who is willing to give cat his money just for free. There is always a reason why donors want to give us money, Therefore, the crux of the matter really is that Kenya must at all costs, try to be self-sufficient in order to avoid as much as possible, some of these donor-funded projects. I do not believe that the only way that we can develop, our country is just by getting ‚Äúhand outs‚Äù from abroad, but by establishing income-generating projects and by making sure that we take care of the money we get through such projects.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is also a need for the Government to appraise some of these parastatals so that if some of them are not yielding the expected results, they are done away with. I am saying this because a parastatal should not just be a collection of individuals who have failed to get employment elsewhere or politicians who have failed in politics. The main purpose of establishing these parastatals is to generate income for our people. Therefore, I would like to say that - - - </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwima): Order Mr. Harwa you will continue next time. </NEWSPEECH><HEADER>ADJOURNMENT</HEADER><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwima): Hon.

Members, it is with a heavy heart that I regret to announce the sad news of the death of our friend and colleague, Mr. Ochoia Ogaye MakAnyengo who passed away in the early hours of this morning after a short illness. Born on 13th April, 1931, the late hon. Mak'Anyengo was the Member for Ndhiwa Constituency and also an Assistant Minister for Culture and Social Services. A veteran trade unionist and a renown freedom fighter, hon. Mak'Anyengo was first elected to Parliament in September, 1983 and was immediately appointed as an Assistant Minister for Health. He was transferred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in April, 1986. He was re-elected to Parliament in March, 1988 and was moved to the Ministry of Culture and Social Services as an Assistant Minister a position he has served until the time of his death.For those of us who knew the late hon. Mak'Anyengo, we will always remember him, even though he has physically departed from us. We wi11 miss his humour and debating skills. His contribution to the national development, devotion in serving his constituents and his dedication to ruling party Kanu all speak for themselves. On behalf of us all and on my own behalf, I convey our most heartfelt condolences to the bereaved family, constituents and friends of the late hon. Mak'Anyengo.Hon.

WAKOLE asked the Minister for Health what has delayed the completion of Minijila Health Centre in Tana River District and when it will be completed.<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Dr. B.A Godana): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The completion of Minijila Health Centre has been delayed because the contractor - M/s Ramji Construction Company- abandoned the site. The health centre will be completed as soon as another contractor is appointed through Tana River District Tender Board or when the contractor who was offered the contract resumes his work. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. WAKOLE: I think the assistant Minister has been misled by his officers. The place where the construction is being carried out is very near my house. Although the constructor has been there with his workers there is no work going on due to lack of money from office. Would the Assistant Minister find a proper answer for this? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>Dr. B.A. GODANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the answer I have given is the proper one and perhaps, for the benefit of the hon. Member and others, I may give a few more details.The commencement date of this project was designed to be 2nd June, 1989 and it was expected to end on 2 0th February, 1990,Dr. B.A. GODANA (CTD.) that is within the contract period of 90 days. The contract sum was Kshs. 3 million and the amount already paid to the contractor. Kshs 555, 000/- The percentage of work so far done 16 percent. The Budgetary Estimates for 1988/90 are ¬£20,000 and for 1991 ¬£20,000 again. The contractors abandoned the site in February, this year and has never reported back to work since then. They were issued with default notice on 19th June, 1990 by the District Works Officer, Hola, and another letter asking them to show how they intended to complete the works they have not yet replied.According to the District Works Officer, the contractors are now going to be given another default notice, and if they fail to comply, The contract 	will be terminated without any further notice and. therefore, the work will have to be given to another contractor. </NEWSPEECH>	<NEWSPEECH>MR. WAKOLE: Is the Assistant Minister about that this firm is one of the outstanding contractors, who has built several health centres in Tana River District, and there is no why he could have been defeated by this contract? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. B.A. GODANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not have personal knowledge about the individual contractors but it is my understanding that any contractor who has been approved by the District Tender Board is a good contractor. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE SPEAKER: Next Question, Mr. Makhanu. </NEWSPEECH>Question No .518<HEADER>Payment of Gratuity to Women Workers at Kenyatta National Hospital</HEADER>MR. NDXAI , on behalf of Mr. Makhanu, asked the Minister for Health, why the Board of Management of Kenyatta National 1	Hospital has failed to pay the women employees, who work on contract terms of service, their gratuity benefits for the last three years.<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. B.A. Godana): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.I would like to inform the hon. Member that all expired contracts are serialized as they expire so that payments are made' in an oderly manner. All cases for 1988 approved by the Ministerial Advisory Committee have been paid, but, 36 cases approved by the Ministerial Advisiory Committee worth Ksh .1, 565 , 240 .15 have yet to be paid. Sir, 12 cases for 1990, also approved by the Ministerial Advisiory Committee, worth Kshs.344, 050.20, have not yet been paid. 10 cases for 1987/88 have not yet been paid, but were only approved in July, 1990, by the Ministerial Advisiory Committee.Arrangements are underway to pay the' pending above 58 case's and this exercise should be completed by the end of this financial year 1990/91. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. NDZAI: The Assistant Minister is saying that so many cases have not been settled and that they will be settled may be next year. What is delaying the payments of these people, if they have already worked? Could he tell the House that they will be paid 	as soon as possible? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. B.A GODANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, you will note that the original Question presumed that the Ministry has not been paying gratuity for the last three years but have given a lengthy answer to the effect that only 58 cases out three years have not been settled that is a very small number.Mr. Speaker, Sir, in Kenyatta National Hospital, both men and women serve on contract terms and the management of this contract has been unsatisfactory but, since the beginning of this year measure have been to streamline this area. Expired contracts are now, as I said serialized following the order in which they expire. So,' far all contracts expiring prior to ' December 1988 have alreadv been paid. Those which expired in 1989 are being processed, awaiting availability of funds.In the 1988/89 financial year, the grant to Kenyatta National Hospital from the Treasury, was reduced by about an amount of Kshs.22 million and this partly accounted for our failure to pay these few pending cases. But, as I said, we intend to pay them all by the end of this financial year, which is only about eight months away. </NEWSPEECH>Question No. 547<HEADER>Number of Unemployed Ex-AHITI Graduates</HEADER><NEWSPEECH>MR.

MWAMZANDI asked the Minister for Education(a) How much money has been set aside for the maintenance of the buildings of JomoKenyattaa Memorial Primary School, Msambweni, Division, during the current financial year, that is, 1990/91, and(b) When were these buildings last renovated.<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Karauri): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Because of financial constraints, my Ministry has not yet set aside funds for the maintenance of the buildings of Jomo Kenyatta Memorial Primary School during the current financial year, 19-90/91. This is a day maintained primary school, and hence, the School Committee and the School Community have a noble responsibility of maintaining the buildings.(b) The school buildings have not been 'renovated since this school was built in 1979 in memory of the late President MzeeJomo Kenyatta. However, the buildings are in a fairly good condition. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MWANZANDI: Arising from the Assistant Ministers reply, that nothing has been set aside during this year 1990/91 and realizing the fact that the school was built in honour of the ( late President for the good work}he	done for the Nation. IS it fair for the Ministry of Education after spending so much money good buildings, just to leave the MR. MWANZANDI (CTD.)buildings in that state without any Government maintenance in the hands of the poor people who are not in a position to maintain them? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KARAURI: Mr. Speaker, Sir. I expected the hon. Member to thank the Ministry for constructing this school. It is up to him and the local community to do the: rest including maintaining the buildings. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MWAMZANDI: The school was build in honour of the late President. Was it just to be built and left like that? Any memorial institute should be taken care of by the Government itself? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KARAURI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as far as I know the school is in a fairly good condition. It is, therefore, up to the hon. Member to conduct a Harambee in that area, so that he can improve whatever he thinks is not proper. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, Harambee funds drives are being held, and this is a memorial, school in honour of the late President. In order to maintain the good name of the late President, the Government should, through the Ministry of Public Works, maintain these buildings rather than lease them to other people who might not be able to keep them up to standard. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KARAURI: I have already answered that question, Mr. Speaker, Sir. </NEWSPEECH>Question No- 469<HEADER>Refund of Late Dzombo's Co-operative Shares</HEADER>MR. BIDU asked the Minister for Co-operative Development what is delaying the payment of the co-operative shares to the family of the late Mr. Ali Dzuha Dzombo, membership No. 11683, Alisi Co-operative Savings and Credit Society, since his death on 25th . November - 1989.<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CO-OPERATIVE DEVELOPPMENT (Mr. Ejore):Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The share contribution of the late Ali Dzuha Dzanbo, member No .11683 in a savings and credit co-operative society, will be refunded to the nominee as soon as the famility concerned has submitted the original death certificate for verification to the insurance company concerned. At his death, on 25th November, 1989, Mr. Dzombo had saved a sum of Shs.l2,500/= with a savings and credit co-operative society and had an outstanding loan balance of Shs.25,625/=. The society has insured all the members' savings and loans with the Co-operative Insurance Services Ltd. The family of the late Dzombo applied for a refund of his share contribution thro ugh the Mombasa Branch of the society, the application was received by the society's headquarters on 25th April, 1990 and approved by the central management committee on 30th July, 1990 for transimission to the Co-operative Insurance Services Ltd. for settlement. However; the Co-operative Insurance Services Ltd. requires production of the original death certificate before a death claim is settled. This requirement has been communicated to the bereaved family, but it has not been complied with. A reminder has already been sent to the family, which should be prevailed upon to produce the original death .certificate in order to facilitate the payment of the death claim by the Co-operative Insurance Services Ltd. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, either the Assistant Minister has been misled by his officers or he is .misleading this House. The original death certificate .in this case was forwarded, and I am surprised that the Assistant. Minister refutes this. I have a copy of the certificate in question. I do not know whether the Assistant Minister obtained his information from the co-operative society in question or not. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. EJORE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not misleading the House. Perhaps, it is the hon. Member who is doing so. I tried to ask our officers in the field whether the death certificate of the late Mr. Dzombo was sent to the management committee concerned, and they said that no such certificate has been forwarded there. So, the hon. Member had better check his information. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe that the Assistant Minister has understood this Question. The original death certificate in question was forwarded. I formed my Question from the original certificate. Could he do further investigations into the matter? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. EJORE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the hon. Member has the original death certificate of the deceased, this is different, but we do not have in our files. However, I promise the hon. Member that I will check this information further with my officers. </NEWSPEECH>Question No. 500<HEADER>Repair of Roads in Spark and Chaani Areas</HEADER>MR. KILIKU asked the Minister for Local Government what steps the Ministry is taking to ensure that roads in Spark and Chaani areas of Changamwe Constituency are repaired forthwith.<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. Wagura): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The Minister has given approval to Mombasa Municipal Council to spend over Shs.4, 869, 080/- in recarpeting the roads in Spark area during the on-going Phase II project. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Question talks about Spark and Chaani areas. Could the Assistant Minister now tell us about Chaani area? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. WAGURA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the roads in Chaani will be repaired when funds are made available. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKU: Could the Assistant Minister tell us what action the ministry is taking to make funds available for this work arid how much will spent? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. WAGURA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, funds will be made available when Mombasa Municipal Council collects more funds in the form of service charges. Thereafter, we will repair these roads. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKU: Could the Assistant Minister tell us what he means by saying that Mombasa Municipal Council should collect more funds in the form of service charges? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. WAGURA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, could the hon. Member repeat his question? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister says that these roads will be repaired when Mombasa Municipal Council will collect more funds in the form of service charges. Could he tell us what he means by this? I am talking about the roads in Chaani. How much money will be spent in reparing these roads? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. WAGURA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the repair of these roads will cost about Shs.500, 000/-. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister has said that his Ministry has given approval to Mombasa Municipal Council to spend Shs.4 million. Could he specifically tell this House as to when the said Council will start repairing the roads in question? All that the Ministry has done is to approve this expenditure, but I am asking about the recarpeting of the roads in the areas I have mentioned. When will this work be done? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. WAGURA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the necessary funds are already available, and Crescent Construction Company Ltd. has already been awarded this contract. So, this work will start immediately. In fact, for the interest of the hon. Member, the roads to be repaired are Swara Guru Road (?), Wajir Road, Koinange Road and Baringo Road. A contractor is already on site. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the hon. Questioner asked a veryMR. BIDU (CTD.)vivid question, and the Assistant Minister should know that when he says that this work will start immediately, this means that it could start any time now. The hon. Questioner, however, wants to know specifically when the work will begin.MR. WAGURA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the word "immediately" means immediately. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know agree with the Assistant Minister that these roads will be repaired immediately, but I would like to get guidance from the Chair as to what action the Ministry will take if these roads are not repaired by the time I go down to Mombasa next time. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. WAGURA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would have thought that the hon. Member would be grateful for the answer I have given him. All I am saying is that we already have a contractor for the job and money is available. So, I do not understand why the hon. Member wants to raise an argument out of nothing. The said contractor has already signed the contract and taken machinery to the site, and his money is available. This work will start immediately. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir, What does the Assistant Minister mean when he says that this will "be done "immediately"? Is the Assistant Minister not misleading this house? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. WAGURA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not misleading the House. This is because one does not mislead the House when he tells the truth, I am saying that the contractor has moved to the site. The money is there and I will not be surprised if the work starts this week. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Can we go back to hon. Chepkok‚Äôs Question? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MRS.NITDETEI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. In the past hon. Members have been promised in this house that certain things will be done either "as soon as possible" or as soon as the money is available" or "immediately". The Minister and Assistant Ministers have managed to get away with those words. Hon. Kiliku has asked a specific question. If there is money and the contractor is on site and we have also heard that contractor abscond when they are taken to site can the Assistant Minister tell this House when the work will commence? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. WAGURA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the work will commence next week. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I was not asking about the whereabouts of the contractor. I was asking when these roads will be re-carpeted. But the Assistant Minister is telling me about the whereabouts - of the contractor, </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. WAGURA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have said that the work will start this week. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Let us go back to hon. Chepkok's Question. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.

KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Could hon. Mwamzandi apologise to the House for coming in late? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think hon. Kiliku is not stable today. This is because when hon. Wagura said that "work will start this.wee" hon. Kiliku did not hear him and when I was apologising hon. Kiliku did not hear me.' I think he should try to concentrate on what is going in the Chamber. I have already apologised to the House. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.

MWAMZANDI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Minister says that the dependants have already been paid. But the truth of the matter is that they have not received that cheque Could the Minister tell us where the cheque is? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. NYAGAH: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member knows where to go and look for the cheque. He can trace the cheque from the Principal Pensions Officer's office, Treasury, to the District Commissioner, Elgeyo Marakwet. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while thanking the Minister for that reply, could he tell this House whether that cheque was sent by register or ordinary mail? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.

Why can the Ministry not write another cheque and send it to the said dependants? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.

NDZAI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, before asking this Question on behalf of Dr. Misoi, I would like to apologise for not being here when the Question was called for the first time. </NEWSPEECH>Question No.547<HEADER>Number of Unemployed Ex-AHITI Graduates</HEADER>MR. NDZAI, on behalf of Dr. Misoi, asked the Minister for Livestock Development :-(a) how many trained Extension Officers (Ex- AHITI Graduates); Livestock and Veterinary Officers were unemployed as at 30th September, 1990; and(b) how the Ministry intends to utilise this trained manpower in the National Development to avoid creating trained unemployment professionals.<NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Nyagah) : Mr- Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.With regard to part (a) of the Question, I do not know the numbers. However, the Ministry knows the numbers of those who graduate from these educational and training institutions and those seeking employment in the Civil Service at the end of each academic year.Subject to financial provisions allowed by this House to the Ministry of Livestock Development and subject to the number of places allowed by the Director of Personnel Management, the Ministry usually takes the required numbers into employment and then deploys them to man the districts, divisions and even the locations. THE MINISTER FOR LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT (CTD.); Mr. Speaker, Sir, active discussions and consultations within the Ministry, the Directorate of Personnel Management and the Treasury are currently taking place and as soon as the final decision is reached those who graduated from those institutions in 1988, 1989 and 1990 will be taken into relevant employment positions within the Ministry. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>ME. SPEAKER: Hon. Malebe. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MALEBE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Minister says that he does not know the number of trained extension officers who were unemployed as at 30th September, 1990. Does he know the number of these trained officers who were' employed by his Ministry by that time since A.H.I.T.I., which falls under his Ministry, is upposed to plan for the training of extension officers so that they go and man his field units in sub-locations and even in villages? Can he explain to the House whether he is really training these officers without planning where they will go after training? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. NYAGAH: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I cannot quite get .the question being asked by the hon. Member. First of all, he says that I said I did not know. I said that I do not know the numbers as far as the Question is put on the Order Paper. But I did also confess that the Ministry knows the numbers that leave at the end of each academic year. I need not respond to the other question of those extension officers who are employed since the question does not arise here. However, I took notice of the question of those unemployed extension officers. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MALEBE: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is the Minister in order to tell the House that he does not know what to do with trainees being handled by his Ministry? Although he says here that he does not know, he knows the number of those who graduated. By the same token, he should also know the number of trained extension officers who have been employed by his Ministry even if he does not want to know the number of those who have been employed by other institutions. By plus and minus, he should be able to tell us the number of those who are unemployed. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. NYAGAH: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I said in the beginning, the Question seeks the information as to how many trained extension officers were unemployed as at 30th September, 1990. Since the institutions under A.H.I.T.I. were established, they have trained very many extension officers and some of them are doing private work and others are employed while others are nowhere to be seen. I did, however, say that at the end of every academic year the Ministry knows how many officers of each category have tried to seek employment within the Government service and are employed or unemployed. I can give that number. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. NDZAI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Minister has no reply to this Question. If he does not know the reply to part (a), then he cannot answer part (b). That being the case, could he go back and do more research and bring a proper answer to this House? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. NYAGAH: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the House would wish me to answer a question that has not been answered, then I will do that. Although we do not know what the hon. Member is asking, we do know the number of trainees that leave' our institutions at the end of each academic year and I will give the numbers if the House so wishes. May I do that, Sir? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>HON. MEMBERS: Endelea! Endelea! </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. NYAGAH: Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are 1,778 officers in all categories with certificates, diplomas and degrees who finished their training during the year 1988/89. Of these, 15 were veterinarians, 330 we're range management and animal production officers, 298 hold diplomas from Egerton University, 780 hold certificates from Nyahururu, Kabete and Ndomba and 220 hold certificates in the various categories of dairy technology, range management, animal health, hide's and skins. We also have 220 from A.H.I.T.I. and Naivasha. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. NDZAI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, in view of the fact that the Minister has given the number of those who were trained during 1988/89, how many of those were employed as at 30th September, 1990, and how many were not employed as at that date? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. NYAGAH: Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to my original answer, I said that currently discussions are going on between the Directorate of Personnel Management, the Treasury and the Ministry of Livestock Development to see how many trainees can be employed by the Government, within the finances made available by this House. I am sorry to say that the reason why these discussions are .being held is that the House did not provide for these trainees in the last financial year. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MALEBE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, could the Minister give us a detailed reply to part (b) of the Question? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. NYAGAH: Mr. Speaker, Sir, once a person qualifies by holding a certificate, a diploma or a degree in veterinary, animal production or animal health and is absorbed in the Civil Service, he is posted to either the headquarters, the province, the district, the division or the location. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Next Question. </NEWSPEECH>Question No. 532<HEADER>.... Provision of Electricity to Taveta Residents</HEADER>		MR. KILIKU, on behalf of Mr. Kubo, asked the Minister for Energy what is delaying the connection of electricity to individual consumers who have' already paid connection charges to K.P. & L. Co. Ltd. in Taveta Constituency.<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Mr. M'Mukindia): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The delay is related to the pace at which the consumers pay for their connection charges and undertake satisfactory internal wiring of their buildings. Some consumers pay immediately after the contractor has passed the site and have' to wait for the contractor to come back in the project area. Other consumers pay but fail to complete internal wiring of their buildings, without which the connections would be dangerous to make. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Speaker, could the Assistant Minister briefly tell the House when the consumers who have already applied will be connected with power supply? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. M'MUKINDIA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, could the' hon. Member repeat his question? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I expect the Assistant Minister to listen and take the House seriously. We are not in a classroom in Meru. Could he' tell the House when electricity connection will be done for-those who have already applied and paid for the services? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. M‚ÄôMUKINDIA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, currently, in the project area, we have 84 consumers who are in the waiting list but who have only paid token amounts which are not enough to meet the cost of supplying electricity to their premises. Therefore, at the moment we are not able to supply because the consumers have not met the full cost. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MALEEE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister tell the House whether transformers have been installed in the appropriate sites to enable these consumers be connected with power without technical hitches? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. M'MUKINDIA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, every time we supply electricity to any given area, we try to serve as many people as possible. We, therefore, locate transformers in areas where we are certain of getting maximum numbers of consumers. Just to illustrate, in the project area, which covers Bura, Mwakitau and Taveta Township, we have 25 service lines in Bura, 20 in Mwakitau and 170 in Taveta Township. This project is part of the giant Mwatate-Taveta-Loitokitok line and will be picking up market centres along and supplying them with power.As of now, within Bura itself, we do have 45 consumers already supplied with electricity, 15 consumers within Mwakitau market and 246 consumers within Taveta market. Therefore, we locate transformers in areas where we expect the highest Number of consumers. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>NDZAI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 2 Assistant Minister says that the consumers do not EX. pay enough money. Could he tell the House how much each consumer is supposed to pay? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MINUKINDIA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the consumers who have already applied has paid and those who are still on the waiting list are 84 and the amount depends entirely on the exact location of each premise in relation to the transformer. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.

Speaker: We shall now move on to Questions by Private Notice. </NEWSPEECH>QUESTIONS BY PRIVATE- NOTICE<HEADER> provision of KEKROM to all Hospitals</HEADER><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Health the following Question by Private Notice:- Since the spread, of A.I.D.S. has continued to increase at an alarming rate, what urgent steps the Minister is taking to ensure that "KEMRON' is readily available in all district and provincial hospitals in the Republic. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Dr. Godana): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The Ministry of Health strategy is to continue the campaign against I A.I.D.S. through the National A.I.D.S Committee which is actively educating and informing Kenyans about the preventive measures against the spread of A.I.D.S. Kemron is a drug which is still under study, since its launching in July, 1990. More information and 2 facts about its role in the management, of A.I.D.S. is clinically confirmed in multi-centres and multi-disciplinary studies involving many doctors of different sub-professional groups which has been planned by the Ministry of Health provincial and referal hospitals. Kemron is a research drug which needs to be given time for doctors to study it and acquaint themselves with the side effects </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while thanking the Assistant Minister for his reply, is he aware that after Kenya discovered this drug Kemron, we have heard a lot of stories about another drug called Kemron in. United States of America? Can he confirm or deny that the same drug is being manufactured in America. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. GODANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the drug Kemron is only one whether it is available here or in the United States. I am sure hon. Members do know that the drug was developed through research involving several collaborators including Hayashibara Biochemical Laboratories of Japan- and the Ameriro Sale Culture of Texas, U.S.A. These are the manufacturers who hold international rights for its distribution. Therefore, the drug being referred to as Kemron whether available here or outside is still one and the same drug. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MRS. NDETEI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, since Kemron has been so much publicized both national and internationally, I understand there-are a lot of AIDS patients who are coming here for treatment. Does the Ministry not consider this √Ø to be dangerous in the sense that if we have more A.I.D.S. patients coming into Kenya, we stand a bigger risk of having more of our people getting infected? . Would the Ministry ensure .that this .drug is circulated adequately both nationally and internationally. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. GODANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government does not encourage any group of people from outside to come and get treatment for A.I.D.S. here. If anything, we are concerned about raising the awareness of our own people to limit in all possible ways, the spread of this deadly disease. As I said, the agencies in the distribution of the drug, are actually trying to make it available 2 everywhere. However, the drug cannot at the moment be bought over the counter since it is still under study. However, I would like to assure the hon. Member and the house that we shall do everything possible to minimize the spread of A.I.D.S. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MALEGZ: Mr. Speaker, Sir, there was an article in the newspapers last week saying that there is an increase of A.I.D.S. cases in Kenya to the tune of 9,000 patients, when this drug was discovered, the whole country was promised that this drug would be supplied in hospitals throughout Kenya so that we can reduce the. Spread of the disease. however, the Assistant Minister now comes here and says that this drug Kemron is still being studied and that until the research is complete, the drug cannot be made available in Kenya, Why did the Ministry, in the first place, promise the country that this drug would be made available in hospitals ' to reduce the spread of A.I.D.S. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. GODANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think hon. Members took a very layman's view of the announcement that was made by the Ministry at the very beginning. As I said in my main answer, more information and facts about the role of Kemnron in the management of the disease, is being gathered through studies conducted on a multi-disciplinary basis by the Ministry through provincial and a number of referal hospitals. This means that although this drug is there in these hospitals, they are not available for distribution at each and every health centre and dispensary until doctors are able to study the effect of this drug on patients, lie cannot therefore make any promise that this drug will be available at every medical counterin the country because as hon. Members know, not all people who mann all? Medical of these/institutions are actually qualified doctors to follow the required instructions about the drug. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Next Question! </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>Mr. MALEBE: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister not confusing the house here? I am asking this because if there are referal hospitals where this drug is available, why does the Ministry not make a daylight announcement saying that we have Kemron in this or that hospital? we do not expect this drug to x be all over in every dispensary or health centre but </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>ME.SPEAKER: what is your point of order, Mr. Malebe? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MALEBE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the Assistant Minister really in by saying order to confuse the house by saying that this drag is available for test in referal in hospitals while in an earlier announcement issued by the Ministry clearly said that the drug would be made available in major hospitals throughout the country </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. In view of the seriousness of this disease in that we have in Kenya 9000 people suffering from it, would it not be in order for the Minister to issue a Ministerial Statement informing Kenyans that this Kemron is no longer there? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR.GODANA: It seems the hon. Members rare taking this matter very lightly. I think it is a pity because hon. Members should know that under a statute of this Souse - The Pharmacy and Poisons Act - the safety of drugs must be assured before they are consumed. We are not at a stage where we can avail this drug to every patient who would like it to be tried on him. hon. Members must understand that we all have a responsibility to the nation not to give false promises because the effects could be disastrous. I have already said that the Ministry is seriously engaged in research to establish the efficacy of this drug. I think we need a lot of understanding particularly from opinion leaders like the hon. Members. Tie cannot tell the people that the drug is not there because we are actually investigating its suitability. We cannot also make it available to every Tom, Dick and Harry at every spot because the consequences could be great. This is the kind of attitude that has been confusing seem wananchi and they have relaxed their moral behaviours simply because Kemron is available. We need a lot of understanding from the hon. Members on this mater. Termination of Services: Messrs Ndolo and Muthike </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MRS NDETEI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Public Works the following Question by Private Notice:In view of the fact that the Minister promised that Messrs Philip Ndolo and Muthike, who were working with the Rural Access Roads Programme in Machakos District, would not be victimised as a result of issues raised under Question No. 642 of 19S9j why did the Ministry, then, terminate their services? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Is there somebody from the Ministry of Public Works to respond to this Question? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MRS. NDETEI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir When this Question was asked last year.hon. Biwott answered on behalf of the Minister of Public works. Mow that hon. Biwott is in the House. I would like him to respond to this Question. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Mr. Biwott): Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the basis of collective responsibility, I beg to reply on behalf of the Minister for public Works.Messrs Philip Ndolo and Muthike were never victimised as a result of issues raised under Parliamentary Question Kb. 642 of 1989. My Ministry had to terminate services of some casual workers due to reduced workload within Programme rural Access Roads programme in Machakos District. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MRS.NDETEI: Sir, While I thank the Minister for taking pains to answer my Question, I clearly remember when I asked, this Question in March this near the hon. Minister promised that these people were not going to victimised. I had suspected that these people were going to be victimized because I had raised this Question in this house. It is common practice in the Civil Service to the effect that if a Question is asked in this House about 2 civil servant, the nest thing you hear is that he has been transferred or something has happened to him. Since these people do not have trade unions to defend them, the rely on their Members of Parliament to take up their issues, immediately that Question was raised here, these people lost their jobs; they are not even finish that week on the job. Surprisingly, three new people were brought in to do the very job Messrs Ndolo and Muthike were doing. This was not actually a redundancy exercise which led to lying off workers since there is adequate prove that other people were brought to perform the same job. Since the Minister has told us that these People had to be reduced which means that they were never even compensated by being given time off as promised in "he earlier reply, can he now agree to pay them cash benefits for loss of employment and particularly their of overtime? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.BIWOTT: Mr. Speaker. Sir, I do not think that the hon. Lady means that the Minister can victimise somebody. All of us know hon. Mibei as a Minister who cannot victimise anybody. Because of that, I would like to appeal to the hon. Member to accept the fact that this was a genuine lay off exercise which normally happens with casual workers. I, however, feel that should there be any vacancy - casual or otherwise - those who were laid off would be considered first. As for cash payments, I do not think that casual workers are entitled to any cash payments since they are only paid for services rendered at a given time, say, on ka hourly basis or shared measures. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MRS. NDETEI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, when I raised this issue here last time. I proved in this House that Messrs Ndolo and Muthike had been given appointment letters which said that they would be working for eight hours a day. But the practice on site was that they were working for 12 hours every day; they were not resting on public holidays nor on weekends. They were working for 12 hours a day seven days a week. I am not asking for the reinstatement of these people nor am I asking for future employment for them but for the payment of accumulated overtime as at the time when they were employed. That is all I am asking for. This is a fact and their payment can be calculated according to the available records. I would like to be assured that they will be paid because they were never compensated by being given time off as promised in the .previous reply a copy of which I have with me. I want them to be paid in cash. Can the Minister agree that I come to his office tomorrow and we do the necessary calculations? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIWOTT: Mr. Speaker, Sir, anybody who is familiar with casual work, knows that casual workers are not entitled to many privileges unless specified otherwise. If there is such specification and there is a letter to that effect, the Ministry would definitely honor it. But in this particular case, I would, in fact, urge the hon. Member to go and see theMinister responsible and discuss the matter with him in order to get a more satisfying answer. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MRS.NDETEI: Kr. Speaker, Sir. I have already seen I he Minister for Public Works on this matter but he does not seem to be helping me. When the services of these people were terminated, I asked him whether he was going to pay or reinstate them but he has been quiet. I agree that Ministers do not victimise others but their officers in the field are victimising other Government workers. This is a classic case and I am not asking for side benefits but for something that was promised to these workers in writing. It is indicate in the schedule I have that they will only work For eight hours a day and any excess time worked would be paid for as overtime. That is all I it am asking for. If the Minister agrees that since is specified in writing that they will be paid overtime, I will come for the - money if he promises to release it. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIWOTT: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think there could have been a great error of judgement. The letter seems to have specified the actual working time, that is, eight hours and that extra hours worked would be paid for at a certain rate. But there is no evidence to the effect that on the material period, these people were actually told to extend working hours in order to earn extra money. It is possible that these casual workers went out of their way - being true nationalists - and worked extra hours in the hope that they would be paid. In such a case, it would be difficult for anybody to justify their claim except to acknowledge and commend those who did the job.In order for the hon. Lady to get to the bottom of this matter, I would still urge not gas to give up but to go to the Ministry and get proper explanation with regard to this case as per the days in question! She should, preferably, go with the casual workers in question, so that this matter can be solved amicably. I think that would be much more satisfactory. </NEWSPEECH><HEADER>Terms of Employment: Hilowle Mohamed</HEADER>(MR.

KINYAJUI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ash the Minister for Environment and Natural Resources the following Question by Private Notice.What steps is the Minister taking to protect the people of Gitaru from the harmful dust from the nearby Kabete Rironi Road? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL (Mr. K'Ombundo): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Since the attention of my Ministry was attention to the problem of harmful dust at Gitaru, the relavant Ministries, namely Health Public Works and Industry, with legal instruments were requested to take immediate measures to eliminate the harmful dust from the crusher and quarry. The Ministry of Public Work's agreement with the road contractor has very clear conditions on safety and public health requirements, which must be adhered to.Thank you, Sir. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>Mr. P.K. KENYANJUI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while appreciating the Assistant Minister's good reply, the people, livestock area and plants of the affected suffering right now. Would the Assistant Minister, therefore, convene a meeting of the Ministries of Health, Public Works and labour, and agree on the measures to be taken so that in the crushing of the stones can be done elsewhere as it is done in other cases. Could the Assistant Minister assure us that he will convene such a meeting and institute measures to rectify the situation? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. K'OMBUNDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I said earlier, ay Ministry has alerted the various -Ministries with legal instruments to invoke the same in order to abate this nuisance. In fact, we also wrote to the Ministries concerned on 26th October, 1990, and I think the solution to the problem will soon be forthcoming. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. A.K. KINYAKJTJI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, hon. P.K. Kenyanjui has very rightly asked the Assistant Minister to convene a meeting of the Ministries he is referring to as a matter of urgency because his Ministry is in charge of environment. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. K'OMBUNDO: Sir. Speaker, Sir, as you know, we are very much concerned about the welfare of wananchi. As such I do not think that we would resist the convening of such a meeting: We will certainly SEX convene it. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. P.K. KINYANJUI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, even though the Assistant Minister has already taken the right action by writing and informing the Ministries concerned of the problem, we are all familiar with how these things are done and so writing is not enough. That is why we are suggesting that it is necessary to convene a meeting of the Ministries concerned and agree on the action to be taken in order to alleviate this problem. The contractor must be told to go and crush the stones away from the people. Will the Assistant Minister ensure that action is taken immediately, otherwise people will die? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Mr. Kiliku's Question. </NEWSPEECH><HEADER>Non-Payment of Overtime to N.C.P.B. Workers in Changamwe. </HEADER><NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Supplies and Marketing the following Question by Private Notice.Why have the Changamwe and Shimanzi depots of the National Cereals and Produce Board not been paying over-time allowances to the employees who work on Saturdays and Sundays? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. Mwenje): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The employees of the National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) are paid overtime allowance for any work done after the stipulated eight hours working day that is after 5 pm and also for any work done a on Saturdays and Sundays. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, these workers in Changamwe and Shimanzi have been working during the weekend and, I think ,they are entitled to overtime allowances for the hours worked after noon on Saturdays and on Sundays. Will the Assistant Minister tell the House why the Board has not been paying these workers the overtime allowance? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MWENJE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have just said that they have been paid for any hours worked after noon on Saturdays and Sundays. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister is telling us these workers have been paid and the hon. Member for the area is telling us that the workers have not been paid. We do not know whether it is the Assistant Minister or the hon. Member who is misleading the ¬£ House. What has the Assistant Minister done to establish the truth? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MWENJE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the whole truth is that the workers have been paid. All the overtime allowanceshave been paid except those for March to June, 1990, which are being processed now: Were was a short delay in processing allowances for these months caused by audit work which had been going one. I can assure the hon. Member these allowances which are being processed will be pa.id before the end of this month. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR, MWAMZANDI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Do you not agree with me that the Assistant Minister has been using the time of the Mouse unreasonably? If there are allowances which are being processed, why does he not agree that the workers r. have not been paid and that their allowances are being processed? Why should not on talking in circles and making it appear as if hon. kiliku is misleading the House? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MVENJE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is nothing in what I have said that is misleading. The Question is on why the Board has not been paying overtime allowances, which is not the position: It has paid alls, allowances except for those of this particular season, which will be WITH thin this month. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to ask hon. Mwenje not to try to be funny. The workers whose allowances he says are being processed have not been paid since October, 1969. Could he tell the House when these workers will be paid? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MVENJE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is not correct, in the first place. There is no unpaid overtime allowance for last year. The only allowances being processed are for March to me, 1990 whose payment was delayed by audit work at the Board's Headquarters here in Nairobi. And I have said clearly that even the allowances being processed will be paid before the end of this month </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the Assistant Minister tell the House why the overtime payments are not made alongside the salaries? Why should the overtime element have any delays? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MWENJE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the answer is obvious. Overtime payments cannot be made together with the salaries. They have to be made differently as they fall due at different times. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think hon. Mwenje represents workers who earn overtime in his Embakasi Constituency. If he states here that overtime payments cannot be made together with the salaries, he is going to answer question in Embakasi one day. Could he ensure that these workers are paid their overtime as it is for work they have already done? The Assistant Minister should not encourage that establishment to delay such vital payments to the workers. If the money has been worked for in terms of overtime, then the payments should be made immediately. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MWENJE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would, first of all like to put it right that it is not hon. Mwenje personally replying to this Question but that it is the Ministry's response. The .question of overtime has to be calculated on the hours worked, unlike the salary which is a fixed figure. At times, you even find that some workers work on Sundays and are; thus, paid higher rates. So, you cannot apply the same consideration .for the salary. So, there is no delay here as overtime has always been paid as it became due. The only payment that was delayed was this particular one because there was an audit exercise that was going on in the company. Now that the exercise is over, the processing of the payments is in progress and the whole issue will be completed before the end of this month. It is now for hon. Kiliku to advise the people concerned that they will get their dues before the end of this month.Fishing Ban by Use of "Gogo" nets </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OKONDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Regional Development the following Question by Private Notice.(a) Could the Minister confirm that he has not banned fishing by means of "Gogo" nets in lake Victoria?(b) What conservation measures is the Minister taking to protect and improve fishing and to conserve fish for the future generations? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Midika): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The Hon. Member for Bunyala has asked a good Question and I would > like to inform him that I had, myself, predicted that if we allowed certain nets to be used, it would result in the death and total depletion of fish in Lake Victoria. Therefore, the hon. Member failed to predict the death of this fish. If we used the wrong nets, like the beach seams(?), those are nets that resemble mosquito nets, we will fish out all the fish including the eggs and, therefore, in my predicting the death of all the fish in Lake Victoria, I respectively banned the use of the wrong nets and the use of trawlers in order to ensure that the ecology in the Lake is not also disturbed. The hon. Member, himself, is aware, having lived in that area, that if we fish out everything and we do not predict the future of the fish, we will lose everything and that is very dangerous. Most of hon. Okondo's voters are fishermen and it is always better to predict what will help them in future. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OKONDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the issue is not whether the fishing net is small or large but whether the Minister has banned sea nets. If he has done so, he should tell the House so. If he has only banned a given size of nets, he should say so, too. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MIDIKA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like the hon. Member- to lend me his ears so that I can give him a complete answer which will repeat exactly what I have been saying. I have banned beach sea nets. These are the nets that look like mosquito nets. I have not banned "Gogo" nets. You know hon. Okondo is a luo half-way. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MANG'OLI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is it in order for the hon. Minister to use a language we do not understand in the House? Is the Luo language allowed in the House? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>HON. MEMBERS: It is allowed. The word is quoted in the Question. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MIDIKA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if hon. Mang'oli has read the Question at all, it seeks to know whether the "Minister could confirm that he has not banned the fishing by means of "Gogo" nets. That is international language. I said I had not banned fishing by "Gogo" nets. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MWAMZANDI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Could hon. Mang'oli apologise for insinuating that the Minister was speaking in Dholuo while we all know he was speaking in English? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MANG'OLI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am wondering whether hon. Mwamzandi heard what hon. Midika said. If "Gogo" is surely an English word, can we be given the definition then? Can hon. Mwamzandi himself define "Gogo" if it is an English name? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MIDIKA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not know what we could call Mang'oli in English.(laughter)I say so because "Gogo" is a name. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MANG'OLI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the Minister not continuing to mislead the House by not clarifying what "gogo" means and by saying that "Mang'oli" is in English? Is he in order to do this? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MIDIKA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, "gogo" is a name just like Midika, Kibaki and Mang'oli are. Even Webuye and Muhoroni are proper names.I would like to say that I have not banned the use of "gogo" nets in Lale Victoria; I have only effectively prohibited the use of certain nets that have such small spaces as mosquito nets, which would scoop everything from the lake. Hon. Mang'oli understand this. The nets that have been banned are those with mesh sizes less than 50 millimetres or two inches wide. In the case of "omena", which are smaller fish,, the nets banned are those of not less than 10 millimetres wide. Therefore,	 </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MANG'OLI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Minister keeps on gesticulating as if this were also some language. Could he say what he wants to say rather than show us signs? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MIDIKA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the problem here is people who eat fish are too intelligent for other people to understand them. I would like to emphasise that trawl fishing, which uses big boats/ is completely banned in Lake Victoria. I want to take this opportunity to appeal to hon. Members from Mombasa, Kisumu, Turkana and Baringo to note that if people are allowed to destroy such natural resources of this country as fish, even econology will be interfered with. This is why I want to people in Webuye into to pollute River Nzoia. . The fish in Lake Victoria should be left clean. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MANG'OLI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Could the Minister substantiate his claim that we are polluting River Nzoia? This is a serious matter. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OKONDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am sure that the Minister is avoiding the question put to him. We are not talking about trawlers. I fully support him in banning trawler fishing in Lake Victoria and I have no interest in trawlers because they disturb the small scale fisherman. However, I want to know from him whether he has banned "gogo" nets. In Luhya this word is "likoko" while inMR. OKONDO (CTD.)English, it is "sail nets". I could tell him the meaning of the word in all the five languages that I know. These are the nets that are used on the beach, and they can be of various measures, such as 0.5 inches, two inches or even three inches wide. If he says that he bans nets with a certain width in millimetres, I agree with him, but if he says that he bans the use of "gogo" with meshes six inches wide, he should tell the House what he means. We have always used "gogo" nets from time immemorial and fish have never been finished. We have used sail nets to tach fish for centuries so long as they are six or seven inches wide or more. The Minister however says that .he has banned the use of all of "gogo" nets. Could he confirm as to whether he has banned the use of all "gogo" nets or only those of certain measurements? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MIDIKA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have said exactly what the hon. Member is dying. I have not banned the use of "gogo" nets in Lake Victoria, but I have banned the use of certain types of nets. I have also predicted the death of fish if we use these types of nets. I have already elaborated that that the measures already taken‚Äî </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OKONDO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. "Gogo" is sail net. The Minister is saying that he has not banned the use of "gogo", but beach nets. What does he mean by this? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MIDIKA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would have preferred it if the hon. Member had carried these nets to the House so that we could see the difference between what I am saying and what he is talking about? What I, as the expert and the Minister concerned, is that we have banned the use of certain sizes of nets, which are meshed in such a way that they look like mosquito nets which would scoop every fish from the lake. I these nets are used, I predict the death of all the fish in the lake. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OKONDO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Minister has told us what he means, but his Ministry has already put out circulars in western Kenya saying that all beach sail nets‚Äî </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Are you on a point of order or a supplementary-question? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OKONDO: It is a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because the minister is misleading the House by saying that he has not banned the use of "gogo" nets whereas there are circulars from his Ministry in western Kenya saying that all kinds of these nets are banned. Mr. Arunga, the Fisheries Officer, is the one who has issued these circulars. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MIDIKA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me assure the hon. Member from Bunyala and the House that the type of fishnets that have banned are well known even by fishermen. In fact, I received letters of congratulation from his own constituency thanking me for what I have done. </NEWSPEECH><HEADER>POINTS OF ORDER</HEADER><NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Mr. Biwott): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. On Tuesday, 16th October, 1990, the Kenya Times carried an article entitled "For Koigi, Njoya Changes His Tune" and on the same day, the Daily Nation carried another article entitled "Njoya Judge Not the Disssidents". In those articles, Njoya pleaded for justice and appealed to Kenyans not to say anything about Koigi but to let the court decide on the issue. The way those articles were written was innocuous but, in terms of concept and spirit, they were more in sympathy showing collusion between his own philosophy and utterances prior to that of Koigi and the rest. In my contribution, which appeard on Thursday, 1st November, 1990, I wondered why Njoya and the rest, instead of being shocked to learn of the activities and plots that Koigi was planning for this country, was sympathetic and appealed not to do anything against Koigi.THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY (CTD.)Of course, we will not do anything that is not right, because justice must be done by the law courts. We will, also treat this matter as sub judice until then.I wondered why, they choose to keep quite and to seek sympathy for them and I guessed that with all probability they must have been colluding together and then, he answers me now, this answer appeared on Sunday Time's and he brought in a lot of irrelevances because my focus was on his own utterances appealing to Kenyans, not to say anything about Koigi and not to judge anything I never went beyond that. Then he said that is the dove of Tumutumu, and I like that because it shows how small he is. He is a real tribalist of the village. In that one also, he talked of ignorance. He quoted a letter written to the Romans about ignorance, forgetting that I am a Kenyan, and those of us who are talking loud are Kenyans, but not Romans. When that letter was written to the Romans, Koigi never existed. 'I do not think that has got any relevance.So, I think it is better for Reverend Njoya to avoid being irrelevant although he talked about being ignorance. if there is anybody who is ignorant about our political system in this country and who is not working for stability in this country this must be done by everybody who is truthful, loyal to the country - and who is devoid of any plots against this country, is Njoya. If there is anybody who is so irrelevand and naive, it is also Njoya. What is talking about is irrelevant to the issue. I just wanted him to answer the very point why he changes his view now and talks of sympathy to somebody, who wanted to overthrow this Government and somebody who has been caught with arms, although, we do not want talk about this thing. Why does he now talk about the dove.THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY (CTD.) wanted to say that, maybe, he could be a crow among the dove's, he should check himself, else1 he is the Pharisee referred to in the Bible as having stood up and said "I am the innocent, I am the righteous and I am not as sinful as that individual".

It held discussion with the local leaders which included Government officers led by the District Commissioner, Marsabit, three Members of Parliament including hon. J.J. Falana, M.P. for Saku, Chairman County Council for Marsabit and a representative of the sponsor of St. John's Primary School.It was confirmed ‚Äòthat the camp is adjacent to and not in the school compound but quite near The site had been selected after a consultative meeting among local leaders who decided that it was the most suitable place and could be used to the refugees temporarily to enable the Government to determine their status and also find a more durable solution.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am very grateful to the leaders for the agreement that the camp remains in the same site for the time being. My Ministry further undertook to ensure that health and security measures are undertaken to safeguard the health and security of the area.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish at this juncture to express gratitude on behalf of my Ministry and that of the Government to the Leaders and people of Marsabit for showing this understanding and we look forward either co-operation in handling this matter.Thank you. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Nassir): Jambo la nidhamu, Bw.

I am now in a position to substantiate my remarks. Here I have the names of Heads of Departments in the lake Basin Development Authority Nine of these Heads of Departments are from South Nyanza District. Only two are from elsewhere; one from Kisii and the other one from Busia; I believe I have fully substantiated my statement and I beg to lay the document on the Table. </NEWSPEECH>(Mr.Okondo laid the document on the Table)<NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Next Order. </NEWSPEECH><HEADER>BILL</HEADER><HEADER>Second Reading </HEADER>The Lake Basin Development Authority (Amendment) Bill (The Assistant Minister for Regional Development (Mr. Muturia) on 31.10.:90)(Resumption of Debate interrupted on 1‚Äû11.90)<NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Hon. Kirwa </NEWSPEECH>.? <NEWSPEECH>MR. KIRWA: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute to this very important Bill. For this Authority to be effective, manpower in this Authority has to come from all the districts that are covered by the Authority.- It would be more useful if this Authority carried out a thorough reshufle within itself because as things stand now appointments in that particular organization are highly lopsided. It is going to be very hard for them to be effective unless the rest of the Kenyans are involved.-Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other issue "which is very important and which this organization should think about is the threshold number of employees that they are going to have in that particular organization. This is because it is going to be anomalous if the organization is going to employ 98 people to guard only six animals.Another issue which very important as far as this organization is concerned is serious accountability. I say this because many of the executives in our parastatel organizations have decided to make use of those organizations as business offices. I think it is high time that Kenyans thought seriously about the involvement of our to executives in other businesses related to their organizations. I say this because it is very hard for an executive to be impartial if that particular organization is going to have something to do with his business interests It is high time we Kenyans said that if you are an executive in a particular organization you should not do business with that organization. This is the only way in which we can ensure that these organizations run effectively.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I say this "because many of the top executives in these parastatals spend most of their time doing their own private businesses instead of running these organizations. This is why many of these parastatals are failing; they are being run down by individuals who are supposed to manage them effectively for the benefit of this country." This is a very serious matter because e private companies whose operations are similar to those of these parastatals are very successful when these parastatals are failing. These parastatals do not seem to do well and yet they receive a lot of funding from the Government Unless corrective measures are taken we are going to pump millions of Shillings into various parastatals and nothing is going to come out of these parastatals. The Ministry should h look into this matter so that we just do not spent taxpayers money on projects that are not going to be useful to our country.The other issue, Mr. Speaker, Sir, regards the misuse of vehicles." You will find that many of the top executives use Government vehicles during weekends. They use these vehicles as their own private vehicles. This is an issue that should be looked into. This is because if we allow vehicles to be used in that particular manner a lot of expenditure is going to be incurred to support private people's "businesses.- This is a very serious matter. Unless these parastatals are going to "be accountable to the public then Kenya will not get anywhere in terms of development.MR. KIRWA (CTD.);(The Speaker left the Chair)(The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Tuva) took the Chair)Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me now touch on donor-funded projects although these projects have "been useful to our country, they must now be vetted. This is because it is not useful for us to get money which is going to be wasted. I say so because when. Some of the donations that we get from donor countries you will find that a lot of this money is going to be wasted and the rest that will remain will be used "by the top executives of various organisations. It is very important for the Ministries involved to consider what is going to be done about these donor-funded projects.Documentation of various transactions that are entered into is also very important. It is important for the organizations involved, particularly the lake Basin Development Authority, to consider making proper documentation of any transactions that are going to be made. This should be done to ensure that public funds are properly accounted for.The other issue, as far as these organizations are concerned is courtesy. It is very hard to see some of these top executives. One HE wonders what kind of business they are doing with our brothers the Asians. If you go to some offices you will find that the people who are allowed to go in to see these executives are people with peculiar skin pigmentation." They normally come carrying brief cases‚Äù. Nobody knows what happens in some of these offices. Are they really public offices? This habit transcends down to the juniors. This is because if their seniorsMR. KIRWA (CTD.)are not going to take the public seriously even the juniors are not going to be serious with their work. What I am saying is that these organisations should realise that the money they are using is taxpayer‚Äôs money. The taxpayers money should hear ¬£ profit for the taxpayers. The managers of these organisations should show courtesy to the public. If they continue to be discourteous that is not going to be good for our country.Turning to my constituency although the lake Basin Development Authority although my constituency falls within the jurisdiction of the L.B.D.A., I am sorry to say that the organisation has never implemented a project m in my constituency since it‚Äôs inception. They never employed even a single casual labourer from my constituency. So, we are telling the Authority to consider all the areas involved so that every district feels that it is part and parcel of this Authority.Apart from employment the organization should consider tapping some water from Cherangani Hills and let it flow by the force of gravity to various parts of my constituency. That is the E22¬£ best project they can implement for my constituency. They should also consider providing some electricity to my constituency. They should also improve the road network in that particular area.With those few remarks, I beg to support.? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH> MR. MANG'OLI: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to speak on this very important amendment Bill.The Lake Basin Development Authority has been in existence for some time now but we have not realised anything from it. There is an outcry that the Authority is a toothless dog because it has not carried out the purposes and the objects for which it was established. As much as the Authority would like to enlarge its area of jurisdiction, we want to see what they are doing for those areas. We say so because feasibility study has been done for Webuye Falls and yet the Authority is not doing anything to identify sponsors. We want the Lake Basin Development Authority to deliver the goods to the people. The areas covered by the Authority were just mapped out and nothing has been done. Much of the money we vote for the Authority here goes towards payment of salaries instead of going towards development. If this is the case', then there is no need to support the Authority. We should not pass a Bill here to establish an authority only to create employment and salary for the staff. The authority should generate the objected terms and other things that should be done towards meeting the needs of the people.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, if the Lake" Basin Development Authority could properly identify the areas in which it could help farmers, then its objectives would be very noble. The Authority could alleviate the unemployment situation if it encouraged irrigation. The rivers are available as well as the swamps. In my area the Authority intended to initiate a fish farm costing about KShs.12 million and I even mentioned in this House last year that land for that purpose is available in Webuye. What went wrong? The KShs.12 million was passed but, as I am talking here now, the fish farm has not been started. So, I am wondering whether we are just here to create a Bill in terms of documents. If it is so, then I am wondering why it should be so.Looking at this Bill, it seems to have removed the chairman from appearing in the field. They have passed that power over to the managing director and I am suggesting that if there should be some checks and balances there must be somebody to check whether the going is correct. I am wondering why the powers of the chairman have been removed. Why should all the powers be given to the managing director? We would hope that when the Minister stands to reply he will explain why the powers of the chiarman were removed. If the chairman will be there, then we want to be told what purpose he will be serving. He will not be: just a rubber stamp just there to earn allowances. He has to work, and he can only work if he has the power. That is why we are saying that in their final preparation and launching of this particular Bill, they should be realistic and work within the framework of the Bill. The Bill sets out clearly the resources and "areas of attack or the targeted areas. They have come to amend the original Act to include Kericho, Uasin Gishu and Trans Nzoia districts and yet the Authority has not been effective in Western Province and Nyanza Province. So, we are wondering what enlarging the area means. There must be a purpose of enlarging the area and, therefore, they should come out and tell us comprehensively why they want these areas and how they are going to help them. We do not want them to seem to have a large area and yet they are not effectively delivering the goods to the people.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we would also like them to identify the sponsors of the projects that are earmarked for initiation.(Hon. Arte and hon. Mokku crossed the Floor without bowing)THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Omido): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Did you notice that when the two hon. Members were going behind you just touched your head instead of bowing in the normal manner? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Tuva): Carry on, hon. Mang'oli.MR. MANG'OLI: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. We would like hon. Members to observe our Standing in this House because this House can only be respected if we respect our Standing Order and the Chair. It is this House that sets the example for everything. It is the last resort for MR. MANG'OLI (CTD.)All purposes. Whatever one wants to say, this is the House. That is why a few ayukaring people seem to think that this House should be dissolved. They think that they are I in so much call that they want to come to this House. We must observe our regulations and respect hon. Members of this House.In that spirit, I would like to touch on some issues that involve hon. Members of Parliament. I have observed that sometimes in ceremonial times where His Excellency the President is addressing people, seats for permanent secretaries are put ahead of those for Members of Parliament. -We would like to tell the head of protocol to understand that hon. Members of Parliament are supreme and that permanent secretaries, if they wish, may resign to come to this House. Therefore, in future we would like the head of protocol to understand that when it comes to political rallies and arrangements, Members of Parliament should be seen within the reach of His Excellency the President. We are Members of Parliament and people must recognise that fact. That is why they resign and become Members of Parliament. We would like that to go in that vein just because of the observation hon. Omido has raised. I want to hammer this point home very clearly because when you go outside this country you find that Members of Parliament are very important people. Therefore, we must be respected at all levels.Sometimes during ceremonial occasions Members of Parliament have been given yellow cards to park their cars in ordinary areas. I want to warn and tell the head of protocol that in future Members of Parliament must be given red cards because that is their honour. It is their time when they are in this House. Until the House is dissolved, hon. Members must be respected at all levels.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have said that because we are now passing a Bill to set up this Lake Basin Development Authority. Without this House, then that Authority cannot exist. You can see how that symbolises the meaning of this House and what a Memer of Parliament means in this country. We speak these things without fear because we are in a democratic country. People" talk of democracies and in this country we have the best of democracy. There isMr. MANG`OLI (CTD.)Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is a very important Authority and we should not "belittle it I as saying this because this Authority can develop these areas and be able to grow a lot of rice and sugarcane, thereby creating employment opportunities for our people. However, we are going to take this Authority lightly by passing document here and then the Minister put his - - - - </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. LEMA: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Would I be in order to propose that the Mover be now called upon to reply, in View of the fact that a lot has been said about this particular bill. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>HON. MEMBER: NO! NO! NO! </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Tuva): Continue" Mr. Mang'oli. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MF.MANG`OLI: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker. We are talking about the Lake Basin Development Authority which is a very important authority and it is unfortunate that the hon. Member who comes from the Coast an wants to cut debate on this Bill short. Anyway, I was a saying that the Minister should know that we did not come here to read s documents ¬£ and although the set up of this Authority is clearly stipulated in the Bill, what is most important is the work that is going to be done on the √Ø ground. We would like to know, for example, what arrangements the Ministry has to revive fish farms in Webuye. I am saying this because Shs.12 million was allocated to this Authority and we would like the Minister to tell this House viable whether he has been able to identify projects to be undertaken? We would like the Lake Basin Development Authority to use their discretion to seeks funds outside this country as long as they would be able to repay it on their own. I am saying this because the Managing Director </NEWSPEECH>MR.QUORUM <NEWSPEECH>MR.MUKUNA: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. There is no quorum in the House. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Tuva): Yes, there, is no quorum. Will you ring the Division Bell all democracy and I wonder why people talk about lack of democracy in this country. Let them go outside and they will see for themselves that it is not easy for people to discuss a Bill like this one. We are saying that we! Respect the Minister for Regional Development and we want this particular Authority to become a reality; let it become functional. We do not want to discuss Bills here only for them to be carried in briefcases. We are giving them the authority to borrow under the scheme through this Act is being established. Therefore, we would like to see the Minister take that authority and make sure that the Lake Basin Development Authority becomes a reality that benefits the people of the districts he has now incorporated, that is, Uasin Gishu, Trans Nzoia, Kericho and Nyanza Province. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Tuva): we have a quorum now. Can you continue, Mr. Mang'oli </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MANG‚ÄôOLI: Mr. Temporary Deputy-Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the hon. Member who raised the quorum so that we have enough hon. Members when We are discussing this very important matter. Hon. Members must remember that they are paid to be here and if We are going to continue lacking quorum in this manner, this is no rather absurd.Having said that, I would like to say that this particular Bill seems to be favouring the civil servants. I am wondering why every time they draft a Bill like this, they appoint a Permanent Secretary who is a very "busy person in the Ministry why do they not consider appointing members of Parliament as members of the Board? we want them to know- that this House which comprises of 200 hen. Members, has the brains that ought to be used in these boards. I am saying that because hon. "embers are more effective Secondly, this Bill is political, for it to be implemented fully, we need members of Parliament to be appointed members of the draft committee. All the Bills that are drafted favour Ismail Permanent Secretaries by appointing them into the various boards and committees. This is why you find these parastatal bodies always mailing losses ana others collapsing. This is because these Permanent Secretaries are busy people ana have no time to attend to parastatal matters. So, when the legal section of the Attomey-General Chambers is drafting these Bills, we would like them to incorporate members of Parliament so that they are involved in the initial drafting of the Bills. If the Percent Secretary is only good in mathematics, how do you expect him to know anything about agriculture. Therefore, I would like the Minister to delete Permanent Secretary are insert in the place thereof, Member of Parliament.Mr. MANGOLI (CTD.)It is important that the Minister in his response tell us what he intends to do about this. The Lake Basin Development Authority has even engaged the services of provincial commissioners whose aim is to promote their own interests because they also want to become politicians. When such a. provincial commissioner retires, he will become Member of Parliament and say: "I am the one who initiated this particular project." We do not want them to take advantage of us. Vie want to be there so that we can control them also. For example, the Director of Water Development involved in this Authority. Now, what is he supposed to do? When the Minister cones to reply, he should ensure that hon. Members are incorporated in this particular Bill. The Attorney-General should also see to it that hon. Members have a part of play in these authorities. we should also have committees where hon. Members can scrutinize and understand Bills well so that they can pass them after a thorough understanding.This Authority is a noble body but it seems we only pass votes here for their salaries. This is because there is no project they have carried successfully. The first Chairman of this Authority case from my constituency and he initiated many projects which are new at a standstill. I hope that the Minister will readiest for funds from the a Office of the "vice-President and Ministry of Finance in order to finance the projects which are now at a standstill, We have the Webuye Falls project which we hope will be a reality after, the finances are approved. We do not want to be told everyday that such and such a project will be completed when funds become available. We are tired of that. "We are also tired of being told when we bring Questions or Motions to this House that the projects in question will be done when funds become available.These authorities should be given power to solicit for funds and complete the necessary projects. "We are all looking forward for this Authority to become a reality upon passing this Bill. This Authority should generate employment because it is a huge body.The Minister should go to g friendly countries, such as, Korea and japan minus those countries that are championing the opposition of this country and look for funds to finance some of these projects. When such funds are acquired, donor countries should not bring in their personnel to man the projects. We have our own people, such as, agriculturalists, who have no jobs, we want them to absorb in these projects. We have labour and we want them to give us the money to develop because we are the ones who know this country better. Some of the so called experts who have been E brought here are maybe from the CIA group. For example, on a may not have a certficate in anything but- he may be the one leading the project implementing group. All that he carries are files and nothing else.When the Minister comes to reply, he should tell us that he is going to immediately implement the Maturo Fish Farm. The Minister stood in this House and told us that they were moving to the site but nothing has happened. As far as the acquisition of land is concerned, the people so affected must be compensated fully. The Authority should see to it that it preserves the water catchment areas. Rain water and water from Lake Victoria cost be exploited-and-used, adequately for irrigation ana so on.Since hon. Nassir would like to speak on this Bill, I will wind up so that he can have a chance to speak. I am sure he is going to warn the clergymen particularly the Njoya type to the effect that Kenya is stable under the wise leadership of his Excellency the President. They should also know that nothing, is going to shake this country whatsoever. With the President in the forefront, we can assure the world that we are in control. With those few remarks. I beg to support the Bill. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>KR. OMINO: Thank You, Sir, for giving me an opportunity to contribute to this debate. I have listened very carefully to the various Members of Parliament who have spoken and it seems to me that there is a slight measure of confusion as to the functions of an Authority.My understanding-of an Authority such as this one is that it is first and foremost a planning authority. But criticism after criticism has been leveled at the Lake Basin- Development Authority for lack of action. I would like to suggest to the hon. Members of this House to visit the offices of the Authority and see for themselves the amount of planning work that they have done. This is available in documents which can be availed to the hon. Members in order to get rid of this obvious ignorance and is bias towards the Authority.This Authority should be charged with the responsibility of providing infrastructure in those areas where it cannot be provided by local authorities. If we ever want to rural with our industries, there is no better body than a development authority to provide that infrastructure. The failures of the Lake Basin Development Authority can only be measured against the successes of the other authorities. But more importantly against the level of funding that the other authorities have been endowed with. This Authority is grossly underfunded and there is no point criticizing it for lack of action when, in fact, it has not been given the ability with which to act.The Lake Basin Development Authority area has a number of rivers from which we can generate electricity. Everybody here knows that you cannot build a hydro-electric dam using jembes. You need equipment which must be bought with money. He would like this Authority to be enabled in exactly the same way the Tana and Athi Rivers Development Authority and the Kerio Valley Development Authority have been enabled to construct large schemes.If you take the Lake Basin Development Authority, we have the Migori River, Kuja River, Sonau Mriu River, River Nyando, Yala River and Nzoia River which discharge their waters into lake and are all suitable for electricityMR. OMINO (CTD.)generation. It is time this area was given the recognition that it deserves because generation of electricity from these rivers will only add to our self-sufficiency in electricity generation. If we are self-sufficient, we can Export the excess. As you know, Uganda is now exporting electricity to this country and there is no reason why it cannot be the reverse. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OMINO (CTD.)Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Lake Basin area, as it is now, is large enough: It is has a high population concentration. So, to add more to it, is, in my view, to overburden it with areas that it will not adequately serve, unless and until, its level x of funding is increased; if more funds were made available this area would be this county's granary. I would like to point out one specific area, namely the lambwe Valley. In my humble and considered view, there is no reason why we will need a small national park in the lambwe Valley when we have the Masai Mara next to it. Nobody will waste his time going to look at a few antelopes in the Lambwe Valley when he can see them in their thousands in the Masai Mara. So, this area ought to be converted into a settlement so that it provides the food that this country so badly requires.Reference has been made that there is tribalism in employment by the authority. We have to make up our minds as to whether we are tribalists or nationalists, for we cannot be both. When you look carefully at the people who have been said to belong to, tribe, or is one section, you 'will see that all of them are technical people who were employed on merit. The day we win discard merit in order to strike a tribal balance, this country will be s lost. I would have like/hon. Okondo to give me a list of the employees of Mumias,or. Nzoia, Sugar Company to see if there is a better tribal? balance here than there is in the LBDA; We cannot pretend about this matter, we either go for merit or mediocrity; if we choose the latter, we are doomed.The amended Bill proposes that information collected by the authority should be confidential. Given that the L3DA is a public institution, if the information it collects cannot be made Mr. OMINO (CTD.)available to members of the public, it will not serve a useful purpose. So, I would like the Minister to look into this amendment again and make a provision so that if I have identified a viable Project within the lake Basin area and I want to implement it, the authority must be required to give me certain information. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>Mr. MANGOLI: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy, Sir. Is hon. Omino sincere when he says that the LBDA has only employed technical people when we know this is not true? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Tuva)-: Mr. Mang'oli- that is not a point of order! Sit down. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OMINO: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, even if it were a point of order, I would not have bothered to answer it. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MANGOLI: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy, Sir. Is the hon. Member in order to say that the nine officers were employed because they were technical people while there were other more technically qualified people who were not employed? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OMITO: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am not they employing authority at the LBDA, "but I would like to assure hon. Mang'oli that the people listed in that document are technical.Lake Victoria waters are important for this country.I was glad to see the n other day the Minister for Water Development state categorically that Kenya Government will not sign the so called "Undugu Agreement" involving all liperian states around the Lake. I made this point before and I would like to make it again. First and foremost, the rivers discharging water into Lake Victoria must serve Kenya first, there being an agreement or no agreement. So, I hope the Minister, in collaboration with the Minister for 'water Development, will ensure that policies -will be designed which will give Kenya the first priority on the‚Äù ‚Äúuse of the waters discharging into the Lake. MR. OMINO (CTD.)Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I made reference to fishing when we were discussing the Ministry's Vote and I must say again that we must now reserve fishing to indigenous Kenyans and indigenous Kenyans only. The x Minister must assure this House that? In addition to banning certain types of nets, he will also ban non-Kenyans from fishing: "The fish has been preserved by Kenyans and it-cannot be exploited by non Kenyans because that is exporting our fish to foreign countries.The lake Basin area, as I said earlier," "can, in fact, be the granary for this country. we want the authority to be funded sufficiently to be able to undertake rented rice scheme programmer, which will make this c our try self-sufficient in rice; we want the authority to be funded sufficiently to enable it encourage and provide infrastructure to farmers to gar grow cotton so that we can be self-sufficient in cotton production; we want it to help in the promotion sugar-cane cultivation so that we can be self-sufficient in the production of sugar. All these are important tasks which cannot be discharged if -there no money. I hope that the Minister will en sure that negotiations are conducted with the relevant authorities to provide sufficient funds in order to enable this authority and, indeed, other authorities to do the work for which they were set up.It is no use for us to criticize the if, in fact, what it takes to make it successful is not there. I submit that what it takes to make it successful is money.With those few remarks, I wish to support. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING- (Mr. Nassir): Ahsante sana, Bw.

Nafikiri Serikali ilienzisha zsmz mamlaka ya ustawi, kama hili la LBDA na mengine, k¬ªva sababu tuna watu wengi wanaohitaji kazi. Eitu muhimu si jina la mraai -,Ya maendeleo ila ni vitendo.

Tukiansisha, mradi wa maendeleo v/a watu wa sehemu fulani ya nchi hii, tuwapa uwezo wa kuendesha kila kitu. mgawa sitaki kuilaumu Serikali, najua kuna Katibu mmoja mkuu ambaye anasimamia mashirika. ya reli, ndege na-Mamlaka ya-Bandari".Kenya, na ninashangaa kama mtu huyu mmoja atasoma xaili z	ote sa mashirika haya </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Nassir) (CTD.) Ni lazima tuyachunguze zaidi mambo ya Lake basin Development Authority kwa sababu ikiwa hatutafanya hivyo, basi tutapata taabu nyingi sana nchini, na tayari tunafahamu kuwa h'ivi sasa tumo ndani ya taabu.Tunajionea, Bw. Spika wa Muda, wingi wa watu hapaNairobi. Watu , wanajitafutia mapato kwa njia nyingi, kama vile kuendesha vioski, na mambo mengine mengi. Ni hivyo hivyo huko Mombasa, Nakuru na kwingineko. Nia nzuri ni kuwapeleka watu kwenye mashamba wayalime. Hayati Mzee Kenyatta - na Mungu ambariki na kumweka mahali pema - alipoushika uongozi kwanza, alisema watu 4 warudi mashambani. Alianzisha settlement schemes nyingi sana kote nchini, ijapokuwa si si "mashetani" tukayatwaa mashamba mengine badala ya kuwapatia wale waliokuwa wanayahitaji zaidi. Lakini nasema tusivunjike moyo. Shirika hili linafaa kutafuta njia ya kuwapatia watoto wetu nafasi za kazi. Tuna mashirika mengi sana ya Seri kali yanayoweza kusaidia kwa njia hiyo. -Hata hivi majuzi Mtukufu Rais alisema kuwa kuna kampuni moja ya tumbaku ambayo inayashinda mashirika mengi sana ya Seri kali. Je, kama ni Mzungu mmoja huko, na kwenye mashirika yetu kuna Waafrika wengi wanaosimamia mashirika hayo, ni nini kinachotendeka? Si ubongo ni ule ule? Ni lazima kil a mmoja wetu awee na jukumu la kuitengeneza Kenya kwa watoto wetu. Sote tumeisikia hali ya Tana and Athi Rivers Development Authority na hata sasa nina shaka kama mambo yaliyokuwa mabaya yamerekebishwa. Sehemu inayosimamiwa na Lake Basin Development Authority ni moja ambayo imebarikiwa na Mwenyezi Mungu kuwa na maji tele. Sasa tunashindwa na Myahudi ambaye ana jangwa na analima sana na kutoa machungwa mengi sana. Hata siku hizi tumeshindwa katika kilimo cha ngano na hali kinafanyiwa sehemu za jangwa. Mwenyezi Munyu ametupa baraka kuwa na maji chungu nzima‚Äî- </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Tuva): Ningetaka ufahamu kuwa mara unapoanza kuzungumza kwa lugha moja, unafaa kuendelea kwa lugha hiyo tu. Unaweza tu kusema kwa lugha nyingine kama unanakili jambo fulani, kama ulivyosema kuhusu Hayati Mzee Kenyatta. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Nassir): Ahsante, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda. Mimi pia napenda kusema kwa lugha ya Kiswa- hili kama wewe. Kwa hivyo, nitaendelea kusema kwa lugha ya Kiswahili.Hamu yangu kubwa ilikuwa ni kuwaomba ndugu zangu kufanya bidii wanapopatiwa nafasi ya kuwasaidia wenza√∂, hasa kupitia kwa mashirika kama haya ya Lake Basin Development Authority na Tana and Athi Rivers Development Authority. Nimesema kuwa kuna maji mengi sana katika sehemu inayosimamiwa na Lake Basin Development Authority na ni kukatwa kwa mitaro tu na maji mengi yakatawanywa kwingi na kuwe na kilimo zaidi cha machungwa na mimea mingineyo. Nimesema pia kuwa mashirika ya Serikali yana wajibu wa kufanya kazi zaidi. Kama watu fulani wamepatiwa nafasi ya kusimamia mashirika kama hayo, wana- paswa kufanya hivyo kwa bidii sana.Nikisoma kwenye Mswada huu, naona kuwa mambo yatakuwa yakisimamiwa hapaNairobi na Katibu wa Kudumu na, wanapopatiwa jukumu hilo, basi wawapatie wananchi nafasi za kazi. Pia, tuwe na wafanyakazi ambao wana ujuzi. Nina- choogopa ni watu wetu wengi kuwa bil a kazi. Inafaa tutilie mambo kama haya nguvu kwa sababu nchini Kenya leo hatuna mambo ya taabu. Siasa zimekwisha kwa sababu wale tunaowawaki1isha wana hamu ya kazi na ardhi ya kulima na pia nafasi za k'uwasomesha watoto wao. Tumeongea siasa na wananchi wakachoka na sasa wanataka kazi. Kwa sababu hiyo, ningeomba mashirika yetu yafanye jitihada kuwapatia wananchi wetu nafasi za Kazi.Kwa hayo machache, naunga mkono. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Kibaki): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, could you possibly entertain my proposal, since the debate is becoming repetitive, that the Mover be called upon to reply?(Question, that the Mover be called upon to reply, put and agreed to) </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Midika): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise to attempt to reply to all the points raised by hon. Members. I also want to congratulate hon. Members for being articulate about what the Lake Basin Development Authority should do. I appreciate thatTHE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (CTD.) they did not call a spade a big spoon. I would also like to take this opportunity to assure hon. Members that we must try very hard not to be like ostriches with our heads burried in the sand.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, when my good colleagues, hon. Makau and hon. Okondo were contributing to this debate, I hope it was not deliberate on their part when they said that the Lake Basin Development Authority had done nothing. I want to assure this House that the Authority was charged with the responsibility of planning for development and for writing documents which will be used to finance development in the Lake Basin area. The Authority has performed adequately, efficiently and with a lot of technical know-how. I want to take this opportunity to congratulate "the present Managing Director of the Authority for having been very conscious about what the Authority is all about. As a result, Mr. Obura has done what many could not do.I used to be like other hon. Members when I used to talk about the Lake Basin Development Authority until I came to know the actual responsibility of the Authority. As the Minister in charge, I would like to appeal to hon. Members, particularly those who are very critical to come forward and assist us. All the Lake Basin Development Authority needs now is money. All the planning, feasibility studies, documentation, research and every other thing has been done with the little money we have. We now need a minimum of some Ksh.23 billion in order to initiate and implement about 20 projects written up by the Authority. At a later date, we may even need more than Ksh.100 billion to implement all the projects that the Authority has identified. If, at the moment, we implement the 20 identified projects, the Authority will be in a position to employ not less than 500,000 jobless Kenyans. THE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (CTD.)This is why I want to appeal to hon. Members to come forward and assist us in getting the required money. Planning and implementation are two different things. The Authority cannot move without money, any money that is given to the Authority is either guaranteed by this House or passed by the House through the Budget. All hon. Members know this and hon. Makau, who should have known better, should have‚Äî </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MAKAU: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. The hon. Minister should have respect for contributions in this House. When I contributed to this Bill, I gave ideas to how the Lake Basin Development Authority should stop being parochial and how such an Authority should look for funds from foreign donors. If the Minister had been here then, he would have heard what I said. We are only trying to make the Authority more creative‚Äî </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TMEPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Tuva): What is your point of order? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MAKAU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, my point of order is that I want to ask the Minister to get our ideas and stop minding about the hon. Members who contributed them. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Tuva): That is a point of information. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MAKAU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, our Standing Orders provide that in a case like this, one talks about the ideas involved without mentioning the names of the people who contributed them. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Midika): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir,- when I opened my speech, I said that hon. Members, such as hon. Makau and hon. Okondo, spoke and maybe they were misquoted by the Press; As for me, I have never been misquoted by the Press, and I hope that hon. Makau was not misquoted. Perhaps the Press did not carry, his contribution properly, but it does not deliberately misquote people. What I want to repeat is that our responsibility is planning whereas implementation must pass through this House. As I have said, if we implement the 20 projects that have-been identified and documented, the Lake Basin Development Authority will immediately employ no lessTHE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (CTD.) 0.5 million jobless Kenyans, for which purpose we will need no less than Shs.23 billion. Knowledge should be respected, and I am sure that the officers who did this job were very knowledgeable and the documents involved are available for inspection by hon. Members at the headquarters of the Authority.As has been intimated by some hon. Members, the Authority has been charged with the responsibility of looking into fish problems, and I want to use this opportunity to appeal to the hon. Members of this House and the public in general. We are facing a problem in this country which we might not correct later if we do not do so now, and this is the problem of pollution. Nzoia, Nyando and all other big rivers that empty their waters into Lake Victoria are gradually being badly polluted by the sugar factories that empty their effluent into these rivers. It is easy to control this effluent, and I would like all sugar factories that empty their effluent into these rivers to do what Chemelil Sugar Company has done. They should have proper lagoons. If we pollute the lake, we will no longer continue to have fish there.Hoping that hon. Okondo is here at the moment, I want to take this opportunity to assure the House that what hon. Okondo said here was tribalistic. I know that he is half Luo, although I do not know whether he wanted to be a full Luo. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MRS. NDETEI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I am still concerned about the remarks the hon. Minister is making in reply to this Bill. I am sure that whatever contribution was made by hon. Okondo and hon. Makau, it was done in good faith, but the Minister appears to have been offended by what these hon. Members said. This is should not be encouraged in this House, and the Minister should desist from this insinuation. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Tuva): He has not lost his temper yet. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Midika): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Gracious Lady can rest assured that I have never been offended by these two hon. Members. Hon. Okondo was my Minister for almost a THE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (CTD.) year and is still a great friend of mine although he is half-Luo and half-Luhyia. I want to assure this House that the names he bought here did not belong to people in Karachuonyo. I personally know that only two of them belonged to people from Karachuonyo, who were technically qualified. These people did an interview in which they beat many other candidates. So, the hon. Iron Lady must agree that I was trying to take seriously what hon. Okondo said. He said that the Lake Basin Development Authority was formed many years ago. We have done quite a lot in Bunyala </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MAKAU: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Minister mentioned the hon. Iron Lady, and I want to know who this is. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Tuva): If you said this, Mr. Midika, you should explain who this hon. Iron Lady is. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Midika): I was referring to that hon. Lady over there. Maybe she not an Iron Lady, but just an hon. Lady. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Tuva): Mr. Midika, if you used that terminology, you must withdraw the remark. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Midika): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I must withdraw that remark because the hon. Gracious Lady wants to lay all of herself on the Table and that is dangerous. I must withdraw my remark and apologise to the hon. Lady. She should not lay herself on the Table. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>AN HON. MEMBER: Who is this lady? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Midika): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is only one lady here at the moment.I also want to thank hon. Members for </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Karauri): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. With all due respect to the Minister, did I hear him say that the hon. Lady was going to lay herself on the Table? If so, this is very improper. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Midika): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I did not hear that. THE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (CTD.)One project that I would like to bring up in this debate, which I think hon. Members touched on just slightly is the production of cotton. It is the wish of the Lake Basin Development authority that production of cotton in this country be increased and the policy of selling the crop be changed so that farmers may sell their cotton to ginneries which, in turn, should sell it direct to factories. It is only when farmers receive their money immediately on delivery of the crop that the people of this country will grow more cotton. The Lake Basin Development Authority is working on papers which will help us in implementing this policy.Hon. Members were very much concerned about fish production. This should be left to Kenyans, and for the last many months, I have been trying to ensure that fishermen who are cheated by middle men are fully protected so that fishing is left to Kenyans. We have just realised that fish has become one of the most foreign exchange earners in this country. As a result, many middle men who are not Black Africans have moved into the fishing industry so fast that we cannot stop any Kenyan from trading in fish. I agree with hon. Members that fishing should now be left to the people of this country.THE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (CTD.);Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank hon. Members very much for  giving suggestions which will now be adopted to help the Lake Basin Development Authority which has now been widened to include Kericho District, parts of Nandi District and Trans-Ksoia District. I am sure that hon. Members from these areas will rest assured that as long I am still there I will make sure that the benefits they reap from the L.B.D.A. are enormous.'Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as one hon. Member said, we must be serious in this country." We must be Kenyans/ If E we begin accusing ourselves in this House of being tribalistic then we are becoming too small."" We must big enough to realise that we are Kenyans men a 25 Kenyan with technical qualifications is employed to do a job and he proves that he is able to do the job surely tribal considerations should always come last. We must be patriotic and nationalistic We must look at ourselves as Kenyans; not as people from Muhoroni, Bunyala, Omena and so on. We are Kenyans and we must be big enough to look at ourselves as Kenyans. Hon. Members should note carefully that if the Director of the Lake Basin Development Authority i wan Mr. Obura, was given the money today. If after Mr. Obura has been given the money ZHasoasy somebody stands up in this House and proves that Mr. Obura has misused that money, I will support him. But Mr. Obura has never had any money. So, you cannot blame somebody who has nothing for doing nothing. This is because with nothing, you can do nothing. So, I hope some hon. Members like my great friend, hon. Makau, will assist us with ideas; how we can XH secure money. We HHMI√ú need this money. We want to succeed like the other Authorities that have succeeded." V/e saw it in the last Budget; that I if Authorities are givenTHE MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (CTD.);enough money they will succeed. Authorities without money are not authorities.- So, to be an Authority with some authority, you need money With these few remarks, I beg to move? </NEWSPEECH>(Question put and agreed to)(The BILL was read a Second Time and committed to a Committee of the whole House tomorrow)<HEADER>SECOND READING</HEADER>The Unit Trusts (Amendment) Sill<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr.: Kariuki): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I "beg to move that the unit Trusts (Amendment) Bill be now read a Second Time.In moving this Bill, I have got a few things to say,;- Like I said last week when I was moving the Export Processing Zones Bill, the world is currently moving very fast and Kenya has no intention whatsoever of being left behind. For this reason, the Government has recently come up with very novel and imaginative ideas to make sure that we keep in touch with modern economies and very sophisticated commercial activities in the world today As hon. Members have realized of late, we have established a Capital Markets Authority. Through this Authority and through the Stock. Markets in Kenya, we hope and we indeed trust, that there will be more and more companies going public. All the share issues that have been floated in the last few years do indicate that in THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr.Kariuki) (CTD.);Kenya people still have some money that is floating around waiting for suitable and profitable investment. All the shares that have been floated recently have in fact been over-subscribed. This shows that there are still opportunities for this kind of investments;5 Therefore in order to smoothen and straighten the way for these welcome developments, to remove any hurdles that may exist on the way, and in order to make it possible for small investors with little money to be able to take advantage of these shares-floated, it is necessary to make a certain adjustments in our laws relating to Unit Trusts.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, through Unit Trusts, more investors will be able to pool in their resources to purchase a block, of shares; through forming a unit trust Unlike companies, these trusts do actually enjoy certain major tax benefits This will also enable investors to invest in various portfolios at one go.The Capital Markets Authority was established in December, 1989. The passage of the Capital Markets Authority Act in 1989, that laid the ground for its establishment was a milestone in the financial market. It provides the framework for the deepening and broadening of these markets in order to enable the financial system to better intermediate the risks; provide for better management of liquidity; induce efficiency in resources allocation and mobilization and to provide financial resources to finance long term developmentTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OP FINANCE (Mr: Kariuki) (CTD.);Hon Members will remember that during the Budget Speech of 1990/91, the Vice-President and Minister for Finance outlined measures to revitalise the Unit Trusts Act of 1987; to enable it to become a viable investment vehicle within the framework of the financial system in general and capital markets in particular. This was another important step in revitalising financial markets in the country. The Unit Trusts Act, in its present form, has not fostered development of these financial instruments since its inception in 1987. Yet Unit Trusts is such an important investment vehicle that full operation should be achieved in the shortest practical time. The basic instruments of Unit Trusts rest in their capacity in diver shifiting risks through pooling of marketable securities for guaranteeing a resonable returns on investments.One of the reasons for the inadequate performance of the Unit Trusts Act, has been the absence of an institutional framework to provide for the operational utilisation of the Act With the establishment of the Capital Markets Authority, that framework is now well in place It has been proposed earlier that the supervision and regulation of the Act be removed from the Registrar of Companies to the Central Bank of Kenya. After further consideration of the mairfcer, it became clear that the Act ought to be implemented under the auspices of the Capital Markets Authority since unit trusts are substantively capital markets instruments. In any event the Capital Market Authority Act indeed does provide for the introduction and administration of this investment vehicle." It is proposed to amend the Act by replacing THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr.Kariuki) (CTD.);the words "Registrar of Companies" where they appear in the Act, with the "Capital Markets Authority" and to make such other changes as will engender. Consistency in the law with the objective of placing the developmental, prudential supervisory and regulatory controls of unit trusts where they belong the right law.THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Kariuki) (CTD.)Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in brief, what I was trying to explain is the importance, now that we the Capital Markets Authority, of having laws that are relevant and that will enhance the operation of the Capital Markets Authority. As I said, the Unit Trusts will enable small investors to join together and form groups whereby they can buy shares in a particular company or certain securities in particular institutions in block. That way, they will be liable to have certain tax exemptions that would normally not be available we're they to form companies. Like I said also, it will also enable investors who do not want to put their money at risk in one particular company to buy shares in various companies which are joined together and Ander a basket under the Trust. I do hope that at least all hon. Members are very conscious of this matter since we all agree that commercial activities have to be enhanced in this country and since we agree that we have to give1 even the smallest investors an opportunity to share in the national cake of the companies that are in Kenya. I do hope that hon. Members will find no difficulties at all in supporting this Bill.With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. kibaki): Mr. Temporary Deputy speaker, Sir, in seconding this Bill, I have only one or two things to say. First, and perhaps foremost, is in reference to Unit Trusts. What really matters in the final analysis is management of these Unit Trusts. Like all these companies we have within our economy which are going into liquidation, it is just a question of mismanagement. And we are going to continue having this problem of management. So, what one really does hope is that whether these Unit Trusts are managed under the Capital Markets Authority - which is a very good idea - or whether under the Central Bank or remain with the Registrar of Companies, the final analysis is who is managing the Units and whether they are taking care of those investing THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH (CTD.)in them. That is what will encourage, the investments.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, Kenyans have a lot of money to invest because anything that has been floated in the Capital Market of Nairobi has been over-subscribed by two to three times. That shows that there are substantial resources for investment and, therefore, people would invest if a Unit Trust was to show that it earns good interest. That means that it has to choose its judgment where to put the money and in what companies to invest the money because it is a- secondary investor. Therefore in order to build that confidence, it is the management that will have to be looked into, and I am sure that that is what will matter in the end.Perhaps, Sir, more importt to mention this time is that Kenyans have shown, over the last 10 years or so, that they are still saving something between 20 and 25 per cent of our national income. That percentage is being saved and invested, but not directly to where it should go. People save and save it with the bank; they are not direct investors. So, it becomes the banks that we do investments for. But the Unit Trust has the advantage because if I have some savings I will put it in a small company that can help me to invest directly in form of shares. So, what we want is to build a base'. By there very nature, Unit Trusts are looking more to the small investor who cannot go alone and who requires to join others so that they may be able to buy a substantial number of shares in a company and, therefore, put their savings into profitable use.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is very important that the Central Bank of Kenya has been given authority to inspect these Unit Trusts because this kind of inspection will at least bring to light anything going wrong before we reach the point of bankruptcy or dissolution. So, to that extent, this amendment is extremently welcome.The other point that I should perhaps mention in this regard regards the Capital Markets Authority itself. We are experimenting a new idea. Capital markets authority is a development which will be very significant in this nation THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH (CTD.)in the future. So, it needs to start well, and to start we'll means to encourage companies to go public and to encourage companies to go public is to tell them the whole truth that a company which goes public and only sells 10 per cent of its total shares to the public but retains 90 per cent in the hands who control it is still a controlled company. So, it is rationing what is available, and by rationing you are raising prices because you create demand and you have nothing much to offer. So, the prices are artificially boosted. So, hopefully, when the Capital Markets Authority settles down, they may come to establish minimum rule's that for anybody to be admitted into the institution, he must float a certain proportion of the total equity and not between five per cent and 15 per cent. One should float something substantial which change's the nature of the company, something upwards of 30 per cent or over one third. That way, there will be genuine trading. But if you ration how much you may issue, you will still control the price and you are boosting the value of those who hold 90 per cent on the basis of selling only .10 per cent. So, that is game a little bit obnoxious, to use a mild English word.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is something that might need to be looked into by the Capital Markets Authority and be spoken about openly and in whatever circulars they may write to whoever wants to go public. They should be told some of these things.Perhaps, equally important is that when companies go public the general public should be given the audited reports as is required in all capital markets in the world, and in good time. You know, if a company is public and continues to market its shares, those who are buying and selling should get the annual audited reports as soon after the company's financial year so that the information used in judging which shares to buy and what price to offer is genuine', relevant and very recent. It should not be historical information which might have gone out of date totally. So, a rule -like that will be required, and we hope that theTHE MINISTER FOR HEALTH (CTD.)Capital Markets Authority will not hesitate to make such rules that companies which go public should publish their audited reports soon after the financial year has ended so that we know whether to go on.THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH (CTD.)Nowadays, you want to look at that information and in so doing you have to so through the experts who are very few. These Stock Exchange brokers are just handful and in any case, I do not know on what they base their judgement. Perhaps they use what they call a hunch. It is normal these days to hear somebody saying, "I have a hunch that this company will go up or down or will remain stable". I think this is absolutely vague! However, if these reports are published on time, then everybody will have enough time to read them and be able to verify them. So, this would be very useful. I would like to Eg: say that it would be very helpful from the point of view of the general public, if those who sell shares would, where possible, re-invest by buying new stocks in within the country. I am saying this because it is s a matter that could help us a great deal in the end. Let this not be used as a channel for merely realising iKvia individual's investment and then send it to wherever one wants to. Let this be a channel for realising part of the investment and then ploughing the other half to greater investment so that it can create the spirity of buying more shares.Finally, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to appeal EE to the Capital Markets Authority to take time off and write a little booklet in English and iiiswahili which would explain this concept of investment. The general concept of investment is known to many Kenyans, because most of us knows how to buy a share in a company since we have been buying shares in the various companies, some of which do well while other do not. The Unit Trust is still a novel concept to many Kenyans and therefore, we require further information and explanation. I do therefore, hope that a booklet on how the Unit Trust do operate will be public in both Kiswahili and English and be male generally available to Kenyans who would like to buy it, with those few remarks! beg to second. </NEWSPEECH>(Question proposed)<NEWSPEECH>MR.MAKAU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this amendment Sill is seeking to amend the Unit Trust .;ct, which .has been there for the last 27 years having been enacted in 1963 Apart from the amendment that MR.MAKAU (CTD.);we are discussing, the original Act itself is not new to us.-Although this Act has "been existing for the last 27, there is has never been a time when this Act was practised in this country.Having said that, I would like to start my contribution to the debate or. this Bill by congratulating his Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Finance for Tabling this Bill in this House. This Bill is going to prepare this country for industrial and commercial take off. I am saying this because, we have just passed a Bill on the Export Processing Zone and the establishment of Capital Market Authority and other Bills concerned with finance, whiile debating this amendment Bill, we should realize that it is aimed at.putting Kenya into a better position as far as investment is concerned. At the moment, there are countries that have established fund it unit trusts/but in Africa, we have only four countries, namely, Morocco, Zimbabwe, Egypt and Kenya. This shows that Kenya is going to join a club of countries that have benefited due to the establishment of unit trust fund. This is another method of enabling people to get into "business through the purchase of shares that are not directly bought through the Stock Exchange. In this area, we have professional fund managers who do the work on "behalf of the businessman who would like to invest is money.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the advantage that the Unit Trust Fund has in business, is the use of professional fund managers who look around for areas where investment could be undertaken profitably. As I said, this is not something new in that we xaran already had an Act existing although they it was not being practised. 'Those involved never did the counter balancing to know the gains and losses and that is why most people lost interest in this -business. So, this Bill will activate whatever has been existing and the amendment therefore is solely aimed at updating whatever has been existing to make sure that anomalies are removed wherever they used to exist in the original Act. In the original Act, if anybody wanted to deal with the unit trust, one had to register with the registrar of companies and the Central Bank of Kenya and the Treasury did not having anything to do with this very important instrument of business.MR.MAKAU (CTD.);Therefore, this amendment Bill is trying to make sure that those who deal with investments are protected by the Central Bank and Treasury. Everybody in business is aware that Kairobi Stock Exchange has been criticised due to lack of financial inertia. It has more or less been operating like a telephone exchange. If today, you asked anybody where the Nairobi Stock-: Exchange is, not so many people would know where it is. we know that the Nairobi Stock Exchange is operating but with the passing of this Bill, its efforts will be enhanced. I as saying this because with the passing of this amendment Bill, the Banks are going to act as trustees so that if anybody wants to invest, he would have access to professional advice and financial support. This is why I am saying that we are getting into a stage in this country where, if you want to get into business, you can use professions to advise you on investment. That is why people like Maxwell who used unit trust fund, became business tycoon. know also of many other people who became tycoons for using the is unit if trust funds. I then you hear of the success of Taiwan or Korea, it/for is nothing else but because those who undertake investments, do so through professional advice.what we are being told today, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, is that the Kenya Commercial/Bank, the national Bank, of Kenya, the Standard Bank and the rest are selling shares to wananchi. However, nobody seems to be organisations advising those who want to invest as to whether within a given time, these are going to make profits so that the investors can get dividends.MR.MAKAU (CTD.);If we pass this Sill, it will be easier to invest because people will not go round looking for companies that. are making profits by themselves. They will be able to use professionals who will have enough information as to where somebody should invest. Another incentive to businessmen is that by the time the investment √º is done, enough research would have been done on the same.There is one advantage in investing in Unit Trusts is that one is able to buy shares in companies and spend less than borrowing from commercial banks. These shares can be used as instruments of investment. As we attract people to invest in this country, the Office of the Vice- President and Ministry of Finance should give us a good basis for industrial and commercial take off. The Act of 1963 with regard to Unit Trusts has not been exploited fully.Some financial institutions make sure that they get in touch with every company operating within a given area and they know their likely profits. They are, therefore, able to give them advice. That is why the people who first entered this field failed. I would like to make an appeal that the Nairobi Stock Exchange should set up an operating area where people can trade in shares easily. They should also know that stock exchanges in the world are now very sophisticated. For example, one should be able to know that, at a given hour, if you buy shares in a certain company, he will be able to make profit. But the Nairobi Stock Exchange is like a "telephone stock exchange‚Äù where people meet in hotels and start talking about shares in specific companies. That is why I said that the Nairobi Stock Exchange should establish its own headquarters where shares can he traded openly.Another thing is that the Vice-President and Minister for Finance should look into the escalating mortgage interest rates in this country.MR.MAKAU (CTD.);We appreciate the fact that there is likely to be an international lie appreciate the fact that there is likely to _ recession due to the Gulf crisis but this should not be an excuse for increasing interest rates. Currently, the Government policy is to encourage Kenyans to own homes. But mortgage interests are so high that is now impossible for the ordinary Kenyan to own a house in urban centres. I would, therefore, like to appeal to the Vice-President and Minister for Finance fez to look into this problem of mortgage interest rates.Another problem that businessmen are facing in this country is what we call 'credit squeeze'. It has become impossible for businessmen to have access to credit. This has come about due to artificial creation of lack of funds. While-we appreciate-the fiscal policy that the Office of the Vice- President and Ministry of Finance has taken, a lot of companies are going under receivership because credit is not available. Treasury bonds are so attractive that one would rather invest there instead of extending credit to a businessman. There is high competition in this field and that is why those who would like to borrow money find it difficult to borrow from banks.We know that in order to curb inflation and control money supply, some of these measures are necessary. But we should, at the same time, think in terms of the interest of indigenous businessmen who are young in the field. If getting credit is so difficult, then the policy of encouraging indigenous people to enter business wills yield to naught, since in the long we will find ourselves having well established multi-nationals flourishing in this country.We should urge Kenyan owned banks to extend credit to upcoming businessmen on softer terms. We know they are doing this but the exercise should be intensified. then I was contributing to the Export Processing Zone Bill earlier on, I said that one problem we should investigate is with regard to what is causing receivership of companies in this country. A atola, company may forced into receivership due to poor management. If you look at firms which have borrowed money from the Kenya Industrial Estates, MR.MAKAU (CTD.);the industrial Development Bank or the Agricultural Finance Corporation, you will realise that, they have found it difficult to make ends meet and to repay the loans they acquired. This has come as a result of lack of obtaining credit from banks. We should, he very concerned about receiverships because once a company is received, it means creation of unemployment. We all know that unemployment is a crucial problem in this country. We have many graduates who have not yet secured employment. As we all know, the Government is already overburdened as far as payment of salaries to its workers is concerned.MR.MAKAU (CTD.);Considering that we now left with the private sector to absorb job-seekers, I suggest that a solution be found to the problems that are putting companies into receivership. Again financial institutions should ask themselves what they gain by putting companies under receivership. One strange thing in this country - which is not there in other countries - is that once a company is rat under receivership it never resumes business, even though the aim of putting a company under receivership is to revive it.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, financial institutions and banks...should move away, from the trend of appointing receiver managers to liquidate companies to appointing them to revive companies If a company is ailing marketing problems they should provide a qualified and good marketing manager; if it; is troubled by provide with a financial expert.I also suggest that the Vice President and Minister for Finance introduces a Bill in this House on bankruptcy similar to Chapter of the United States of America (USA). This Chapter 11 was used to put the Crislar? Corporation in the USA bank to business and this saved many jobs unemployment is the biggest problem that results from the liquidation of a business. This problem has been created in our country by liquidation of companies like J.K. Industries, East African Bag and Cordage and many others.When I talk of saving Businesses from being liquidated, √Ø also have state corporations in mind, because some have also been put under receivership. One such state corporations is the Kenya Ceramics Limited, which collapsed the company a flooded with .ceramics goods. It is obvious that if the market is flooded with 3 cheap imported goods, the organisation producing the same goods of better quality will collapse. Such a company can be save from collapsing by employing administrative measures to preventMR.MAKAU (CTD.);people from importing goods to compete with the locally manufactured ones.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have dwelt on liquidating companies because it has a bearing on our wish to attract investors into this country. If an investor wants to invest in carpet making and he hears that the only carpeting making company was liquidated some time back, then, no matter how much we convince such an investor, ne will doubt, whether is his goods will have market. This is why I have asked our financial institutions and other people concerned to understand what it means to put a company under receivership and eventually liquidate it.In stressing these points I urge hon. Members to support this Bill because it creates a good basis for Kenyans1 to be able to enter business and prosper¬ª This is because -unit trust is one of the best ways of investing because one gets professional advice and also one is sure of making profits.With those few remarks, I beg to support. </NEWSPEECH> <NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): If there is nobody else wishing to contribute, I call upon the Mover to reply. </NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Kariuki): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. First of all, I would like to congratulate all the hon. Members who have contributed to this very important Bill. I can assure all hon. Members that the points they have raised have been noted and, in the management of the Capital Market Authority, first of all, those to man it will be the best. We are very much aware of the point raised that it is‚Äô not the institutions we create that are important but that those institutions must be well managed. Therefore, I would like to assure hon. Members that we are very much aware of this aspect, that the efficiency of the institutions we create, the loyalty of the people who man these institutions is of paramount importance.Hon. Makau has mentioned the fact that in Nairobi, and Kenya in general, we have what we may call a telephone stock exchange. This may not be very adequate, but it is what we have at the moment. I would urge the five or six stock broking companies in Kenya to see to it that they are more open. They should not meet, as it were for coffee to decide on the values of shares or which company should go public and which should not. They should have an open floor where people could go and buy shares knowing the exact value of what they are buying and what alternatives exist in the market.In other words, the purpose of moving this Bill, if I may repeat, is to make trustworthy‚Äî It is important that a trust is what it is; trustworthy. Before the Act was enacted in 1987, the position was that anybody could register a unit trust with the Registrar of Societies. Once one had done that, he was free to do anything. He was, in fact, free even to abuse the provisions of the trust. So, what we are doing in moving this Bill is to make sure that these people are not that free; that they somehow know that somebody somewhere is watching over them so that they do not createTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VIE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Kariuki) (CTD.)a trust with a view to cheating the public. It is very easy for somebody to create a trust for the mere purpose of cheating the public. An individual can call a few people and tell them to contribute some money and they make a trust. Since the individual knows that he is under nobody's supervision, then how he uses the money that is entrusted to him is upon him. So, what we are doing here is to ensure that anybody who is managing a trust is answerable to an authority.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is Why at first we had thought that we could put this trust under the supervision of the Central Bank.THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Kariuki) (CTD.)	After creating unit trusts, we found that they were probably better institutions to overseer this kind of thing that any others. I might mention once again that the importance of these trusts is that investors will now feel more secure because they will not even have to risk all their money in one particular security or company. They will now be able to invest in various securities and companies under one trust, and whatever profits they get will not be subjected to corporation tax. If you were to form a company to own all these shares, whatever dividends you get would be liable to corporation tax, but this is not the case in as far as unit trusts are concerned.Various hon. Members have been complaining the high interest rates that are charged by banks and other financial institutions. It is not the wish of the Government that the public be charged high interest rates, but we must be factual. Interest is the price you pay for using money. Like the price of soap, food, and so on, the price of money depends on the question of supply and demand. If there was a lot of money in the market, interest rates would naturally go down, but when there is little money in the market, banks and other financial institutions have to offer those people with small savings high interest rates in order to pursuade them to put their money in fixed deposit and savings accounts. If banks and other financial institutions are going to offer their depositors high interest rates, consequently, they have to charge high interest rates to borrowers because there is no way in which they are going to pay high interest rates to depositors and not charge high interest rates to borrowers because this would be like saying that we are not going to increase the price of maize meal and yet we are going to pay farmers more for their maize.- This is neither possible nor practical. If we increase the price of maize, consequently, we have to increase the price of maize flour. The same thing applies to interest rates. This is all a question of supply and demand, and there is no way the Government can artificially bring interest rates down by passing a law in this Parliament. How do you charge, say, 12 per cent interest if you are paying depositors 16 per cent?THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Kariuki) (CTD.)One hon. Member here has also complained that interest rates are high in Kenya because the Government is giving very high interest rates in Treasury Bonds. I would like to inform the House that when the Government finds it necessary to borrow money from the market or the public, it does so just like anybody else. It has to be competitive because there is no way banks and other financial institutions are going to offer 15 per cent interest rates when the Treasury expects to get the same money at 14 per cent interest. So, when the Treasury gives 15 per cent interest on Treasury Bonds, it is just because this is the market rate. So, when we raise the interest rates payable on .Treasury.. Bonds, it is not that we want to kill financial institutions, but because we have to go to the market.With these few words, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.(Question put and agreed to)(The Bill was read a Second Time and committed to a Committee of the whole House tomorrow)<HEADER>ADJOURNMENT</HEADER>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Wabuge): Hon.

BIDU asked the Minister for Health, what plans does his Ministry have to supply electricity to Samburu Health Centre in Kinango Division.<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Dr. B.A Godana): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.I wish to inform the hon. Member that my Ministry is planning to supply electricity to Samburu Health Centre in Kinango Division when rural electrification programme begins in the area. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Assistant Minister for his reply, but/since that Health Centre is- a lot of work and the electricity passes just overhead, he tell this House what prompt action y be taken in to fit electricity inside ? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. B.A. GODANA: According to the information that we have the nearest electricity lines are at Mariakani, which is 15 kilometres away, and the Ministry is therefore waiting for the rural electrification exercise to reach Kinango Division so that electricity can be supplied to the Health Centre. As soon as that is done, Kinango, according to the localDistrict Development committee (DDC) of which the hon. Member is a member. will be supplied with electricity after Lungwe Division As DR. B.A. GODANA (CTD.)soon as the electricity reaches the area, we shall take the lines to the Health Centre. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the Assistant Minister is talking of rural electrification, he is saying that the nearest place that we can be provided with electrictiy is Mariakani. I come from the area and I know that there is a railway station which has electricity. Also power lines from Uganda pass over that Health Centre, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Why did the Ministry not take the electricity lines to the Health Centre when it was being built? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. B.A. GODANA: Yes, the Ministry did plan and in fact, right now it is working on the Bill of Quantities for us. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MAKHANU: Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Arising from the Assistant Minister's reply and knowing that rural electrification programme is a different programme and that funds may be delayed because of the project going on in Samburu, could he therefore, assure this House that the Ministry will have a generator installed at Samburu Health Centre because people need electricity? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. B.A. GODANA: I am sure hon. Makhanu being a former District Commissioner, knows about limitations and capabilities of Ministries to get expensive equipments like a generator just out of hand. The point is that we are planning to electrify the place, through the rural electrification programme and it is really up to the hon. Member and other leaders in the area to arrange their priorities properly if they want this particular Health Centre to get electricity earlier than the DDC envisages. I cannot promise that we willDR. B.A. GODANA (CTD.)provide a generator, but I can promise that we shall do everything possible to ensure that not withstanding the need to have generator or electricity in the Health Centre, the people of the area will not be deprived of any of the services that they need. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MWAMZANDI: Will the Assistant Minister tell us if it is his Ministry's policy not to install electricity to an institution, unless there is rural electrification programme despite that the programme. that he is talking about might take another ten years? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. B.A. GODANA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, no, it is not our Ministry's plan not to install generators unless rural electrification programme is started in a place. The hon. Member surely has enough experience to know that there are areas of this country which are programmed to get rural electrification in the shortest possible Lime. In this particular case, we expect it in one to two years.There are other areas where we cannot envisage to get rural electrification programme to cover some health centres and dispensaries in the next ten years. In those latter cases, we will have to think seriously of providing generators; that is what we are doing. In this case the rural electrification exercise has already began and it is only a question of priorities because the Kwale DDC which has not made this their first priority. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE SPEAKER: Next Question, Mr. Momanyi. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MWAMZANDI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir, The Assistant Minister says that rural electrification programme for that area has already been planned, although he is not the Minister responsible for electricity.

SPEAKER: Mr. Momanyi, Next Question. </NEWSPEECH>Question No. 526 Tea Payment to Mr. David OkiomaMR. MOMANY asked the Minister for Agriculture, when Mr. David O. Okioma of Nyasiongo Tea Factory, NS. 200247, will be paid his second payment of 1987.<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINSITER FOR AGRICULTURE (Mr. Gachui):Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. Mr. David Okioma of Nyansiongo Tea Factory, number 200247 , could not be paid his second payment because he owed the factory funds in excess of payment made earlier in his 1986 payment. Until his arrears are recovered, he will not be able to be paid any funds from the factory. After the arrears are recovered, the payments will be made to him for the tea leaves which we would have delivered to the factory. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MOMANYI: How, will these farmers know that they owe the factory some money, unless they are told. Can the Assistant Minister order the KTDA to inform these people what is required of them because they are really suffering. They keep on weighing their tea every morning waiting for payments which they do not see. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. GACHUI: I think the farmers would be aware of the overpayments, because they arose out of the payment of kilos in excess of what they had delivered and what was being recovered was the excess. As long as they continue to deliver additional kilos of tea and the excess is recovered, then the balance will be paid to them directly. They can obtain this information from their respective tea factories. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MAKHANU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, for information of this House, could the Assistant Minister tell us, how much this farmer owed that factory paid for the second payment so, that we can know if there is any balance either way? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. GACHUI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not have the figures right now. but I can promise to provide them today this afternoon or anytime this week. </NEWSPEECH>	THE SPEAKER: Next Question,Question No. 556Tea Gowing Possibility In KapenguriaMR.

BIDU, on behalf of Mr. Kubo asked the Minister for Transport and Communications, whether he could direct the Kenya Railways Corporation to waive the fine imposed on passengers who obtain their tickets in the train between Voi - Mwatate - Bura - Mwikitau and Taveta, since in most of the cases tickets are not available at the stations. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS(Dr. P.K. Momanyi): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The Corporation does not permit surchaging of passengers who join train at designated between stations. TheTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Dr. P.K. Momanyi) (CTD.)surchage is imposed only in those cases where passengers deliberately avoid paying the normal fares.On rare occasions when printed card tickets are not available at any of our stations, paper fare tickets are issued and no fine is imposed on passengers buying such tickets. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>KR. BIDU: While thanking the Assistant Minister for his reply, I would like him to note that this happens even on days when there are not tickets in the railway station. Could he new assure the House that system will stop? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. P.K. MOMANYI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I repeat that the Corporation does not In any case, if a passenger boards a train at a station offering tickets, such as Voi or Taveta, and he slips into the train without buying a ticket, he is fined for that offence. If the hon. Member knows of any cases where people have been wrongly fined, he should bring them forward so that disciplinary action could be taken. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the existing practice is that people are normally fined. Does the Assistant Minister mean to say that these people have been fined illegally? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR.

On 1st July, 1984, he was absorbed into the head office payroll on temporary terms. Mr. Sawe retired from Government service as a subordinate staff under temporary terms of service and did not qualify for pension in accordance with the Pensions Act. However, Mr. Sawe is entited to N.S.S.F. benefits, for which he can apply direct to the Director of the N.S.S.F. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.

P.K. MOMANYI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, this depends on the type of work such a person is given. Mr. Sawe was employed first in 1970 on workspaid DR. P.K. MOMANYI (CTD.)terms, meaning that he would be paid at the end of a week or at the end of the job he would be given. However, in 1984, he was taken in temporarily and had to complete, at least, two years before he could be placed on permanent terms. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. CHEPKOK: Mr. Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister read out the Ministry letter ref. No. 771611/1? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. P.K.

You will, however, be paid your retirement benefits under the National Social Security Fund Act". Please, contact the Director of the National Social Security Fund for further information." </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. CHEPKOK: Mr. Speaker, Sir, this letter refer to 1966 while the Assistant Minister has told the House that Mr. Sawe was employed in 1970. Which of the two sides is correct? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. P.K. MOMANYI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me make it clear that if you were employed in 1970, ipso facto, you were obviously employed after 1966. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. CHEPKOK: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I still disagree with the Assistant Minister. Could he read out the whole letter so that the House could know what it means? This man was employed and promoted later to a certain level at which he was entitled to payment of pension. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. P.K.

This is not promotion. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.

SPEAKER: Hon. Galgallo not here? Next Question. </NEWSPEECH>Question No. 559Fixed Assets of The N.S.S.F.MR. KILIKU asked the Minister for Labour what are the fixed assets of the N.S.S.F. and how members do benefit from these assets.<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. D.M. Amin): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The N.S.S.F., like other organizations, has fixed assets in the form of land and buildings, motor vehicles, offices, equipment, office furniture, fittings and furnishings. These fixed assets have been acquired mainly to facilitate the provision of services to the members as well as to generate income. The information on the type of fixed assets of the N.S.S.F. is as follows:-The xxx N.S.S.F. has two undeveloped plots; one in Nairobi which measures 12.84 acres and the other in Mombasa of 1.25 acres. The Fund intends to develop these plots as soon as other assets generate enough funds to develop them.-The N.S.S.F. has two commercial buildings in Nairobi and Mombasa. Both are partly used for the N.S.S.F. services and also for renting. The Nairobi building houses all N.S.S.F. headquarters staff and the remaining offices are rented by the Ministry of Labour at KShs.160,000/- per month. The Mombasa building accommodates our staff and the rest of the offices are rented to various people at KShs.500-000/- per month. These funds are -used to repay the initial outlay. It is estimated that these commercial "buildings will repay themselves in 15 to .20 years time implying that the initial capital will be brought back to members account. THE ASSISTANT MINISTER POR LABOUR (Mr. D.M. Amin) (CTD.);Mr. Speaker, Sir, recently the N.S.S.F. acquired 15 maisonettes at Buru and and 220 units at Kibera high rise building scheme for housing its own staff These houses are still new and not yet occupied.- However, a policy is being worked out regarding the conditions of occupying these houses.MR. KILLKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while appreciating the explanation given by the Assistant Minister	The Assistant Minister did not explain how the retired Fund members benefit from these assets. They must benefit from these assets apart from their normal retirement benefits.MR. D.M. ALIEN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I said earlier that these rents are used to repay the initial financial outlay. It is estimated that these commercial but 1 dings will repay themselves in 15 to 20 years. This implies that the initial capital will be brought back to members account and members will benefit after the buildings have fully repaid themselves. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKU: Could the Assistant Minister assure us that when a retiring contributor is getting his money, his shares from these fixed assets will be shown on the payslip? This is because the Fond use the contributors money to construct these buildings. So, could the Assistant Minister make sure that apart from the interest paid to the retiring Fund members they should also get their shares from these buildings; no matter how small the amounts are? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we shall take care of that. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Mr. Bidu's Question. </NEWSPEECH>Question Ho.470Payment of Mr. Dzombo's Death GratuityMR. BIDU asked the Minister for Environment and Natural Resources why the Mr. Ministry has not paid death gratuity benefits to the family of the late Mr. Ali Dzuha Dzombo, P.P. No.022110, formerly working with the Forests Department, Mombasa.<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER POR ENVIRONMENT AND Z NATURAL RESOURCES (Mr. Muregi): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The late Mr. Ali Dzuha Dzombo was a member of Subordinate Staff with my Ministry, serving on non-pensionable terms of service from the time of his appointment on 2nd May, 1979, until the time of his death on 25"th November, 1989. However, the late Mr. Dzombo qualifies for benefits under the N.S.S.P. programme </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the beneficiaries have not been paid since 1989, when Mr. Dzombo died. They filled all the necessary forms and they have visited the Ministry's office in Mombasa many times. Does the Assistant Minister believe that his officers in Mombasa have given him correct information regarding this matter? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MUREGI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the truth of the matter is that there has been some delay in the completion of Forms SF23 and SP32. However, my Ministry gave instructions to the officers in the field to contact the family and have these forms completed. This was done on 3rd October, 1990. As soon as these forms are received they will be processed and the family will be paid accordingly. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. EIPKORIR: What has the Ministry been doing since Mr. Dzombo passed away? What has caused this long delay. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>Mr. MUREGI: Mr. Speaker, Sir. this delay was caused "by the failure or part of the family of the deceased to follow the laid down procedure in claiming the death gratuity benefits. However, as soon as my Ministry learned scout this delay, ice sent officers to advise the second of kin and asked them to fill in the appropriate forms. So, this is what caused the delay otherwise, there has not been any deliberate move on part of my Ministry to delay these payments. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. EIPKORIR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, why should the Assistant Minister blame the family of the deceased for their ignorance in following the proper procedure of filling in forms? was it not the duty of the ministry in the first place to advise these people on what to do. Why should they blame ignorant people, in the local community for something which they themselves ought to blame? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>Mr. MUREGI : Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not know why hon. Koririr forgets about the problems that follow after somebody dies. The most difficult problem is in to identify the rightful heir of estate, property or benefits of the deceased person which is/great concern to my Ministry. However, we also have chiefs and district officers who. should assist the Ministry in identifying the rightful heir of such benefits, property or estates¬ª Therefore, this delay should not to blamed on my Ministry hut as I have said, when we noticed this kind of delay, are instructed our officers on the ground to advise the family of the deceased on what to do. In the course of sorting out this problem of the rightful heir, we found that more delay was inevitable. Therefore, I would like to inform the hon. Member that it is important to consider these and other problems that arise after somebody dies. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.BIDU : Mr. Speaker, Sir, I quite agree with hon. Kipkorir that the Ministry should be blamed for the delay in releasing- these benefits. The Assistant Minister tells the House that his Ministry sent officers to advise, the family of the deceased, could ho tell us what evidence he has to prove to this House that they actually did send these officers? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MUREGI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I said that my officers assisted the family of the deceased to fill in Form S.F./23 and do Lave duplicate copies of these forms. However, I would like to say - - - </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the Assistant-Minister starts talking about forms, is he aware that these forms were filled in a long time ago. Me would like to know what other evidence he has to prove to us that his Ministry has been following up this issue by instructing their officers in Mombasa to assist the family of the deceased to follow up these payments. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MUREGI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the efficiency of my officers in Mombasa gives me the confidence that they did their best to assist the family of the deceased. Besides Forms S.F/23 and S.F./32, other documents were also required and the failure to make these documents available on part of the family of the deceased also caused this delay. For example, we have the death certificate, M.S.S.F. membership card and so on. My Ministry could not get these documents in any way unless they were surrendered by the family of the deceased. This is what caused the delay and I wish the hon. Member was a Member of Parliament at that time. I am sure he could have been of some assitance to the family of the deceased person. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, now that 1) e Assistant Minister has agreed that all the necessary7 documents have been received, could he tell the Excuse when he expects this money to be paid to the family of the deceased? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MUREGI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as soon as possible. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Are you satisfied with that reply of "As soon as possible?" I am asking this because "As soon as possible" could mean even after ter. years. "Would the Assistant Minister tell us exactly when this money will be paid to the beneficiaries? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MUREGI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I cannot give the exact date now because it is not the responsibility of my Ministry to process those documents. we have given out all the necessary information. to the N.S.S.F. and knowing how efficient the K.S.S.F. is, I am sure they are going to pay and this is why I am using the words, "As soon as possible". As the hon. Member knows , as soon as the cheque is made it will be sent either to the district officer or to the district commissioner and the beneficiaries will collect it from there. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Can we go back to Mr. Lewa's Question. </NEWSPEECH>Question No.541 Issuance of Trade Test Certificate to Mr. Wangau<NEWSPEECH>MR. LEWA: asked the Minister for Technical Training and Applied Technology when his Ministry will issue Mr. Charo Katana Wangau his Painter Grade III Certificate Mo.96516, which was awarded to him in 1533. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TECHNICAL TRAINING AND APPLIED TECHNOLOGY (Mr. Leakey): Mr. Speaker, Sir, first of all, I would like to apologize to the Mouse for not having been here to answer this Question when it was first called. Having said that, I beg to reply.A Government Trade Test Certificate Mo.96916 in the name of Mr. Charo Matara wangau was prepared and mailed to the Labour Officer, P.O. Box 90361, Mombasa on 9th .May, 1983. The candidate was notified to report to the Labour Officer, Mombasa on or after 1st August, 1983 so that the certificate could be issued to him. The notification was issued to Mr. Charo Katana wangau at the address he had indicated on the application form, namely, C/O Charo Ngao, P.C. Box 49 Kilifi.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Mr. Charo Katana wangau should present himself to the Labour Office, Mombasa to obtain his certificate. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. LEWA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the truth of the matter is that there is no certificate to be collected in Nombasa. I am saying this because quite a lot of things have happened between 19S3 and now. I appreciate the Ministry of Technical Training and Applied Technology was started only in 1938 and by that time, the provincial labour officer, Mombasa had written several letters to the Director of national Industrial Vocational Training Centre, Nairobi to forward a duplicate certificate to Mombasa. In one of these letters, there was Shs.lOO/- money order and a copy of Katana's Identity Card. Since then the Director has done nothing and therefore, the truth of the matter is that there is no certificate to be collected in Mombasa. Could the Assistant Minister therefore produce the certificate in question? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>Mr. LEAKEY: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not aware of what the hon. Bhat the certificate was misplaced member is saying but it is quite possible as he rightly says I since my Ministry was not in existence at the time in question. It is unfortunate that it has taken seven years for Mr. Katana to ask his Member of Parliament to look for this certificate. However, my Ministry would be more than happy to try and solve this problem and if we can find a copy of the certificate since the original has been misplaced, we would be only too glad to produce it. Perhaps the hon. Member would like to come to our I office so that we can sort of out this problem together. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.LEWA: Speaker. Sir, am I made to understand by the Assistant Minister that the Director of National Industrial Vocational Training Centre is, in fact, part of his staff? He is the culprit and is the one who was delaying the release of this certificate. If I go to the Director's office will I find this gentleman or I will be referred to the Ministry of Labour and eventually to the Ministry of Technical Training and Applied Technology? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>13. LEAKEY: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I said earlier, the office of the Director is now under my Ministry and we will certainly assist the hon. Member in solving this problem. He can, therefore, come to our office and we will direct him to the Director's office. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR, SPEAKER: Next Question. </NEWSPEECH>Question No. 366 Payment of Retirement Benefits to Mr. Mohamad, MR. SPEAKER: Mr. Galgallo is still not in? (Question dropped)Next Order.<HEADER>QUESTIONS BY PRIVATE NOTICE</HEADER>Sacking of workers by M/S Earamayn Industries Limited<NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister forLabour the following Question by Private Notice.(a)	Why did the management of M/S. Earamayn Industries Limited of P.O. Box 83062, Mombasa, close the company and terminated the services of all the workers witout notice?(b)	"When will these former employees be paid their terminal benefits? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MAKHANU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Before theAssistant Minister responds to this Question, I wish to draw the attention of the Chair to the fact that part (a) of the Question if is poorly constructed; the English language used there is not the one we are used to. The word"terminated" should read "terminate". </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: That is correct. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. D.M. Amin):Mr. Speaker, Sir I beg to reply.M/S. Haramayn Industries Limited Mombasa, is a textile manufacturing company operating within the Kenya Industrial Estates Limited. Due to financial and other operational constraints, the company 2JE was put under receivership on 24th July, 1990. The receiver, Mr. Yusuf Abraham Twahir. appointed by the Kenya Industrial Estates, closed the company on 31st July. 1990. By that time, the company had a total of 23 employees engaged in various jobs. All of them were members of Tailors and Textile Workers Union. Immediately thereafter, the Union informed the Labour Officer Mombasa, of the closure of the company. Subsequent investigations by the Labour. Officer, Mombasa, have revealed that all employees were paid their wages up to the time of the close of the company by the receivers.with regard to other benefits, it is important to note that the company is now under receivership and their terminal benefits will, therefore be determined by the official receiver. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKU: Sir, when this company was closed, its management ran away without informing the workers that they had closed down. When the workers went to the company, they found offices closed. I agree with the Assistant Minister that these workers will be paid by the official receiver. Could he tell this House how long it will take the official receiver to complete processing the payment of these workers so that they can be paid? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.D.M AMIN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as soon as the official receiver gets money, these people will be paid. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MWAMZANDI: Arising from the Assistant Minister's reply, can be tell us the names of the directors of this company? If these directors have connections outside this country, can he agree with me that they could have applied for loans, syphoned the money outside this country and declared themselves bankrupt? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. D.M. AMR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not have the names of the directors with me, but I will look for them and inform the House accordingly next week. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the Assistant Minister assure this House that when funds become available, the workers would be paid first before any other creditor is considered? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. D.M. AMIN: As soon as the official receiver gets money, the workers will be paid. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKU: Can the Assistant Minister outline the benefits these workers will receive? Will they, for example, be compensated for termination of their services without notice, preference fees, leave due and so on? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the workers received their salaries, they will now be compensated according to their entitlement. I am sorry I do not have a list of benefits to be received by these workers. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Next Question </NEWSPEECH>Release of 1990 Mungwo School K.C.P.E.

KILIKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, what is "next time"? Can the Assistant Minister be specific? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Karauri): Mr. Speaker, Sir, "next time" means the next time the Question appears on the Order Paper. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the next time we are going to have another Order Paper is this afternoon. Is he going to respond this afternoon? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Karauri): Mr. Speaker, Sir PaperI am sure the hon.

SPEAKER: Next Question.PIot for Kinyanjui Township 'Jua Kali Artisans </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. P.K. KINYANJUI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Lands and Housing the following Question by Private Notice.(a) What is delaying the allocation of a plot to 'jua kali' artisans at Kikuyu Township?(b) What action has the Minister taken on the letter sent to the Ministry by the Kiambu District Planning Officer on 4th June, 1990? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER POR LANDS AND HOUSING (Mr. Bomett): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(a) My Ministry is still processing the necessary documents for allotment and the matter will be finalised soon after the illegal structures at the site are removed. I would like to request the hon. Member and the local administration to assist the Ministry on this.(b) The letter dated 4th June, 1990 from the Kiambu District Physical Planning. Officer was received by my Ministry and action is being taken as I have stated above. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. P.K. KINYANJUI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while thanking the Assistant Minister. for his reply, I would like to assure him that the local people have already done their part and the D.D.C. has approved the allocation of this plot. His officers have already seen this plot. would he assure this House that this plot which is measuring 0.44 hectares will not be interfered with? we understand that there are some private people who want to claim this plot. Would he, therefore, assure this House that the earmarked plot for jua kali artisans will not be interfered with? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BOMETT: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the answer to this question is positive and we support the hon. Member and the D.D.C. very much. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. P.K. K√úNYAMJUI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the letter referred to in the Question,  It was sent to the Ministry on 4th June, 1990. This letter indicated that this matter was urgent. Can the Assistant Minister tell us what has delayed action on this letter? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BOMETT: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I did mentions that the only set back is that there are some people living there in illegal structures. We would like the Adiministration, in conduction with local leaders, to get rid of these people so that work can start right away and we give the jua kali artisans letters of allotment, whom we support very much. In fact, if the hon. Member can take some of these people to the Ndeiya Scheme, this will solve the problem. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. WASIKEDOMBI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister now not misleading the House by saying the local Administration should first of all get rid of people from the plots the letters of allotment are given? In normal cases, the letters of allotment are given according to how the plots have been demarcated. Is he not using that kind explanation as an excuse and, therefore, misleading the House? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BOMETT: Mr. Speaker, Sir, far from it I do not say that we will give the allotment letters; I said that after the removal of these illegal structures we will do the job. </NEWSPEECH><HEADER>POINTS OF ORDER</HEADER><NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Of late we have not been receiving written answers. I am appealing to the Ministers to be submitting enough copies of their written replies to the National Assembly and the National Assembly Administration should ensure that we get the written replies before the Questions are asked in the House. Thank you, Sir. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Amayo): On apoint of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Last week on Wednesday when answering a Question raised by hon. Chepkok, a dispute arose as to whether a Mr. Kipruto Joel Chirchir left for the Soviet Union as an SI, or a graduate, teacher. I promised to bring to this House documents to prove that Mr. Chirchir left as an SI teacher, having graduated from the Kenya Science Teachers College (KSTC) and not from the University of Nairobi. I wish, therefore, to lay the documents on the Table. </NEWSPEECH>(Hon. Amayo laid the documents on the Table)<NEWSPEECH>MR. CHEPKOK: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The student wrote to me from the Soviet Union asking me to raise this matter in the House and he informed me that he went there as a post graduate student. I am thus following what the student inform me. In any case, can the Assistant Minister say that a graduate of KSTC is not like any other graduate? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Mr. Chepkok, that man is only a graduate of the KSTC.Next order<HEADER>MOTION</HEADER>Naming of "KAYA FORESTS" at the Coast MR. BODY: Bw.Spika, naomba kupendekeza Hoja ifuatayo:KWAMBA, Kwa vile wananchi wa Mkoa wa Pwani wamejitengea aina mbali ya "KAYA" kama hifadhi zao (sehemu maalum kwa maombi na kuabudu) na hiku ikikumbukwa ya kwamba mipango ya hapoawali ya kuzigawanya ekari themanini na saba za "KAYA WAA" kwa watu binafsi kulileta mizozo mingi; Bunge hili lapeidekesa kuwa "KAYA" zote zisiandikishwe kwa majina ya mabaraza ya Serikali za wilaya, bali ziandikishwe kwa majina yao binafsi na ziwe sehemu za kutumiwa na watu wote.(Public Prayer Meeting Areas)MR. BOY (CTD.)Bw. Spika, "watu wengi wanashangaa "kaya" nin nini. Kwa manufao ya watu hao, nitaeleza "Kaya" nin nini. Wakati mashamba yalipokuwa yanagawanywa na Serikali wananchi walijenga sehemu maalum kama za shule na maombi. Kule Pwani kulikuwa na sehemu maalum ambako wananchi na kuomba na sehemu hizo zinaitwa ‚ÄúKaya‚Äù. Kaya nyingine ni kubwa na nyingine ni ndogo; Kwa sababu ya desturi za Wamijikenda "Kaya" zimeenea katika Mkoa wa Pwani wote.Nimeileta Hoja hii kwa sababu ya matatizo yaliyotokana na "Kaya Waa" , yenye eneo la karibu ekari 89 na ambalo liko Karibu ufuo wa bahari (yaani beach) Sasa mwaka 1988/89 watu wakubwa waliigawanya "Kaya Yaa" na hata mimi nikapewa ekari mbili ili nisililalamikie jambo hilo. Lakini Kwa sababu ninataka kurudishwa Bungeni wakati mwingine nilizikataa ekari hizo nbili na kulipinga jambo hili.NinamshukuruMkuu Wilaya wa Kwale wakati huo, Bw. Mbuo Waganangwa,kwa..sababu alituunga mkono na ingawa hati za kumilki ploti hizo zilikuwa zimetolewa zilibatilishwa.Sasa swala ni kwamba kwa vile "Kaya." iko katika jina la baraza la Vilaya, bado inaweza kugawanywa tena. Nataka kusema kwamba watu wa Pwani wana imani fulani kuhxisina na "Kaya" hizi: utaona kwamba. sehemu hizi zina miti maalum ya zamani ya kipekee ambayo imehiiadhiwa, na watu huenda hapo kulingana na kanuni zilizowekwa tangu Zamani. MR. BOY (CTD.)Hivi majuzi usimamizi was sehemu hiyo ya Kaya uligeuzwa, baada ya wananchi kufanya makelele na mbinu zikafaulu kuwa usimamizi huo uwe chini ya Konseli ya Kwale. Hivi nisemavyo, Konseli ya Kwale ina mipango ya kupakodisha mahali hapo na pajengwe mahoteli ya watalii. Sasa masilahi ya wananchi hayati liwi maanani tena. Kwa sasa wakubwa wana tamaa ya kuwa na ploti ya baha rini lakini si sawa kuwa wakubwa hawa watazitwaa ploti ambazo zimetengwa na wananchi kwa nia fulani.Huko Diani, karibu na Golden Beach, kuna msikiti unaojulikana kama Kongo Mosque na ni wa zamani sana. Uiikuwa umejengwa kwenye eneo la ekari kumi, lakini wakubwa fulani wamejigawia kidogo kidogo mpaka sasa sehemu iliyobaki ni ile ya msikiti wenyewe tu hivi kwamba hakuna nafasi nyingine ya kukatwa. Kama si Wizara ya Mambo ya Nchini, nafikiri hata msikiti wenyewe ungekatwa na hali hiyo ni sehemu ambayo ilitengwa na wananchi kuhifadhiwa kwa maombi tangu zamani za kale.Hoja hii inasema kwamba kama wananchi walijitengea mahali hapo pa Kaya Waa, basi paanaikishwe kwa jina hilo. Kama pametengwa chini ya jina Kaya Fungo, ama Kaya Chonyi, basi paandikishwe hivyo kusudi kuwazuia wale wakubwa wakubwa ambao wanazunguka sehemu hizo wakitafuta ploti za baharini. Hatukatai kuwa watu wapate ploti zilizo karibu na bahari, kwa kuwa hata mimi nikipewa moja nitaichukua, lakini isiwe ni katika sehemu ya Kaya Waa. Kama ninapatiwa ploti mahali panapofaa kutolewa ploti za aina hiyo, basi niria haki ya kuitwaa, lakini si katika mahali palipotengwa kama Kaya Waa.Jambo lingine ambalo ni la muhimu katika mambo haya ya Kaya ni kwamba hii ni hifadhi ya kutumiwa na vizazi vijavyo hivi kwamba vizazi hivyo vitaweza kusoma historia yao. Unaposikia Miji Kenda, ni kabila moja lakini kuna tofautitofauti huko ya vijikabila tisa. Kuna Mdigo, Mgiriama, Mchonyi, Mkambe, Mkauma, Mduruma na kadhalika. Kila nmoja wa hao wana kaya yao. Mchonyi ana Kaya Fungo Mgiriama ana Kaya Giriama; Mdigo ana Kaya Digo na kadhalika Lakini kwa sababu kuna hii tamaa ya ploti, basi kaya hiziMR. BOY (CTD.)zinanyemelewa sana. Kuna ushahidi kuwa Kaya Waa imegawanywa na shahada za kumiliki ardhi kutolewa. Waziri, ama Waziri Msaidizi atakayesimama kujibu anafaa kusema kama nisemavyo ni uwongo.Bw. Spika, ikiwa hivi majuzi Kaya Waa hiyo iligawanywa na tuka fanya makel ele, je, kesho wakati pengine Boy hatakuweko itakuwaje? Si basi itagawanywa zaidi? Huu ni mtego wa panya unaosemekana huingia walio kuwemo na wasiokuwemo. Kwa sasa ambapo watu fulani wanaziotea ploti hizo, wanasema kuwa Kaya Waa ibaki vile vile kusudi mambo yakishapoa na vidomo vidomo kuond√≥ka, wakubwa hao watanyemelea pole pole. Utaona ploti moja imetolewa kwa mtu fulani, ekari moja, mbili na kadhalika mpaka ardhi hiyo yote itolewe kwa watu binafsi. Mfano ni wa konseli fulani ambazo huwa zimepatiwa usimamizi wa ploti za makanisa, mashule na kadhalika, na baada ya muda fulani unaona kwamba ploti hizo zimeuziwa watu binafsi. Hii ndiyo sababu tunataka mahali popote ambapo pametengwa kwa maslahi ya uirena, basi shahada ya kumiliki ardhi itolewe kwa jina kama la shule na kadhalika. Huku kunyakua ploti kila mahali kutakuja kufanya hata ploti zilizojengewa shule ziuzwe pia.Hatukatai watu fulani kupata ploti. Yafaa nieleweke kwamba sisemi watu wasipewe ploti, lakini wakizipata zisiwe ni zile zilizotengwa kwa sababu maalum. Waswahili husema usipoziba ufa utajenga ukuta. Ufa huwa ni mdogo sana lakini usipozibwa unazidi na kuwa mkubwa na mwisho nyumba inaanguka. Ninawaomba Wabunge wenzangu tusaidiane tuuzibe ufa huu ambao tusipouziba tutajenga ukuta. Wengi wetu hapa tuna sehemu kama hizi ninazozungumzia ambazo zimetengwa katika sehemu fulani katika mawakilisho. Ikiwa basi tutayaacha mambo kwenda mrama hivi, basi itakuwa kwamba baada ya kurudi kwenye uchaguzi wa mlolongo, tutaona makoti mapya hapa. Utaona jasho likiwatoka watu wengine kama maji na hata benaera zitaondolewa kwa watu fulani pia. Ni vizuri tufanye jitihada na wananchi wajionee kuwa tunajaribu kupigania hifadhi ya vitu vilivyo muhimu Kwao.MR. BOY (CTD.)Bw. Spika, ikiwa hujapigwa na mvua, basi huwezi kushtuka ukiambiwa utapigwa na mvua, kwa sababu hujui mvua itakupigaje. Maana yake ni kwamba nimepigika mwenyewe. Nawaomba Wabunge wenzangu tujihadhari mapema. Waswa hili pi a wanasema kuwa fisi akimla mgonjwa, mzima afunge mlango. Kwangu nina shida ya Kaya kuanza kugawanywa. Hapa Bungeni kuna wawakilishi wa wananchi kutoka Ndhiwa, Kwanza, Samburu, Eldoret, Kericho na kadhalika. Huko kote pi a kuna sehemu fulani ambazo zimetengwa. Basi jambo la muhimu ni kuwa mahali kama hapo palipotengwa pabaki hivyo. Tukiliachilia swali hili hivi hivi, basi mambo yatakuwa mabaya. Tutakuja kuulizwa na wananchi ardhi waliyoitenga kwa nia maalum imekwenda wapi.Nikitoa mfano, Kaya Waa ilipogawanywa, wananchi walizipata habari hizo na mikutano ya mkuu wa wilaya na ya chifu ikagomewa. Watu waligombana Kwale nzima kwa kuwa walikuwa wamepata fahamu kuwa mahali pao walipopatenga palikuwa pametwaliwa. Wapinzani. wa kisiasa, na hawa wale ambao macho yao yako kwenye uchaguzi wa 1993 walianza kutoa uwongo kwamba Bw. Boy ndiye aliyekuwa ameigawanya Kaya Waa. Huu ni mtego wa panya unaoingia waliokuwemo na wasiokuwemo. Haya ni mambo muhimu si kwetu tu bali kwa wananchi na pia kwa mazingira yetu. Pia tunafaa kufahamu kuwa hifadhi kama hizi haziihusu sehemu ya Kwale peke yake. Hii ni shida iliyo kil a mahali kwamba sehemu ya ardhi ambayo imetengwa mahali fulani kwa maendeleo fulani inatolewa na kupewa wananchi binafsi. Hilo ndilo jambo ninalosema hapa.MR. BOY (CTD.)Kwa hivyo, tunachosema ni kwamba Hoja hii ni wazi kabisa. Nikisema kwamba koti hili ni langu, maneno mengi ni ya nini? Ikiwa mwananchi fulani ametenga mahali fulani na kusema, "Hapa pawe kaya", shida yatoka wapi? Mbona watu wamekuwa werevu namna hii? Wakati wa ugawaji wa ardhi, mwananchi mwenyewe alitoa sehemu hii kwa kupenda kwake, lakini leo watu wengine hapa Nairobi ndio wamekuwa na uwezo mkubwa juu ya sehemu hii kuliko mwananchi mwenyewe. Hii ni aibu. Jambo hili limezidi sana na haliwezekani. Tungetaka Nairobi iendelee kuwa na uwezo juu ya ardhi ya Serikali. Ikiwa mwananchi alitenga sehemu fulani kwa minajili fulani, taabu iko wapi anapotaka kupatumia mahali hapo kwa minajili hiyo? Inasemekana kwamba konseli ndiyo iliyopewa mamlaka ya ardhi ya ununa, huku ikasahaulika kwamba konseli hii ikikaa itapitisha kwamba mahali hapo pachukuliwe, na patachukuliwa. Hapo itakuwa kama kutoka mdomoni mwa simba na kuingia mdomoni mwa chui. Kamati ya kugawa mashamba ikiikosa sehemu hii, iliitoa kwa konseli, nayo konseli inafikiria kumpa mzungu ill. ajenge hoteli ya ufuoni mwa bahari. Hii ni dhambi. Huku ni kumwonea mwananchi.Ikiwa tunataka kutafuta pesa, tunafaa kufanya hivi pole pole. Hapana haja ya kutafuta pesa huku tukimtia mchanga machoni mwenye pesa hizo. Jambo hili halifai. Hivi sasa tunamtia mwananchi mchanga machoni eti kwa sababu tunatafuta pesa. Tunafaa kupunguza mbio zetu kwa sababu mbio tunazofanya sasa hivi za kilomita 900 kwa saa hazifai. Haifai kuja na mzungu na kumpa mahali ambapo mwananchi amepatenga kwa minajili fulani. Siku hizi kuna mtindo mpya wa kusema kwamba'mahali fulani hapauzwi, bali panakodishwa tu kwa muda wa miaka 999. Ikiwa hivi, basi mimi nitakufa na hata mtoto wangu afe kabla hajarudishiwa mahali pake.Hata huenda Yesu akarudi kabla wakati huu haujaisha. Huu ni ujanja mtupu.Tuko hapa kuongea kwa niaba ya wananchi. Tumcapa na kusema kwamba hatuna kazi nyingine katika Bunge hili ila kuongea kwa niaba ya wananchi. Kila mhe. Mbunge anayesimaina hapa kuongea, huwa anafanya hivyo kwa niaba ya wananchi wake. Kwa hivyo, ninaongea hapa kwa niaba ya watu wa Matuga ambao ndio valionileta hapa kuwatetea. Watu hawa wanatiwa mchanga machoni kwa sababu wanaambiwa kwanba ploti walizotenga ziwe kaya zitakodishwa.(Mr. Speaker left the Chair)(The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Wabuge) took the Chair)Wanaambiwa kwamba hawapokonywi ploti hizo, bali ni zao tu, lakini zinakodishwa kwa Wazungu ili wajenge hoteli za ufuoni mwa bahari kwa muda wa miaka 999. Waheshimiwa tfabunge walio hapa ni a gredi na wanajua kuwawakilisha wananchi kwa kuwa wako macho huku wakiendelea kuwatetea wananchi wakati wote. Waheshimiwa Wabunge hawa ni kabambe kabisa na wanajulikana kote katika Afrika Mashariki na Kati. Ni matumaini yangu kwamba waheshimiwa Wabunge hawa wataiunga mkono Hoja hii kikamilifu ili tuweze kurudishwa hapa mwaka wa 1993.Kwa haya machache, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, naomba kutoa Hoja na kupendekeza kwamba fnhe. Kiliku aiafiki. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKU: Asante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda. Nimesimama kuiafiki Hoja hii kwa sababu inaonyesha kwamba ulaguzi hauko katika dawa za kulevya peke yake, bali uko pia katika mambo ya ardhi. Watu wamekuwa wafisadi kiasi kwamba hawatarnbui mahali patakatifu palipotengewa Mungu, kama vile mahali pa kujenga msikiti, kanisa au kaya, bali hutambua pesa peke yake. nchi ikiwa namna hii huwa hatarini. Kile kizuri ni kuiombea nchi hii na maofisa wanaohusika ili watu wote waweze kumtambua Mungu hata kama wao ni Waislamu au Wakristu. Tuwaombee maofisa wa Serikali waokoke,kwa sababu wasipookoka, bila shaka, nchi hii itaangamia kiuchumi. Maofisa fulani wa Serikali huunga mkono mambo ambayo wanajua ni makosa.Kaya zimekuwapo tangu mwanadamu alipoumbwa. Wakati ardhi ilipokuwa ikitolewa kule Changamwe, katika Mikindani na Chaani, wale waliohusika hawakutenga mahali pa kujenga kanisa au mskiti. Lakini walitenga makaburi. watu waliokufa walizikwa humo, lakini makaburi haya yamejengwa nyumba juu yake. Hakuna makaburi tena kule Changamwe. Mwislamu akifa leo huko, twampeleka kule Kikoani, Mombasa, na ikiwa ni Mkristu, hupelekv:a kule Manyimbo. Hakuna makaburi kule Changamwe kwa sababu sehemu hizo zilitolewa na nyumba zikajengwa juu yake. Wafu walio chini ya nyumba hizi wanauliza, "Ni kwa nini mlitufanvia hivi? Kwa nini nyumba zimejengwa juu yetu?" Huku si kupendana Kabla ya Waziri anayehusika kutoa hati ya kumilki ardhi yo yote, ingefaa achunguz.c kilic'numo chini ya ardhi hiyo.MR. KILIKU (CTD.)Ukienda kule Chaani Primary School, utaona kwamba nyumba zimejengwa mpaka karibu na madarasa na huku akina mama wakikaanga kitunguu nyumbani mwao, watoto wa shule huwa wakihisi harufu ya kitunguu hivyo. Wale waliotoa ardhi hii hawakujali kama palikuwa na shule ya msingi hapo. Sasa hivi, hatuwezi kuipanua shule hiyo kwa sababu nyumba zimejengwa kote kuizunguka. Nimemchunguza Waziri anayehusika nikamwona akiandika maoni yetu. Tumechaguliwa kuja hapa kuwatetea wananchi, lakini utaona kwamba sasa hivi hatuna Waziri ye yote hapa. Ikiwa yuko, ainue mkono nimwone. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>AN HON. MEMBER: Hapa kuna MawaziriJ Huwezi kuwaona? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. EHIEU: BW.

You are not taking the Business of the House seriously! These are not responsible peoplei Hii ni shida kubwa tuliyonayo katika nchi hii Utaona kwamba viongozi ambao wanapaswa kuonyesha mfano mwema kwa wengine hawafiki katika Bunge hili. Ni lazima kuwe na nidhamu katika nchi hii. </NEWSPEECH>(The Temporary Deputy Speaker(Mr. Wa&uge) left the Chair)(The Temporary Deputy Speaker(Dr, Wameyo) took the Chair)<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES (Mr. Muregi): Jambo la nidhamu, Bw.

Hiyo nndiyo sababu Mtukufu Rais aliwateua Mawaziri Wasaidizi ili waweze kuwasaidia Mawaziri. Je, mhe.

Ukweli wa mambo ni kvvamba Mawaziri wamewakilishwa vyema hapa Bunge na Mawaziri VV'asaidisi. Unaweza kuendelea, mhe. Kilikui </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KILIKU: Bw. Naibu Spika wa 2m Muda, nikiendelea, ninge penda kusema kt7amba ni lazima tuipitishe: Hoja hii. Kwa hivyo yafaa Waziri anayehusika achukue hatua ya kutenga sehemu maalum kwa maombi na kuabudu katika sehemu mbali mbali hapa nchini na wala si katika sehemu ya Pwani peke yake. Hili ni jambo ambalo litawafanya watu kufahamu kwamba Bunge hili linafanya kazi na .kwamba lina uwezo. Kila kabila katika nchi hii ina njia zake za kuabudu. Kwa hivyo yafaa Waziri achukue hatua na kutenga sehemu maalum kwa maombi na kuabudu na .vile vile k.va ujenzi wa makanisa na misikiti. Hata Ks Wahindi wakitaka kujenga liindu temple yafaa waruhusiwe kuf anya hivyo. Vitu kama hivi havihitaji EH mapande makrabwa. sana ya ardhi. Tunaweza kucheza lakini ni hatari kumchezea Mwenyezi Mungu kv7a sababu anaweza kuangamiza watu. Mungu si wa kuchezewa. Mimi ninajua kwamba watu wa Kwale wamekasj.rika rjtuMp Mr,a sababu arclhi yao imechukuli'wa. Watu wa Kwale wanauliza hivi "Watu hawa wamezichukua sehemu za ufuo wa bahari na vile vile wamechukua sehemu zetu za maombi, Je. si kesho watatufuata na kuchukua nyumba zetu"? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>AN HON. MEMBER: Hata mabibi! </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.KILIKU: Mwingine anasema hata mabibii Mimi sikuyasema hayo, Kuna watu ambao wanayatumia medaraka yao kwa njia mbaya. Hilo si jambo zuri. Mambo kama haya yakifanyika watu wengine wanadai kwamba ni Serikali ambayo inayafanya Mambo haya hayafanywi na Serikali; yanafanywana walanguzi wachache; walafi wenye tamaa kubwa. Wao wanapenda kunyakua ardhi kote nchini. Hawa ni watu ambao hawatosheki. Ni lazima watu wote, wa.ki we mo Wabunge, Mawaziri YZasaidizi na Mawaziri, wafanyiwe; uchunguzi. Kama Mbunge ana ploti katika Kila wilaya ni lazima aeleze ni Mradi gani ambayo ameanzisha. Ninesema hivi kwa sababu ikiwa Waziri hatakuwa na uwezo juu ya maofisa wake hilo litakuwa jambo baya sana.Kwa hayo machache, naomba kuafiki. </NEWSPEECH>(Question proposed)<NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: Ahsante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, kwa kunipa nafasi hii ili nami niungane na wenzangu ambao wanawatakia mema wananchi. Ninamshukuru mhe. Boy kwa kuileta Hoja hii katika Bunge. Hii ni kwa sababu hii ni Hoja yenye maana sana kwa watu wetu. Nadhani kuna watu ambao hawajui map,na ya neno "KAYA‚Äù, Ninge Penda kuieleza maana. ya neno hili mtu ye yote asije akadhania kwamba Hoja hii imeletwa kukiwa na madhumuni yasiyoeleweka. Maana ya Kaya katika lugha yaMijikenda ni "nyumbani ". Kaya ni mahali ambapo ni patakatifu. Hapo zamani za kale hata kabla ya nchi hii kuj inyakulia Uhuru wake na kabla hata Wazungu kufika barani Afrika, watu waMijikenda valikuwa wazitumia hizi "Kaya kama sehemu za kufanyia ibada kwa Mwenyezi Mungu. Kwa mfanoiliweza kukumbwakuna wakati mwingine .ambapo nchii iliweza kukumbwa: na hali mbaya ya ukame.MR. BIDU (CTD.)Utaona Kwamba wakati kama huo watu wa Mijikenda walikuwa wakienda kule misituni kweyne kaya zao ili kumtolea Mungu dhabinhu.Piakuna masharti ambayo ni lazima yatimizwe kabla ya mtu Kuingia Kwenye Kaya.MR. BOY (CTD.)Kaya kili tunajiczitaja ni pahali patakativu ambapo huwezi kuingia unapovaa viatu, au suti. Ni pabali ambapo unapoingia, ni lazima uvae nguo maaium kwa sababu unakwenda huso ndar.i u kumwosba Mwenyezi Kungu. Kwa mara nyingi, tunapoomba nanna hivyo katika kaya hizi zetu, tunapata mambo tunayotakaoVile vile, ningetaka kusema kwanta, Katika yetu ya Kenya, inasema kwazba tuna uhuru wa kuabudu kama vile tuna uhuru wa kuzungumza. Hii ndiyo sababu mhe. Mtungemwensangu, emeona ni heri krwrr kuileta Hoja hii hapa Sungeni leo ili tuipitishe, ili hata Serikali kxiweze Iruyatambua kaya hizi na ksznax kiyaandika majina ya wenyewe. Ninasema hivyo kwa sababu sisi katika sehemu ya Pwani, tuna makabila tisa, ambayo tunayaita miji ker.da, na kuna pahali patakatifu ambapo hawa watu war.akwer.da kuabudu. Hii ndiyo sababu tunasema ni wajibu wa Serikali kuhakikisha kwamba sehemu hizi zina hifadhiwa na kuitwa majina ya watu waliozisnsisha.VileVile, Hoja hii ni ya z maana kubwa kwa sababu itaisaidia Serikali katika juhudi zake za kuhifadhi miti. Nasema hivyo kwa sababu ni desturi na mila za Kaya hizi kuhifadhi niti na wale wanaokwenda kuomba katika Kaya hizi, hawataki miti iwe ikikatakatwa ovyo ovyo na jambo hili linaambatana na Sheria ya Serikali. Ni: wajitu wa idara ya mizitu kuhifadhi miti na hivyo ni kusema kwamba Kaya hizi zinaisaidia sana idara hii. wanaokaa karibu na Kaya hizi, hawaruhusi'. miti kukatwa ovyo ovyo na kwa hivyo, ingefaa kama majina yao yangeandikwa katika kaya hizo. Jambo hili litatuwezesha kuuhifadhi undongo wetu kwa sababumiti huzuia mmoncnyoko wa ardhio Kama tunavyofahamu, r.isitu r.i mali ye asili na kwa vile hizi kaya zinazingatia sara mali ya asili, tungeziruhusu zihifadhiwe. Katika kaya hizi, kuna KZ wazee maalumu ambao hukae kule n.dani na kwa hivyo.in.gefaa kama majina yao yangeandikwa kule pia kwa sababu wanafahya kazi muhimu ya kuhifadhi miti.Kwa hivyo, Bw. Kaibu Spika wa Muda, tungetaka Hoja hii ipitishwe Bila mabadiliko yoyote na kwa vile maziri anayehusika na Hoja hii ni refiki yangu, atahakikisha kwamba Hoja hii imepitishwa bila kubadilishwa.

MAHAU: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I want to get clarification from the Assistant Minister. As far as I know, the term "Kaya" for places of worship is only confined to the X ‚ÄúMijikenda‚Äù area. So, when the Assistant Minister says that the term covers the whole country, where else is he referring to? </NEWSPEECH>	<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS AND SETTLEMENT (Mr. Mutiso): Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, nimesnangazwa na jambo la nidhamu lililotolewa na mhe. Johnstone Makau. Nimesema kuwa kil a kabila nchini Kenya lina mfano wake wa kuabudu Mungu kimila. Sehemu kama hizo za maombi ndizo zinazojulikana kama Kaya. Huenda mhe. Makau hakumbuki lakini hata sisi katika lugha ya Kikamba tuna ile tunayoita "Ithembo". Hii ni sehemu ambapo wazee wetu hapo zamani walikuwa wakikutana na kuabudu kimila. Kwa hivyo, kwa kuwa tuna jambo hili katika kila kabila, ndipo tumeonelea kuwa ni muhimu kuhifadhi sehemu kama hizo kwa wale wanaotaka kuendelea kuabudu kimila, na pia kwa nia ya kuhifadhi mambo hayo ya kale kihistoria chini ya Kenya National Museum. Kwa njia hii, wanafunzi wetu watakapokuwa wakifanya utafiti, watakuwa wakionyeshwa sehemu ambapo watu wa kale walikuwa wakiabudu, na hata wataweza kuviona vifaa vya zamani vilivyokuwa vikitumiwa na hao watu wa kale.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, kwa sababu hiyo, hili ni jambo ambalo Serikali imeonelea ni muhimu kuhifadhi, hasa kwa wale ambao bado wanayazingatia mambo ya kimila. Watu kama hao wanafaa kuruhusiwa kuendelea na kuwa na mahali pao pa kuabudu, lakini sehemu hizo ziandikishwe chini ya Kenya National Museum kama sehemu zilizotengwa kwa minajili ya kuhifadhi sehemu za kihistoria. Nina hakika Wabunge wengi wanakubaliana na jambo hili na kila mmoja wetu ameridhika kuwa hili ni jambo muhimu. Hakuna pingamizi yoyote iliyoko kati ya Wizara na mhe. Boy na, kwa hivyo, naamini itakuwa ni hivyo kwamba sehemu hizi zote ziwe zikiandikishwa chini ya kifungu cha sheria cha Kenya National Museums.Kwa hayo machache, naomba kutoa pendekezo hilo. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH> THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES (Mr. Muregi): . Ahsante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, kwa kunipatia nafasi hii niweze kuafiki Hoja hii, kama ilivyopendekezwa na mhe. Mutiso. Hii ni Hoja ya muhimu sana na ningependa kuwapongeza watu wa Pwani kwa kujitolewa kuhifadhi sehemu zenye misitu kama iliyotajwa kwa minajili ya kuabudu kitamaduni. Ni kweli kwamba watu wa taifa lolote wasio na dini ama kuheshimu utamaduni ni watumwa. Kwa hivyo, watu wa Pwani wanastahili pongezi nyingi kwa kuhifadhi sehemu hiyo ya Kaya Waa.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, wakati huo huo, uhifacihi wa sehemu kama hizo ni mfano mwema kwa sababu sote tunajua kuwa ni muhimu sana kuihifadhi misitu kwa vyovyote. Hivi majuzi tumejua sababu fulani za hewa kuharibika sana kutokana na mivuke mbali mbali na wanadamu kuwa katika hali ya hatari. Njia ambayo tungeweza kuitumia kuhifadhi mazingira yetu ni kupanda miti zaidi na kuihifadhi misitu kwa njia zote tuwezazo. Wizara yangu, kwa sababu hiyo, inawafurahia wananchi wa Pwani sana kwa vile wameweza kuihifadhi miti ambayo ingekuwa imepotea duniani. Hii ni miti ya kipekee inayopatikana katika kaya hizi tu. Ni jambo la muhimu basi kuona kwamba kaya hizi zimehifadhiwa na kutunzwa vizuri kama jinsi i1ivyopendekezwa na Waziri Msaidizi, kwamba ziwe zikiangaliwa kwa njia maalum na Kenya National Museums. Ninaafiki pendekezo hi 1o lililotolewa na mhe. Mutiso kwa nguvu sana.Pia, ningependa kusema kuwa baada ya kuandikishwa chini ya Kenya National Museums, kuwe na ulinzi wa askari. Nasema hivi kwa sababu hivi majuzi nilitembelea kaya hizi upande wa Kambi, karibu Kilifi na niliona kuwa wakulima wenyewe, ambao wanapaswa kuziheshimu kaya hizi, wameendelea kulima katika kaya hizo. Wanajaribu kuyaongeza mashamba yao kwa kuingia kwenye kaya hizo na kulima, na hata kuing'oa miti bila kujali umuhimu wa miti hiyo. Kwa sababu nchi yote nzima, ikiongozwa na Mtukufu Rais, imeji tolea kupanda miti mingi zaidi, na hasa miti ya kienyeji, basi inatupasa kuihifadhi miti iliyo katika kaya hizi kwa vyovyote.Natoa shukrani kwa mhe. Boy aliyeiwasilisha Hoja hii, na pia naitolea Wizara pongezi kwa jinsi Hoja hii i1ivyorekebishwa, na kwa hayo machache, naomba kuafiki.(Question of the first part of the amendment, that the words to to be deleted be deleted, proposed)(Question of the second part of the amendent, that the words to be inserted in place thereof be inserted, proposed) </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Karauri): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the amendment and, in so doing, I wishTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Karauri)(CTD.)to say that hon. Juma Boy had very good intentions by seeking that the places of worship that used to be there during the days of our forefathers, and are still being used for worship even today, should not be destroyed but should be preserved for posterity and so that they will always be a reminder to the future generation of what the past generation was doing.At the same time, I would not like to agree with the original idea that a place of worship should have about eight acres set aside. Even when people want to erect churches in this country, they are normally granted a maximum of five acres. If they want to build a school, then a separate allocation is made. If there are other activities required, then the land is separately applied for specifically and, normally, such requests are honoured.THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Karauri) (CTD.)All over the country areas that have been set aside for public use should be preserved.Mr.Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Lands and Housing two Acts when demarkating land. One of the Acts requires that you gather all your land in pieces, if you measured an acre a kilometre away and another 500 metres away, all this land is put together as your land. There is another Act, where they just measure the area where you live and that is where you get your title deed with your other pieceof. land far away demarcated as separate land.I am saying this Mr. Speaker, Sir, because there are areastoday where the Ministry itself is causing some confusion, a place may have been set aside for public use, maybe to build a school and some people may have encroached on that piece of land. Now, where the Act talks about demarcating your piece ofland where it is and some people happened to have stayed inthe school compound or a church compound, It is becoming difficult to move this people. So, I would like the Ministry of Lands and Housing to ensure that the public land that was set aside for public use must be given priority over individual interests. I am saying this because it is happening and we would like, it to be corrected.	In my own constituency, we have Nehuri neheka elders we have set aside ( land for thern and we would not like to hear that any one time, an individual wants to use that land and therefore is allocated that land.THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Karauri) (CTD.)I am aware of the complaints from hon Members from the Coast Province. For example, when hon. Boy, was moving this Motion, he laboured on issued affecting people wanting beach plots and so on. The beach plots are big assets to this country and that is where we develop our big hotels for tourist attractions and this country gains a lot from foreigners or tourists coming to stay in those hotels; to enjoy the sunny coasts at Mombasa. What I would like to appeal is that when these plots are allocated for development, the leaders who are allocated these plots should refrain from selling them to foreigners. They should develop them. If they cannot develop the, after they jave been honoured with the allocation, I think, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they should.<HEADER>QUORUM<HEADER><NEWSPEECH>DR.WAMEYO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

Ring the Division Bell. </NEWSPEECH>(The Division Bell was rung)<NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwima): We now have a quorum, You may go on, Kr. Karuri. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Karauri): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to continue from where I left. Before I do that, however, I think somebody should restrain hon. Wameyo from raising points of order relating to quorum on Wednesday morning. He himself is not here every time.I was saying that those who were given plots in the beach should use them appropriately and refrain from selling them to foreigners. If they do not have the capability to develop these plots, let them sell them to indigenous Africans. Our banks should also be generous. If somebody manages to be given a beach plot, the banks should be able to finance him so that he can develop the plot. I say so because beach plots, especially in the Coast, these plots are going to be of tremendous economic advantage to this country but, if they are thrown away to foreigners, the money that would otherwise be due to us will no longer come to us.With these very few remarks, I beg to support. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MAKAU: Thank you, MR. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Ninasimama kuunga mkono Hoja hii iliyowasilishwa hapa na mhe. Boy. Kama ilivyopendekezwa na mhe. Mutiso, Hoja hii ni muhimu sana kwa sababu inatarajia kufanya vitu viwili vya maana sana. Kwanza, utamaauni wetu utalindwa na Hoja hii. Nilipotoa jambo la nidhamu, Waziri Msaiaizi altuhakikisha kwamba Hoja hii italinda mahali kote ambako wananchi warn;tenga kuwe mahali pa ibanda. K.ile ambacho kila mrooja wetu anastahili kujua ni kwamba kaya ni kule mahali ambako tfakamba walikuwa wakikuita ithembo. Huku ni mahali ambako kulikuwa na miti mikubwa sana na ambako watu fulani walikuwa wakienda kuabudu. Hapa si mahali pa kila mtu kwenda. Hata kaya na mahali kwingine kur.akotumiwa na Nchuri Nchehs simahali pa Kila mtu kwenda. Wazee wachache tu ndio huenda kuabudu huko. Mahali kw.ingine kama huku si mahali pa ibada, bali watu hukaa huko na kuzungumza mambo ya kabila lao.Ninaunga Hoja hii mkono kwa sababu inahusu nchi nzima. Imesemekanc kwamba National Museums of Kenya ndizo zitakazokuwa zikiangalia kaya na mathemboMR. MAKAU (CTD.)ambayo ni mahali patakatifu. Wakati wa ukame, watu walikuwa wakienda huko kuomba ili mvua inyeshe. Hili ni jambo la maana sana linaiocnyesha kwamba tunauzingatia utamaduni wetu. Hoja hii imewasilisnwa hapa kwa sababu ya watu wachache ambao hawatosheki waliokuwa wameanza kutoa hati za kumilki ardhi. Labda mhe. Mbunge mwenyewe alikuwa amepewa hati moja kati ya hizi, lakini nimesikia kwamba wale waliokuwa wamepewa hati hizi wamezirudisha. Ningependa kumshuku kwa sababu ameirudisha hati aliyokuwa amepewa. Hata ingawa alikuwa ameichukua hati hiyo, kuirudisha kwake kunaonyesha kwamba hakutaka kaya zilizokuwa zimetengwa zitumiwe kwa njia nyingine isiyokusudiwa. Kule katika Kwale, mambo yalikuwa moto sana. Mhe. Mbunge.amesema kwamba watu wengine wakubwa walikuwa wamenyakua ardhi hii, lakini wananchi waliojua habari ya kaya wakalalamika na watu hao wakairudisha ardhi hiyo. Hoja hii inastahili kupitishwa ili iwe onyo kwa wale ambao wamezoea kunyakua ardhi ambayo imetengwa kwa minajili ya ibada.Tulisoma katika gazeti kwamba kuna mtu fulani kule Mombasa ambaye alikuwa ameriyakua mahali pa lcuzika wafu. Hoja hii inafaa kuwa onyo kwa wale ambao wanataka kunyakua kila ardhi inayopatikana. W√∂kati alipokuwa kiitoa Hoja hii, mhe. Mbunge alisema kwamba alikuwa mepewa hati ya kumilki ardhi na kwamba idadi ya watu wote waliokuwa wamepewa hati hizi ni 87. √Øungetaka ayalete majina ya watu hawa wote ili tujue kama wote wamezirudisha hati hizo. Pengine, wengine wao wameziweka katika benki kama security. Huenda tunazungumza juu ya Hoja hii wakati ambapo watu hawa hawajazirudisha hati zao. Tukiipitisha Hoja hii huku tukifikiri kwamba tunazilinda kaya, huenda hatutafaulu kwa sababu hata ingsva mhe. Mbunge anasema kwamba aliirudisha hati yake, huenda watu wengine hawajurisha zile zao. Ninasikia kwamba Waziri fulani pia alikuwa amepewa hati kama hii na tungcpenda kujua kama aliirudisha.Jambo la pili ambalo lilitajwa na waheshimiwa Wabunge wengine ni kwamba kuna misitu ambayo ilikuwa imetengwa kama kaya kwa watu wa Miji Kenda, matnembo kwa watu wa Ukambani, Nchuri Ncheke kwa watu wa Meru na kwingineko kwa minajili ya ibada.Bw, Naibu Spika wa Mude, misitu ni muhima sana katika nazingara yetu Kwa vile Hoja .tunayojadili hapa inahusiana sana na mazingara ningeiomba Wizara ya Mazingara na Kaliasili itafute rrhrrrrr chanzo cha ule ugonjwa ambao unaianganiza miti aina ya cypress hapa nchini. Waziri wa Mazingara na Mali as ili hivi majuzi alisema kwamba huenda nchi hii ikapote za kiasi cha Shs.200 bilioni. Ingefaa w waziri alifafanue zaidi jambo hili k.va sababu watu wa sehemu kama LfDooni ambako kuna miti mingi aina ys. Cypress wsnaweza Irapata hasara kubwa sana. Kuna watu c.bac v.anazurura huku na huko wakiwaomda watu wawape pesa ili waweze Irrrirzyz kuinyunyizia dawa miti yao ambayo imeambukizwa ule ugonjwa wa Syrfrjrr Cypress Aphid. Je, watu hawa wamepata idhini yo yote kutoka E kwa wizara inayohusika? Kuna njia nyingine inayo julikana kama "biological method" ambayo ilitumiwa kule Australia kuwaangamiza wadudu wanasababisha ugonjwa huu wa miti. Kuna wadudu wengine ambao wanaweza kuwala wadudu wanasababisha ugonjwa huu wa miti na hao ndio waliotumiwa kule Australia kunaliza ugonjwa huu. Xwa hivyo ni lazima Wizara ifikirie kutumia njia hiyo badala ya ya kutumia dawa prn Day o xnawe za kugharima pesa nyingi sana.Jambo lingine ni kuhusu ugawaji wa ploti. Ugawaji wa ploti sasa uko mikononi mwawizara ya Seri kali za wilaya. Ugawaji wa ploti ulikuwa umetolewa katika wizara hiyo hapo awali kwa sababu kulikuwa na watu ambao waiitoa ploti kwa kutumia njia za udanyarjyifu. Kwa hivyo ni lazima utoaji wa ploti ufanywe kwa njia ya haki na majina ya wele waliopewa ploti yawe yakichapi shwa ili watu wote waweze kujua. Hapo awali ploti zilikuwa zina tolewa lava watu ambao hawana uwezo wa kuziendeleza. Hakuna haja ya kunpatia ploti ambazo ataziuza fcaxss badala ya kujenga.?Zw Kaibu Spika wa muda; ugawaji wa plot! ni jambo ambalo linahitaji kaangaliwa kwa makini sana Hii ni kwa sababu ni lazina Irutengwe viwanja ambayo vitatumiwa kwa ujenzi wa shule. Pia ni lazima kutengwe sehemu za makaburi katika miji yetu kwa sababu kuna watu. wengi ambao wanaishi nijini. √ºkienda katika mji kama Llachakos utakata kwamba viwanja vyote vimetolewa kwa watu. Hata katika vit no vya biashsra kale mashambani viwanja vyote vimegawiwa watu. Wale ambao wamezoea iiunyakua viwanja ni iazima wakomeshwe. Kinamshukuru mhe. Boy kwa kukataa kupokea hati ya kumiliki ardhi katika misitu ya Kaya. Kama angekubali yeye angeweza kuliona Bunge hili tena.Kwa hayo mass machache, naomba kuunga mkono. </NEWSPEECH>(Question 01 the second part of the amendment, that the words to be inserted in place thereof be inserted, proposed)(Question of the second part of the amendment, that the words to be inserted in place thereof be inserted, put and agreed to)(Question of the Motion as amended proposed)<HEADER>QUORUM</HEADER><NEWSPEECH>DR.

Kwa sababu mabadiliko haya si ya kuiua Eoja bali ni ya kujenga, naw&shukuru ili wakifika ofisini mwao, ijulikane kwamba walifanya mabadiliko. za Kaya viaaJambo ambalo ningependa kusema ni kwamba zile hati/ambazo zilitolewa karibu 60 zilitupiliwa mbali zote. Eabari hii pia ilichapishwa katika gaseti maalum la Serikali. rTaishukuru IJizar.a kwa kutupilia mbali hati hizi na kwa kaziregesha katika ofisi ya ardhi huko Kwale. Kitu cha niuhimu ni kscc kwamba kaya hizi ni takatifu na aja.hu ni kwamba Viaziri Msaidi si arnependekesa kwamba ziwe chini ya Kenya National Museums. Kaya. vfaa inachukuwa karibu hekari 39 ya ardhi na tunasizitiza kwamba ardhi hii isipunguzwe hata hekari moja Tunataka ardhi hii ibaki vile ilivyo hata kaya hizi zitakuwa chini ya Kenya National Museums na sio waje waseme "Ohi we are planning to put up another museum in one of our lands." Hapana. Ingefaa wao wawe trustees wa ardhi hii r.a sio wawe we rye kutoa smri. Hii r.i kwa sababu wakubwa wa gredi wonaper.da beach plots sana. Hata nashangaa vile wanavyokula. mchana.

Ingefaa ieleweke kwamba kazi ya KenyaNational kuseums italcuva ksimamia ardhi hii kama trustees tu. Si vakae katiiza ofisi irubva kubwa na kusema "oh yes. We have 37 pieces of land near the he ach. Vie can do some development.'1 √Ø√Øasidanganyve na digrii sao na ku" kata shauri juu ya hekari 80 sa watu. Hatutaki hivyo. Zo.ia. Hii kha it aki maner.o mengi bali inataka mali ya vananchi yalindwe.Ingefaa wizara hii ijue i.dadi ya kaya hizi ili zitengewe na visuri na mipaka ijulikane wazi wazi. Kwa mfano. Kongo lloscue kule diani ilikuva na ardhi ya zaidi ya hekari 10 lakini baada ya muda fulani ardhi hii ikapu sita nguzva hadi hekari nane na baadaye ikapunguzva hadi hekari j na hatimaye hekari nne. Mvishove, i 1 ipunguzva zaidi na sasa ni moscue tu inasimama hapo: hakuna ardhi ya ziada. 27asema hivi ili waziri xsaidizi va zhz. Wizara hii aeleve visuri kwa sababu najua anafahamu yale ninayosema. Wale vananchi ambao valiitenga ardhi hii ya hekari 87 havakuva mabuzuranga. Kama wizara hii inataka kuvapatia vatu vengine ardhi hii, mbona hawavajulishi hava vananchi ambao valiitenga?

Temporary Deput Speaker, Sir, 1 begTHAT, in view of the reknown fact that the former well equipped government "A" Level Schools had excelled in public examinations and vara conducive for the enhancement of national unity now then, in order to ensure persuation of the foregoing and also engages as many Kenyans as possible to utilize facilities in these schools; this house verges the Government to convert s.11 former Government "A" Level Schools into national schools, and further that at least one such school be located in each district.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this riot a on seeks foremost to have Kenya's national unity enhanced. One of the ways of doing this is through having the youth grow, learn, enjoy and, if they have problems, suffer together, we know of the Ministry of Education1s move of having k 85 per cent of Standard Light qualifiers going secondary schools in their own districts. How that we no longer have "A" Level classes, we will have fellows going up to the university level without having ever stayed outside his home district and I do not think this can enhance national In unity.The former "A" Level schools used to admit students who had passed .veil from ali over the country to study anywhere in the country. So, these fellows were later employed and posted to, say, Western or Coast Province there was a bi~ oossibilitv of sonebodv w	is	1/havingbeen there and learned a bit of their traditions nana so on. ~f somebody had been taken to the Coast, perhaps, he would not have to learn about "kaya" from this House Ire would have known something about it from the Coast people.V'e Imow too well that when we visit foreign countries we meet people who have been in this country and who seem to knowR.bcwi I": than our selves. If we continue to have only 15 it admitting students from: rill over the country "hoi kin; c: 7 situation will worsen. Pot last year we had 272 '"A" level Schools out of a total of 2, 554 secondary schools. Iowa, Level seven oboes fern about 10 per cent of the two, seven secondary schools that we have now. Vie are thus saying that this 10 per cent, rather than the 15 national schools, be allowed to admit the best students from all over the country.This in motion is not aching for anything new because the former A: level Schools used to admit students for. all over the country, this gives our youth from different communities to come together and get to appreciate other peoples culture. </NEWSPEECH><HEADER>COURT: </HEADER><NEWSPEECH>LIES liDETEI: On a point of order, ire. Temporary Deputy Speaker. Sir. In view of the fact that many ions. Limbers have been attaching a lot of importance to this particular lotion, I third: they do not know that the JJS hot ion is being moved. While I do not want to disrupt the business in the House, I would like the Division to be rung because we do not seem to have quorum in the House </NEWSPEECH>.<NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Dr. Wameyo): Ices Nettie, is you point of order that there is no quorum? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MRS.NDETEI: Yes, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker; there is no quorum and yet this lotion is very important.THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Dr. Wameyo). You are right: ring the Division Bell. </NEWSPEECH>(The Division Bell was rung) <NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Dr. Wasco): There is a quorum now. You can precede hon. Kaonde. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KYONDA: Thank you very much. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir I thank the gracious lady, hon. (Mrs.) Ndetei for raising the quorum issue so that many more hon. Members can come and debate this important Motion.I was saying that as a country we cannot afford to be parochial. This Motion is urging the Government to make these 272, not more or less, 'A' Level schools to become national schools so that students from all over the Republic can have access to schools in all the districts of the Republic. When these students from all parts of the country are being admitted to national schools in other parts of the country, they will be learning more about their country. As I said before, we have had visitors in the country who know our country more than we do. When we travel we appreciate how other people live and why they have some particular beliefs, tendencies and traditions. A young man who has exposure of the various cultures and beliefs of different tribes in Kenya would not have any trouble when, at a later date, he has to be posted to other areas to work.When you look at the population of 16 national schools and compare them with the population of some 2,700 schools, the difference is apparent. That is why this Motion is seeking to have the Government look at this very important aspect of the youth getting to know their country. We hear of complaints made in the House by hon. Members about bad road conditions in various parts of the country and, therefore, when we allow future leaders to travel to other places other than their home areas, they get to know that there are other places that could be having similar problems like they have back home. We hear of some hon. Meirbers also complaining of the lack of tarmacked roads in their constituencies but, when these young people are made to travel to all these other areas, they will come to understand the plight of those in other parts of the country. In future they would have had the foreknowledge on the conditions in those sectors of the country.MR. KYONDA (CTD.)I know that by having these national schools and; hence having jour youth being admitted into the schools countrywide, some people may complain that they will have to be paying a lot in terms of bus fares but, eventually, what they gain from such exposure will be more worthy.It is a known fact that these national schools excel in the national examinations. The other day I asked to be given a breakdown of the top 200 schools in last year's examinations. A very elaborate list was given to me by the Ministry in which some 32 districts which were shown to have at least one national school, while others had more than one such school. We know that we have 42 districts in the country, with the recent addition of NyaMra. This means that there were, at least, 10 districts without a national school out of the 200 top national schools.When we look at the 272 'A' level schools, we find that there were 175 schools which were in the top 200. The rest comes from these other schools which comprise about 2,300 secondary schools. This goes to confirm that many of these 'A' level schools have their traditions; they have the facilities and even teachers. In most cases, you also find that such teachers do not want to move elsewhere. We are talking of sharing the national cake. You find that 14 districts in the country had only the 'A' level type of schools among the top 200 in the country and not national schools. There were eight other districts which had more than 75 per cent of their schools in the top 200 as 'A' level schools. What this means, as I said before, is that those schools were well equipped by the Government; they had a lot of facilities, as opposed to other schools and, consequently, they had sufficient teachers and the performance of the schools was good.I do not want to be naive to say that all of them performed well, because they could not do so. However, I want to emphasize on that point of the 14 districts in the country which had no national schools, but have only 'A' level schools, while others have more than 75 per cent of national schoolsMR. KYONDA (CTD.)Looking at the list from the Ministry, I note that there were only four districts which had a secondary school in the top 200 as 'A' level. However, these 14 districts had 54 .secondary schools. These eight districts with more than 75 per cent had 37 secondary schools. We are saying that the former 'A' level schools are far better than other schools. It is only fair that they be put to national use.In Machakos District, we had 74 students who qulified to be admitted to university, out of 138 students. Mumbuni, which is an ‚ÄúA1‚Äù  level school had 55 students. There are schools which students excelled in national examinations and it is only fair that such schools be put to national use." As a country it is important that we share the national cake as best as it can be done. We have our universities and we do not hear the mention that the university belongs to this community, or that. Even in agricultural terms, we always share the produce we have in the country so that even those who do not grow much have something from those other areas where plenty is grown.If we can have 10 districts without any of their schools in the top 200, it means that there are areas that are not developed enough, that is not having the right facilities in school to enable them to perform well and have students being admitted into our universities. We are always saying that we want as many of our students who qualify to enter universities and, surely, that can be achieved if we are prepared to share the national cake equally.With those few remarks, I beg to move and request that hon. Mcharo seconds this Motion. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MCHARO: Thank: you very much. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. When we talk of national schools, we are trying to emphasise one or two very important goals of education. As the hon. Mover has already said, one of the most important aims of our educational system is to enhance national unity in this country. This is precisely what national schools are expected to do in this country.The other point is that national schools are intended to offer quality education to the children of this country. Therefore, we must support the idea of establishing a few more national schools that those that we have today. The top students in the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education are always offered places in national schools, and this where academic excellence at secondary school level is to be found. The Ministry of Education in particular is paying a lot of attention to the improvement of national schools because our top students should be enabled to find an academic environment where their talents would be properly challenged by the presence 01 good teachers and excellent learning facilities. This is where we should find some of our best material to go to university and pursue courses leading to such vital areas as medicine, engineering law, and so on.The national secondary schools we have today are, in our view, not adequate. We need to identify as many schools as possible of the level of the former A Level schools we used to have. If we convert these schools to secondary schools, this will improve the performance of our secondary schools. Quite a number of our provincial schools are good enough to be converted to national schools so that more of our children can compete for places there.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. when some of our bright children do not find places in our national schools they become disheartened. So, the passage of this motion is one way of encouraging good children to find places in national schools. We should give them the hind of encouragement required for their academic performance.I quite agree with the hover that we need as many national schools as possible. If not all the former ‚ÄúA‚Äù Level schools can be converted to national schools, let us identify some of the best provincial schools and in every province and convert then into national schools. We have proposed in the past that at least and I am happy the hover has indicated this every district should have two national schools preferably one for boys and one for girls so that every district in this country can be r proud of having a national school where children can go and learn. 3y having a national school in every district we will have made a major contribution towards enhancement of national unity. National unity is very vital to this country today. Kenya as a nation must continue to he developed into one entity; into one cohesive society. As His Excellency the President has stated over and over again, we must endeavour to create a very cohesive society. This can best be done at school level; particularly at the secondary school level.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, facilities in our schools must continue to be improved at all costs. The Government and the Ministry of Education must assist the people. Through the Haramhee spirit we must continue to look for funds to assist us in providing the necessary facilities for our 3‚Äì4‚Äì4 educationgo to national schools must be given the right facilities to raise their academic standards.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, staffing of schools in this country has always been a problem, while talking about national schools we should not forget the other schools. This is because when we talk of national schools, as I said earlier, we are really endeavouring to improve the quality of our schools. We must do everything within our powers to improve the standards of all public schools in this country. Those who fail to find places in national, schools should not feel discouraged when they are offered places in other schools. The staffing of these schools should be excellent and this will make our children have confience in our schools.Our teacher training colleges must be improved so that we can train as many teachers as possible. This will enable us to finally phase out the untrained teacher element. Parents have contributed HTSE enormously towards the financing of education in this country. The non-teaching staff in our schools have complained quite a number ¬£ of times that they are not getting their salaries on time because the schools do not receive grants on time. I would here like to urge the Ministry to do everything possible to help these people. The nonteaching staff in our national schools, provincial schools and other public schools who are employed by the Boards of Governors ksk should be paid their salaries directly by the Ministry of Education. They should receive payslips every mouth from the Lianas try This is very important because when the grants are not received in time and when there are no fees the non-teaching staff do not get their salaries in time and they become very disc our aged. So the Ministryof Education should look into this matter very seriously.with those remarks, I beg to second the Motion. </NEWSPEECH>(Question proposed)<HEADER>ADJOURNMENT </HEADER>	<NEWSPEECH>(Mr. Wameyo): Koru Members, it is now time for the interruption of Business.

S.M. AMIN asked the Minister of State, Office of the President whether he could consider having Members of Parliament, in their respective constituencies, included in the interview panels dealing with the employment of chiefs.<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT, (Mr. Onyancha): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The present arrangement governing interview panels dealing with the employment of chiefs works very well and my Ministry, therefore, is not considering having Members of Parliament in their respective constituencies included in these panels. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. EKIDOR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, since Kenya is a democratic country and we have a political Government, can the Assistant Minister tell the House the secret that makes them to exclude Members of parliament from attending those pane </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is no secret. Chiefs and assistant chiefs are civil servants and their appointments are undertaken by the Ministry upon the author: delegated by the Public Service Commission.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the provisions of that Act do not provide anywhere, that hon. Members of Parliament or politicians should be included in the panels. Under the Act it is the provincial comissior.er, who is deligated the powers MR. ONYANCHA (CTD.) :to carry out the duties that should have been carried out by the Public Service Commission. That is the only reason. There is no secret anywhere. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, arising from the Assistant Ministers reply and in view of the fact that the chiefs and assistant chiefs are not transferrable does he agree with me that we need chiefs who can command the dignity of the area he represents? There used to be a system called "Mlolongo" before for selecting chiefs who command majority support of the area. Why was that system removed? As a.result today, we get cheifs or assistant chiefs who.arevery unfamiliar with the public </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is just because of the same reason that the selection was availed to eveybody that the system failed. At the end of the day those who were selected were found not to be fit at all to .do the job, because they were simply selected because of some kind of popularity or even through bribery andthat kind of thin. So, at the end of the day it was found that that system could not work well. This is because the functions being carried out by the chiefs as civil servants are very very important and that is why, the Act was amended and we reverted to the original system. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. EKIDOR: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is the. Assistant Minister in order to impute that civil servants are very important? Does it mean that other people are not important? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I was trying just to continue with the trend of thought of the hon. Member that the office of the chief is very important. The functions carried out by the chiefs and assistant chiefs are very important. I never said that other offices are not important, Sir. </NEWSPEECH>MR. JALDESSA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, considering that the post of chief is very important, is the Assistant Minister aware that it has tended to create a lot of controversy in appointments? We do not believe that the Assistant Minister is not influencing the appointment of chiefs in his own area. Can he just consider allowing politicians to a participate in the appointment of chiefs? <NEWSPEECH>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, systems are tried, and some work while others fail. The one being advocated now has failed. The current system may not be 100 per cent perfect but it is working very well under cur present circumstances. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. WAMEYO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I wish to bring to the attention of the hon. Assistant Minister that the present system of selecting chiefs and assistant chiefs has brought a lot of corruption in the country because there are only two people involved. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>HON. MEMBERS: Hear! Hear! </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. WAMEYO: In the past chiefs and assistant chiefs were normally selected by a pannel which included a sitting Member of Parliament, and before that they were selected by queueing. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, Dr. Waineyo. What is your question? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. WAMEYO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if chiefs and assistant chiefs are proper civil servants, why are they not transferable? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member know that chiefs and assistant chiefs are really civil servants; he should not have any doubts about it. Chiefs and assistant chiefs are not transferable due to the nature of their work. They cannot work well elsewhere than where they are appointed They are civil servants and hon. Members know that. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. S.M. AMIN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the fact remains that the Assistant Minister himself has a lot of problems in his constituency as far as chiefs and assistant chiefs are concerned. It was only the other day, I am told, that there was corruption to that effect. So, it would be very important that Members of Parliament should sit in the selection panneli in their respective constituencies. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, Mr. Amin. You are now making a statement. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. S.M. AMIN: All I am trying to say, Sir, is chat Members of Parliament should be considered for members of the selection pannel. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: That is not a question still. Mr. Onyancha, you do not wish to respond to it, </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. ONYANCHA: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I only want to ask the hon. Member to substantiate the very serious statement he has made that the other day there was a lot of corruption in Kisii District. First of all, I come from NyaMra District but, all the same, I would like to know what this corruption was about. That is a very serious allegation. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Amin, you have been asked to substantiate your claims. Are you willing to say anything about it? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. S.M. AKIN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, all I am saying is that there has also been lots of problems in Kisii District as far as the selection of chiefs and assistant chiefs is concerned. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Amin, that is what you have been asked to substantiate. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. S.M. AMIN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the fact remains that there is a problem to that. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. ONYANCHA: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, The hen. Member is not responding to my request. Can he either substantiate or withdraw that serious statement. I am not away of any corruption that took place the other day in Kisii District. Can he withdraw that one? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Well, we will have to get out Yes, Mr.Kyonda. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KYONDA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, arising from the Assistant Minister answer,, it is important to point out, as other hon. Members have said, that the present system of appointing chiefs and assistant chiefs that the Assistant Minister is saying has worked is the one that we know doe's not work and which has brought a lot of problems in many locations, including mine. Could the Office of the President consider including sitting Members of Parliament in the pannel or even reintroducing the mololongo system for appointing chiefs? What the Assistant Minister is saying is working is not working at all. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, up to now none of the1 hon. Members has come up to indicate how that system is not working. In fact, the system has been working very we'll up to now and none of the hon. Members is saying anything. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MAKHANU: Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>HON. MEMBERS: DC! DC! DC! Kisii DC! </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MAKHANU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, contrary to the expectation of hon. Members, I am not going to answer their... </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Kamuren): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I thought I thought I heard hon. Members calling hon. Makhanu D.C. from Kisii. Is that in order? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MAKHANU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, it is true that I was a district commissioner for Kisii for a long time and, therefore, that kind of humour is in order. However, in the light of the hon. Members concern about the appointment of chiefs and assistant chiefs and alleged corruption and all those things, will the Assistant Minister have any objection to my suggestion that we be allowed to amend the Chiefs Authority Act in order to contain some of these allegations? I think if we amend that Act some: of those things will be quite taken care of. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. Deputy. Speaker, Sir, as you must have noted, the hon. Member is very cautious because he himself, as a former district commissioner, knows and can confirm that the present system is the best for the time being. He is a district commissioner, never practised any corruption and the" system worked. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Kamuren, are you satisfied that Mr. Makhanau is a former district commissioner? Do you have any problem about that? </NEWSPEECH>(Laughter)<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Kamuren): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, since the hon. Member has confirmed by keeping quiet, I think he is also a district commissioner. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MAKHANU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Overrulled. We must get on. Dr. Wameyo, can you please ask your Question? </NEWSPEECH>Question No. 553Return of Mrs. Europe‚Äôs Post BookDR. WAMEYO asked the Vice-president and Minister for Finance when Mrs. Dina Raimondi Erupt of P.O. Box 92, Mummies, be given her Kenya Post Office Savings Bank Book No. 13240, submitted on 14th July, 1989, to the Bank, Ref. 5900/AM/L/1/89.<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICEPRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Kariuki): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.I am pleased to inform the hon. Member that the problem has been sorted out and all that the good lady has to do is to simply bring a photograph of herself  and she will get her pass book. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. WAMEYO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not understand the answer from the Assistant Minister because this book, submitted on 14th July, 1989, cannot be found. Why did they write a long time ago that the book is lost and that they would like the lady to submit photographs? Why should they wait until I put this Question? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KARIUKI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will give the reason why. The story of this pass book is that Mrs. Diana Raimondi Erupt opened her savings bank account with the Post Bank in 1979 and was issued with the necessary account pass book as required by the standing instructions of the bank. However, in July, 1989, Mrs. Dina Naimondo forwarded here account pass book to the Post Bank headquarters for verification and the book was dispatched back to her in August, 1989, through P.O. Box 92, Mumias. The bank discovered later that the pass book aid not reach the customer and she was immediately contacted and advised to officially report the pass book loss, which she did on 24th January, 1990. This discovery came after the bank had received, unfortunately, withdrawal documents on the same account, which we're suspected to be fraudulent. The matter was also immediately MR. KARIUKI (CTD.)reported to the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation's Investigation Department with a view to recovering the poas book and apprehending the person who was making fraudulent withdrawals with the pass book.Mr. Deputy Speaker, when the bank realised that this process was taking rather long, they decided to issue another pass book to the lady as she had requested. This new pass book was posted to her on 29th October, 1990, through the same Box Number.MR.KARIUKI (CTD.);Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this was a request that she sends her photograph so that she can be issued with a new passbook .So, a request has been written to her She has been requested to send her photograph so. That she is issued with a new passbook because the previous one cannot be found. Thank you. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. WAMEYO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I put it to the Assistant Minister that this is not the only passbook that has been from lost / Mumias area. More Questions are coming. What is happening with the Post Bank? 'why are books from Mumias getting lost? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KARIUIKI: Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am not aware of any other cases. I am only aware of the case of Mrs. Dina Naimondo. I have explained that the passbook was lost when it was despatched to her She has been requested to send her photograph so that the good Post Bank can send her another passbook. The Post Office Savings Bank has been so efficient that it has gone out of its way to write to her requesting her to send her photograph a mere photograph so that . she can be issued with another passbooks </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. GALGALLO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, while appreciating that reply from the Assistant Minister, could he tell the House what is going to happen. The Assistant Minister has said that some money has been withdrawn. That is going to happen to Mrs. Dina Naimondo Srupe when she gets her book back? Will the amount that has been withdrawn excluded? Has she been assured that she will get all her money? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KARIUKI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, like I said, investigations are still going on to find out who this fraudulent withdrawer from the Post Bank through her account is Immediately the investigations are completed and immediately we know who this fraudulent withdrawer is, action willbe taken. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. CHEPKOK: Mr. Speaker, Sir, hon. Dr. Wameyo asked the Assistant Minister to tell the House why the Ministry had to wait until this Question was asked before taking action? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KARIDKI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, like I said and if the hon. Member wants me to repeat action was not initiated when an action was brought to this House. Even before the hon. Member brought this Question to the House action had already started like .I explained, a letter had already been written to Mrs. Uaimondo urging her to send her photograph so that she can been issued with a new passbook. It is not true to say that action was only initiated after the hon. Member asked the Question. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Kwamzandi' s Question. </NEWSPEECH>Question No.552 Payment of the late Kea's Retirement BenefitsMR. MWAMZANDI asked the Minister for Health when the retirement benefits for the late Mr. Juma Kea, DEP 030, P/Ho. 325973, will be paid to his dependants.<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Dr. B.A. Godana): Mr.; Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to replyI wish to inform the hon. Member that the deceased was an employee of this Ministry from 1st January, 1970, to 10th August, 1979, when he retired on medical grounds0 The deceased was not due for retirement benefits at the time of his retirement because he was employed after 1st April, 1966, ana was not holding a permanent and pensionable post. He was a contributor to the National Social Security Fund and his dependants are well advised to make a claim for IT.S.S.P. benefits to the relevant office. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.MWAMZANDI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not know whether the Assistant Minister and I are talking about the same person.I say this because the person I am talking about is Mr. Juma Eea while the Assistant Minister, in his written reply, is talking about a Mrv Huma Eena. If the Assistant Minister is talking about Juma Eea, I would like to inform him that this gentleman was working with the Ministry of Health even before Independence. What has happened to all the years he worked prior to 1970? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. B.A. CODANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think the hon. Member has been rather incoherent. Could he please repeat his question? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MWAMZANDI : Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I was saying that I do not know whether we are talking about the same person. In the written reply from the Assistant Minister he is talking about Mr. Huma Eena although the personal number is the same as that of Mr. Juma Eea. In my Question I am talking about Juma Eea. If the Assistant Minister is talking about the same Juma Eea, I would like to inform him that the gentleman started working with the Ministry of Health just before Independence. That has happened to the years he worked prior to 1970? where are they? Where was he working? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. B.A. GODANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member and I are talking about the same person. This person joined the Ministry on 1st April, 1966, and retired on medical grounds on 10th August, 1979. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if this person joined the Ministry of Health on 1st April, 1966, why does he not qualify for pension? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. B.A. CODAKA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have told the hon. Member in my main reply that the individual was a contributor to then N.S.S.P. which is an alternative to the '"Pension Scheme. That is where his money is. His dependants should forward the claim to the relevant office. Indeed the Ministry of Health is quite prepared to assist. We have in fact written in a separate communication reference No 325973/23 of 30/10. 90 requesting the deceased's dependants to supply us with the necessary documents to enable them to make a claim for the N.S.S.F. benefits. The documents sought here his Identity Card and his N.S.S.F. Card; It would be useful if the hon. Member could assist the dependants to forward the documents to the Ministry. I am sure our staff will be prepared to assist them. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, in his main reply the Assistant Minister says that the deceased was an employee of the Ministry from 1st January, 1970. In the second paragraph of the same reply, the Assistant Minister says that Jurna Eea was employed by the Ministry on 1st April, 1966. Which is which? If the deceased was employed on 1st April, 1966, why does the Assistant Minister talk about 1st January, 1970? <NEWSPEECH>DR. B. A. GODANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I said that he started working on 1st January, 1970. If inadvertently, I did refer to 1st April, 1965, in ay supplementary answer, the hon. Member should understand. The correct position is reflected by what is written in my first reply. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MWAMZANDI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I need the guidance of the Chair because it appears that we are not talking about the same person. According to my Question the name of that person is Huma Eena while according to the written reply from the Assistant Minister the name of the person is Huma Eena. These are two totally different names. The Assistant Minister is therefore giving me a totally different answer. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Dr. B.A. you have referred to 30.10.90. That is when you wrote the letter. But you did mention the year 1966 and I think you should clarify that. What does that mean? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. B.A. GODANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I stated in main reply‚Äîwhich la the	veilen the hon. Member, the deceased was employed after that date; he was not EE on permanent and pensionable terms and he was, therefore, a contributor to the NSSF. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MWAMZANDI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I still insist, through the Chair, that research be done and a better reply provided. Mr. Juma Kea. When I am talking about started working with the Ministry of Health before 1970, but the reply the Assistant Minister is giving is for a different person. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir I think you will agree with me that while I am talking of Juma kea the is Assistant Minister is talking of Huma Kena, who entirely different prism. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR.BA GODANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if the hon. Memmber has any evidence that in fact, this person started working earlier than 1st January, 1970, then I think he is JESE welcome to lay it on the Table. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. You will agree with me that the Ministry of Health has i not been forthright in giving answers. Hon. Mwamzandi is disagreeing with the Assistant Minister because the name in the Order Paper is ij diffferent from the name in the Assistant Minister's reply. So, hon. Mwamzand wants to know whether the Assistant Minister is talking about the same person that hon. Mwamzandi has in mind. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. BAGODANA: Mr, Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think in response to an earlier supplementary question, √Ø I stated that we are talking about the same person, in spite of some apparent typographical error in that the personal. number we are referring to is the same both on the Orderand in my reply. So, i do not think we should try to make a mountain out of an ant hill. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MWAMZADI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir we are not talking about the same person because I am r talking of Huma Kena while the Assistant Minister is talking of Huma Kena; there is nobody in Kwale called Huma Kena who worked with the Ministry of Health. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, Mr. MwamzandiJ How do you spell the other name? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.MWAMZANDI: The name the Ministry has is "H-U-M-A-K-E-N-A". </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Dr. Godana, apparently, you quite a different name. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. BA.GODANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think the hon. Member is being a little cheeky and taking advantage of a typographical error. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is it Parliamentary language for the Assistant Minister to term the hon. Member as being "cheeky"? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Certainly it is not </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR.BA.GODANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if the term "cheeky" is un-parliamentary, then I withdraw it and apoligize. what I mean is that the hon. Member is trying to be unusually difficult without justification. You are talking about the same person because we are agreed personal number 030/325973, which appears both on the Order Paper ana my reply. Now, everybody here is reasonable enough to know that we do not have one personal number for two different employees in the public service: one personal number" belongs to one, and only one, individual. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, Dr. Godana The difficulty is that the hon. Member is alleging that Mr. Juma Kea started with the ministry way back in the 60s while in your answer you are talking about the 70s. That is one disparity and I think it is important to clarify this matter beyond doubt. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BA GODANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I said that according the .individual personal No. 030/325973, who is referred to as June, Keer and who apparently inadvertently in our reply is referred as Huma Kena, being one and the same person began---- </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. It is doubtful whether the hon. Member and the Assistant Minister are talking about the same person because it is possible for one personal file number to bear two names. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. B.A. GODANA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it should be common knowledge to everybody here that no two persons in the public service share one personal number; so we are talking about the same person.Before I was rudely interrupted, I was saying that this person, whether he is Juma Kea, the name the hon. Member is insisting on, or Huma Kena, as I think the name has been misfelt in my reply, being the same in the personal number, according to our records, started working in the Ministry in 1970. If the hon. Member has any evidence to the contrary, as I said earlier, he is wecome to lay it on the table. now, it seems he is depending to what he recollects, or own personal experience. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MWAMZANDI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. It is upon the Chair to make a ruling on this matter." I still incest that Juma Kea is not the same as Huma Kena. Secondly, this person started working when I was still school in---- </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, Mr. Mwamzandi In.that case, willy you kindly lay his letter of annoitment, which shows his date of appointment, be it 1959 or I960, on the Table. If you do not have it now, you can bring it next week; it will be very useful for the Ministry to take note of that fact </NEWSPEECH>Mr Mate's Question. Question No. 570Upgrading Siakago Health CentreMR.

DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Mukuna, apparently, the Ministry is not ready with, answer; any problem with what the Assistant Minister has said? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. we did not hear what the Assistant Minister said because he spoke softly. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE (Mr. Ngaruro): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am asking for extra time so that we can give a satisfactory answer to this Question. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.

MAKHANU asked the Minister for labour whether he could order the immediate compensation, under the Workmen's Compensation Act, of Mr. Jamin Walusekhe for injuries he received on 17th,February, 1990 while working as Security Guard No. 186, for M/S Shelter Security Services, Moi Avenue, P.O. Box 50759, Nairobi. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR X LABOUR (Mr.P.J. Masinde): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Although, Mr. Walusekhe met an accident on 17 the February, 1990, the employer did not file the necessary forms until 24th September, 1990. The forms reporting accident were received in our office on 31st October, 1990 and we are now waiting for the injury assessment of the deceased from the doctor who treated him. Once this assessment is received we shall take necessary action. I cannot, therefore, order immediate compensation to the workman due to the above facts. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.MAKHANU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, while thanking the Minister for his reply, I am just wondering why the injuries assessment report has not been sent to the Ministry? I have copies of the1; formst with me here and I would like the Minister to assure this House that he would make the necessary arrangements to have this person compensated if I laid these documents on the Table of this Eouse. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.KASINDE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, receiving the forms is one thing and getting the final assessment done is another. Obviously, it would be to the disadvantage of the worker if the assessment was made before he is fully recovered from the injuries. ?or that reason, it would be to the advantage of the worker if he could be fully recovered and have the final assessment done by the doctor so that we could take off from there. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.DEPUTY SPEAKER: very well! Let us move on to Mr. Lotin's Question </NEWSPEECH>Question No.576Payment of injuries compensation to Mr. KuriaMR.LOTHN asked the Minister for Labour when Mr. Sammy Kgugi Kuria P/No.2463, a former employee of Spie Botignoles Limited of P.O. Box 61000, Nairobi, will be paid compensation for injuries he sustained while on duty on 24th August, 1989.<NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. Kasinde): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Mr. Sammy ligugi Kuria, met. with the. accident on the 24th of August, 1999 while working for the Spie Botignoles Limited, Kitale and the company reported the accident to our labour office in Kitale immediately, that is on the 28th, August, 1989 the workman was assessed by a doctor on the 11th of Kay this year and given 20 per cent permanent incapacity. However, the doctor was not able to assess the temporary incapacity as the workman is still under‚Äî going treatment, while waiting for this person to be fully cursed, the doctor could not give the assessment but the employer objected to the assessment of 30 per cent of permanent incapacity as being too high. Therefore, he was advised to engage his own doctor for a second assessment. Vihile this was going Kr. Kuria hired a lawyer and we have ad'ised the lawyer to look for a doctor to reassess Mr. Kuria. So, we are awaiting the assessmenteither from the employer or from Mr. Kuria's lawyer. when we get this assessment, we shall definitely take the necessary action. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Lotin, you are satisfied? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.

KISOI asked the Minister for Lands and Housing(a)  how many title deeds have heen issued to Langas residents of Eldoret Municipality, and(b)  since the population of Langas is increasing, consistently, what plans the Ministry has made to ensore that adequate land is set aside for public utilities such as social amenities, hosptials nursery, primary and secondary schools. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS AND HOUSING:(Mr. Mutiso):Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to give the following reply.(a) No title deeds have been issued to Langas resident of Eldoret Municipality.(b) The Ministry has prepared a development plan for the area This has been done by and a proper layout of the plan of the plots has been prepared./taking into the need for account the existing developments and also/setting aside land for public purpose plots such as hospitals, schools, social amenities and access roads. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MISOI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, while appreciating the answer given, by the Assistant Minister could he give us the breakdown of plotthax has been set aside for hospitals, schools, social amenities and so on. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MUTTSO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, Langas was originally a farm owned by a landcraying company known as Langas Company Limited. This company subdivided the farm into 51 plots and given to individual plot owners. Subsequently, these plots owners then subdivided these plots into smaller units, of between one eighth and or tenth of EH acre plots. Now, the area has been built up without proper roads and other amenities since there was no proper planning. The world Bank has been involved	in an upgrading exercise since 1935 has translated a road to open up the area The horld Dank has also constructed a water kc kiosks which are now in use. The District Physical Planning Officer has now prepared an EK layout plan showing the individual subplots and adequate land has also been set aside for the public purpose plots. This project is row being implemented in phases as follows:In Phase I. the World Bank has constructed a main road to open up the area and this was done in I997 Later supply has also been reticulated and was kiosks provided. This has been done through a World Bank Loan and the beneficiaries are supposed to repay the loan as they get title deeds.In Phase II, survey of is ntiddbocc individual plots is going to be carried out and the Municipal Council has already advertised for a private survey to survey the area and the closing date for application is 31st October after the which the Municipal Council would award/tender for the job. I hope that satisfies x the hon. Member. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MISOI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, while appreciating the explanation given by the Assistant Minister, he has not give us the size of land that has been set aside for public utility. we would like to knew how big this land is </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MUTISO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I had already said, this land has teen subdivided into portions and these portions have been further subdivided into smaller plots ranging from oneeighth:to one‚Äîtenth of an acre. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. GEEFLOK: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister tell this House when this land was acquired by the Municipality, </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MUTISO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not have the information here with me, but what I can say with certainty is that this exercise started in 1937, but with regard to when this land was set aside, I do not know. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. CEPKOK: On a point of order, Sir. Since the Assistant Minister does not know "when this land was acquired, can he go backhand get the House a proper answer? I know that Languages is within teasing Gishu County Council and not within the Municipality. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MUTISO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, what is the relevance here with regard when this land was purchased? The main issue here is whether title deeds have been issued and how the plots have been sub‚Äîdivided. Does it really matter when the plot was purchased? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Next Question. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. CHEPKOK: On a point of order, Hon. Deputy Speaker, Sir, The Assistant Minister said that the Municipality is carrying out the survey. That is why I am asking him when the Municipality acquired the Langas plot. This is why I want him to go back and bring proper details to the House. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MUTISO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I see no difficult in doing that. I can do that next week. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Next Question. </NEWSPEECH>Question No. 560<HEADER>MEASURES TO CURB UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE COUNTRY</HEADER>MR.BIDU on behalf of Mr. Kiliku. asked the Minister for Manpower Development and Employment what concrete employment strategies he has formulated to curb unemployment which is increasing at a considerable rate.<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT AND EMPLOYMENT (Mr. OTWANI): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The Government is aware and very much concerned about the increasing unemployment situation in the country. In this respect, through his wise leadership and foresight, Elis Excellency the President recently appointed The Employment Committee to examine the employment situation in the country and suggest ways and means through TSX which the unemployment situation can be curbed. Everybody is awaiting the committee's findings, Consequently, the Ministry isTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT AND EMPLOYMENT (Mr. OTWANI) (CTD.)requesting the hon. Member for Changamwe to be patient and wait for the out of the committee's findings and subsequent implementation of its recommendations. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. NDETEI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are aware of the appointment of the committee set up recently by the President to look into the unemployment problems and maize the Sets necessary recommendations. But we are also aware of the creation of the Ministry of Manpower Development and Employment. what is this Ministry doing if it cannot do some of these jobs that it has to wait until a committee is appointed so do the job it is supposed to do? Can the Assistant Minister tell the Souse the relevance of that Ministry to what this particular committee is doing? Can he explain that? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OTWANI: Mr. Deputy Speaker. Sir, the Ministry is not idle now; it is doing a lot. For instance, the Ministry has a number of strategies to attend to, so such as, District Focus Strategy for Rural Development. Since a lot of hopes have currently been placed on employment generation through small scale and Juan kali enterprises, the Government has intensified its efforts to promote these entrepreneurs in order to create more jobs and income earning opportunities in the rural areas hence occupying most of the rural people from migrating into urban centres.This strategy is also out to relieve the agricultural sector of the redundant labour force, as they will find alternative jobs and income earning opportunities within the rural nonfarm activities. The Ministry has ensured that there are PTU; employment offices in all the districts. So far, we have opened offices in 31 districts and them in full operation. These offices are being strengthened in terms of staffing and facilities. The exercise is continuing and soon all the remaining districts will have employment offices.Another strategy is to show that the Ministry is not idle that the Ministry has initiated and is currently implementing .a project funded by the International Labour Organisation (ILC), UNDP and UNFPA. This strategy is aimed at strengthening employment planning and labour market information. This project will go a long way in strengthening the national employment market information system through a streamlined and computerized data collection system in the district to enable easier coordination and placement of job seekers.The strategy behind this project is to improve the mechanism for collecting the necessary data information, processing analyses and collecting the results for purposes of dissemination and use to support employment and labor planning exercise at the local level. This will is done through improved design of data collection methodologies, establishing appropriate baseline information, undertaking labour force survey and studies which are addressed key sectors of population where priority is needed.The project will also carry out a detailed determinacy of female labour force that shall be utilized for appropriate policies and planning or promote women's issues in development. The project will undertake to explore the understanding of the impact of population growth on employment and income variables. The relationship of which is largely unexplored as of now.There will be studies and programmes at the districts to s¬£53csx analyse the impact of rural development and investment on the districts so as to explore possible employment opportunities. The income distribution implication of such investment strategies will assist in planning for policies to check the rural/urban migration.The Ministry is, therefore, not doing nothing. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MRS. NDETEI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, what the Assistant Minister has outlined here is not new; it is something we have known since 1972. If the Assistant Minister is careful enough to go and look at the ILO Report which was X2 written in 1972, he will find that what he has read was outlined in 1972. But what the hon. Questioner wants to know are the plans the Ministry has to create employment. According to the Assistant Minister's reply, it seems as though the Ministry is managing by crisis. What future plans deeps the Ministry have to ensure that the situation is not repeated. For exampleMRS.NDETEI (CTD.)during the last few months, there has been much loss of employment by parasail bodies and other organisations and yet the Ministry has not issued a Ministerial Statement to the effect that these bodies have security of tenure for their employees. Loss of employment only‚Äô increases the unemployment problem that is facing the country. what long term measures is the Ministry working on now, alongside this committee, to ensure that the unemployment problem is alleviated in this country. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OTWANI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I hope you will protect me when I say that I do not want to pre-empt the outcome of the current committee on employment. The Ministry is right within that committee. It is very represented by its directors. The outcome of this committee is not going to be different from what the Ministry is planning, without pre-empting the outcome of this committee, I will ask the hon. Members to be patient and wait for the recommendations of try this committee because it is part of the wholes plan. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>KR. KIPKORIR: Kr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister should also be responsible for the jobseekers who come to Parliament gate to wait for hon. Members to go help them. Instead of coining here, they should all go to his office for assistance. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OTWANI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, that is why the Ministry thought that it was not enough to have one central office in Nairobi. The Ministry is opening offices in all districts so that jobseekers do not have to depend on one office in the headquarters. Instead, they can go to district offices and get all the necessary assistance that is being offered there now. </NEWSPEECH>Question No. 539<HEADER>Coffee Payments to Farmers "in Kitutu Masaba" </HEADER>MR. A.H.O. KOMANYI asked the Minister for Cooperative Development when the coffee farmers of Gesarara and Kemera Co‚Äîoperative Societies will be paid their dues.<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR COOPERATIVE DEERLOPMENT (Mr. Ejore): Mr. Deputy Speaker., Sir, I beg to reply.During the 1989/90 season, Gesarara Farmers Co‚Äîoperative Society delivered to the Kenya Planters Cooperative Union (K.P.C.U.) parchment which was valued at Shs.917, 102.80. So far, this society has paid its coffee farmers Shs566,272.50. There is, however, a balance of Shs.343, 903.50 which the society will pay the farmers as soon as it receives the money from the K.P.C.U.In the case of Kemera Farmers Co‚Äîoperative Society, the society has received Shs.356, 418.95 for the parchment which it delivered to the K.P.C.U. during the 1989/90 season. The society did not deliver any coffee to the K.P.C.U. during the 1988/89 season as the crop was destroyed by hail stones. Therefore, it had to meet the expenses of the two seasons from the sale of the 1989/90 crop.<NEWSPEECH>MR. A.H.O. MOMANYI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is the said balances of payment that I am asking about. The other money was paid last year, and the Assistant Minister has said that the balance will be paid as soon as possible. When exactly is he going to pay these balances? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. EJORE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is working with the KR. EJORE (CTD.)K.P.C.U. to make sure that the balances owed to farmers of Gesarara and Kemera Farmers Cooperative Societies are paid them quickly. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KIPKORIR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, delay in payment of farmers dues frustrates farmers to such an extent that they no longer work hard. Why should the Ministry take such a long time to pay farmers their dues? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. EJORE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is not the Ministry that delays payment of this money, but farmers cooperative societies and the K.P.C.U. If they process sale of farmers crops and payment for them in time, that is all right. This is why the Ministry is coming in and telling these societies to pay farmers as soon ELS their crops are sold. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. A.H.O. MOMANYI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister has said that there is a balance of Shs.343,903.50 remaining to be paid to farmers of Gesarara Farmers Co‚Äîoperative Society. When exactly is this balance going to be paid? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. EJORE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the problem does not now lie with the said farmers but with the K.P.C.U., and we have asked it to pay them quickly. </NEWSPEECH>Question No. 520<HEADER>Reasons for Termination of Services: Mr. Moses Kipserem</HEADER>MR. CHPKOK asked the Attorney‚ÄîGeneral why the services of Mr. Moses Kipserem, formerly stationed at the District Magistrate's Court, Item, were terminated and he will be paid his total dues.<NEWSPEECH>THE ATTORNEY-GENEAL (Mr. Muli): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Mr. Moses Kipserem was appointed as a subordinate staff with the Ministry of Energy on 18th July, 1930. He was transferred to the Judiciary on 1st November, 1983. While in both the Ministry of Energy and the Judiciary, he became a habitual absentee and deserter from duties without permission. According to records, Mr. Kipserem deserted duties on 8th September, 1987 and his whereabouts were unknown. His salary was, therefore, stopped and Mr. KipseremTHE ATTORNEY‚ÄîGENERAL (Mr. Muli) (CTD.)served with a show‚Äîcause letter. The matter was reported to the District Advisory Committee at Item. His case was deliberated upon and he was dismissed from service with effect from 8th September, 1987 because of desertion from duty. However, before he received his letter of dismissal on 2nd February, 1988, he had reported on duty on 26th October, 1987. He, therefore, worked up .to and including 2nd February, 1988. He ceased to work on 3rd February', 1988. Accordingly, arrangements are at hand to pay him his final dues. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. CHEPKOK: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Attorney General has told the House that when Mr. Kipserem was in both the Ministry of Energy and the Judiciary, he was a habitual absentee. If this is so, why was he transferred from the Ministry of Energy to the Judiciary? How could you transfer the problem? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MULI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not follow hon. Chepkok's supplementary question, but the transfer of Mr. Kipserem from the Ministry of Energy to the Judiciary was perfectly normal. However, as I have said, in both the Ministry of Energy and the Judiciary, he had become a habitual absentee and his service was unsatisfactory. His service was terminated in the normal manner and a letter of termination issued. So he should go to the office where he last served to get his terminal benefits. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. CHEPKOK: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I still maintain that the Attorney‚ÄîGeneral, is misleading the House. There are only three people in the law courts at Item that is the Magistrate, the Clerk and the subordinate staff. This person was allowed to work there for 3.5 months while his case was being looked into by the District Advisory Committee. Why was this allowed? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MULI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I did say that whereas the man was away on his habitual absenteeism, he eventually turned up on 26th October and his previous absenteeism was overlooked. His three months work was accounted for as part of his service. His services were consequently terminated on 2nd February, 1988. So, the three months he worked up to February were included in his terminal payments. I think he should be advised to go there and have his dues worked out. I do not think there is any misleading I can be accused of by my friend, hon. Chepkok. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. CHEPKOK: Mr. Deputy Speaker, sir, it is well known that nobody can absent himself from duty for three months. It is said that he was known to be a habitual absentee and yet he was transferred to the Judicial Department. When he was in Item, he absented himself and the advisory committee, of which the magistrate is a member, met and allowed the man to work until his services were terminated in February. That means that there must be something wrong between the magistrate or the other officer in Item. Can the Attorney General tell the House exactly what happened to this man? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MULI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I hope you understand my friend hon. Chepkok's point because I have explained how everything happened. The man reported back to work in October and was accepted back. He then worked for three months and those months, prior to his services termination in February were accounted for, I do not see what hon. Chepkok now Wants. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. CHEPKOK: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: No, I overrule you. Let us now go back to Mr. Mate's Question. </NEWSPEECH>Question No. 570<HEADER>Upgrading of Siakago Health Centre</HEADER><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: If Mr. Mate is still not in, we now go to Questions by Private Notice. </NEWSPEECH>(Question dropped)<NEWSPEECH>MR. CHEPKOK: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order. Mr. Chepkok, I overruled you and you stand overruled. Let us go on now. </NEWSPEECH><HEADER>QUESTIONSBY PRIVATE NOTICE</HEADER><HEADER>Removal of Boundary Beacons between Kamologon and Sigor</HEADER><NEWSPEECH>MR. KIPKORIR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, sir, I beg to ask. The Minister of State, Office of the President the following Question by Private Notice.(a) Why were the boundary beacons separating Kamologon in Elegy/ Market and Signor Division of West Picot removed?(b) What action is the Minister taking to restore tranquillity among wananchi living along the boundary of these two districts? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Kamuren): Mr. Deputy" Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(a) It is suspected that the boundary beacons separating Kamologon in Elgeyo Marakwet and Sigor Division of West Pokot were removed by people searching for mercury. My Ministry has, however, instructed the district surveyors of the involved areas to restore the pillars along the common border as soon as possible.(b) Tranquillity thrives among the wananchi living along the boundary of the two districts. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KIPKORIR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, what proves that there is mercury in that place to prove the claim that the people searching for the mercury are the ones who could have removed the pillars? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KAMUREN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for the benefit of the hon. Member, may I give the following supplementary information in connection with this Question. Along the boundary in question, there are normally two types of pillars. One, there is the Survey of Kenya triangle pillar and, second, boundary pillars. In the area in question, both types have been vandalised by people most likely in search of mercury. This practise is not unique in Elgeyo Marakwet as it has been experienced even in otherMR. KAMUREN (CTD.)parts of the country. The practice has, to say the least, not posed a threat to security on the border in question. Wananchi living along the said boundary have not experienced incidences of lawlessness. There has been no report of lack of tranquility. Hon. Robert Kipkorir went to the District Commissioner's office at Item on Monday of this month and raised the same matter. The District Commissioner assured him that the matter was receiving the necessary attention and that the pillars would be replaces soon. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KIPKORIR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this issue has taken a long time. I first visited the place in 1986 and the pillars had been removed then. The District Commissioner who accompanied me there assured me that the necessary replacements would be made. Up to now nothing has been done. I would like the Assistant Minister to assure this House when those pillars are going to be replaced. This is because wananchi of Elgeyo Marakwet believe that those who e removed the pillars are from West Pokot who want to extend their area. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KAMUREN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the people of Elgeyo Marakwet and West Pokot have continued to enjoy peace and we have been receiving reports from the District Commissioners from those two places regarding the security situation in the area. There is no alarm at all. I would like to request the hon. Member to wait for the action soon to be taken by the surveyors, who will replace those pillars very soon. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. CHEPKOK: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, can the Assistant Minister assure the House that they had the reports that the beacons were actually removed? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>HON. MEMBERS: He said so. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. CHEPKOK: If so, who removed them? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KAMUREN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I did say, also, that the people who probably removed the pillars are those who normally prospect for mercury. Up to now there has never been cases of insecurity there at all. </NEWSPEECH>MR. KAMUREN (CTD.)The people in that area have been enjoying peace and living together harmoniously. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. CHEPKOK: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. As hon. Members from Elgeyo Marakwet, we know that there were problems created by the people of West Pokot, who removed the beacons. They then moved into the area. We made a visit during the last Parliament with the District Conmissioner to preach peace. How can the Assistant Minister then claim here that the pillars were removed by prospectors of mercury? How can prospectors look for mercury in the forest? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Chepkok, that was not a point of order. <NEWSPEECH>MR. EKIDOR: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker Sir. Hon. Chepkok has claimed that the beacons were removed by some people from West Pokot. Can he substantiate that and give the dates when that was done? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. CHEPKOK: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is known and even if one were to follow up the matter, the district commissioners in Item and even West Pokot can confirm that. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KAMUREN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I said that hon.Kipkorir was with the Elgeyo Marakwet District Conmissicner on 5th of this month. The District Commissioner assured the hon. Member that the replacement of the pillars was going to be carried out as soon as possible. Therefore, there is no cause for alarm in this case. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KIPKORIR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, I would like to confirm to hon. Kamuren that. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Address the Chair, but not hon. Kamuren. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KIPKORIR: I would like to assure the House, that there is a man known as Mr. Kawertich. His house was burnt down. We are very peacefully in Elgeyo Makakwet and we do not want any chaos. We have decided to implement the philosophy of love, peace and unity. We would like the Assistant Minister to go and tell this people to move away from Elgeyo Marakwet immediately. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KAMUREN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, hon. Kipkorir is empasising a point; he is not crying, if I may help in this one. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. arap. CHEPKOK: On a point of order, Sir. . . . . </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: What is your point of order, Mr. arap Chepkok. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. arap CHEPKOK: Can the Minister now agree, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir . . . . </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Overuled. Can you respond to the first question, Mr. Kamuren? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. NANGOLE: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speakers Sir. I rise on the point of order regarding what hon. Kipkorir has just said. He has alleged that it is the people of West Pokot who have removed these pillars. He further said that a man by the name Kawertich was disturbed,, but, because the people of Elgey√≥ Marakwet are peace loving citizens who leve unity. This one is an implication which shows that it is the people of West Pokot who do not maintain peace and unity and if the situation is left like that we are going to cause some misunderstanding between the people of West Pokot who are presentlyMR. NANGOLE (CTD.)living in peace.as the hon. assistant Minister has confirmed. Can hon. Kipkorir substantiate or withdraw what he has said, or else he confirms the date when people of West Pokot removed the pillars. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KIPKORIR; Mr. Deputy Speaker, sir, I have confirmed to the House, that Mr. Kawertich's house has been burnt. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>HON MEMBERS: By whom? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KIPKORIR: By people from West Pokot, but I cannot tell exactly who they are. But, if he wants me to produce that man, I can bring him here, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The man has come to complain to me very bitterly and even the District Commissioner, knows about this case. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. LOTIM: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, can the hon. Kipkorir Pprove that people of West Pokot burnt Mr. Kawertich's house? Secondly, can he substantiate the same people removed the beacons? He has said that they have held some meetings on the border. I can assure the House that there has never been any border clash between the West Pokot and Elgeyo Marakwet from 1965 up to now. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon. Kipkorir, can you substantiate or withdraw that statement? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KIPKORIR; I will not withdraw, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, There is evidence to show that these people have moved to Elgeyo Marakwet. I have gone there myself and witnessed the same. I have told the District Commissioner about the case. I asked them to move to the other side, but I feel that it is the DC who should do that. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: I will allow, Mr. Kamuren, to contribute to that. </NEWSPEECH>MR. KAMUREN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, when the hon. Kipkorir was discussing the matter with the District Commissioner, Elgeyo Marakwet, he did not give a name of the any single person as having the ever made the mistake the beacons along the boundry.I would like to say that we do not want to alarm peaceful Nyayo people living along Elgeyo-Markwet and West Pokot boundaries. We allowed the District Commissioners in those areas to contact the surveyors in those districts to install the pillars in terms of what had been discussed. I did contact the District Commissioner‚Äôs Elgeyo Marakwet and West Pokot this morning and they are of the opinion that they should install these pillars immediately.MR. NANGOLE: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker Sir. I kindly ask you to request, Mr Kipkorir, to withdraw or substantiate his remarks?<NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Kipkorir, actually there is not difficulty in this because, if you do not have the facts in the interests of good order and in view of the fact that there is likely to be a border misunderstanding, The Chair, pleads with you to withdraw that remark, if you cannot prove it. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KIPKORIR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, what proof do I have to give; when the owner of the house has come to see me and he has told me the whole story and I have told the hon. Member that it is true? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: Order, Mr. Kipkorir , the Chair to will not allow flaring of tempers to me and I plead with you to withdraw that remark in the interest of good order and neighbourliness, between the people of Elgeyo Marakwet and West Pokot. There is absolutely no difficulty with that. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KIPKORIR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will not withdraw, because the house has been burnt. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KAMUREN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. a ruling from the Chair ever since, if we do understand the Standing Orders of this House properly, is always respected by each and every Member of this House. Secondly, Mr. Speaker Sir, if the hon. Member is claiming that this is a Pokot from Kapenguria or West Polot that ever removed the beacons and that the house was burnt by people from West Pokot, then he meant to say that it was people from Elgeyo Marakwet hownet and burnt the house of this man after removing the beacons. So, it is not possible for a person from West Pokot to remove the beacons and get another person from the same area to come and burn the house of a person who lives in West Pokot. So, I would like to abide by your ruling, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, that with alarming or causing any misunderstanding between the people of West Pokot and Elgeyo Marakwet, the hon. Member should withdraw that allegation. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Order! Order! Mr. Kipkorir, is it your wish to walk out of the Chamber, I thought you we're just walking out. So, if it is your wish to walk out, we can obviously allow you to do that. But, it is not a light matter. We are talking about good order between the people of West Pokot and the people of Elgeyo Marakwet and unless you are able to prove that the person who burnt this particular house is from West Polot, you cannot get away with it lightly. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KIPKORIR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if the hon. Member would like to accompany me, we could go tomorrow and I would show him the ash. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Order! Unfortunately, the matter is now before the whole1 House, and you either prove it before the House or withdraw your remark, Mr. Kipkorir. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KIPKORIR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have seen it but I could not bring the ashes to this House. However, if you want me to bring the ashes, I can do so next week. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KAMUREN: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, in connection with the issue which is getting a little bit out of hand because it is very serious, the ruling from the Chair is adequate. What the hon. Member should do is to withdraw his allegation because he cannot substantiate who burned the houses. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Kipkorir, I now order you to withdraw those remarks. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KIPKORIR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if you want me to withdraw the remarks, then I had better go out. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>HON. MEMBERS: Withdraw! Withdraw! </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, hon. Members! Hon. Kipkorir has the Floor. I have ordered, him to withdraw the remark. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KIPKORIR: I had better go out, Mr. Deputy Speaker, if you want me to withdraw something which I have seen with my own eyes. </NEWSPEECH>(Noise)<NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, hon. Members! Under those circumstances, Mr. Kipkorir, you therefore force the Chair to order to leave the precincts of the House. In view of your inability to substantiate the allegation the allegation that the house you referred to was burned by a person from West Pokot and in view of your unwillingness to withdraw the remark, I order you to leave1 the Chamber for the rest of the day. </NEWSPEECH>(Mr. Kipkorir withdrew from the Chamber)<NEWSPEECH>KR. J.N. KUNGAI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. This is a very sensitive question, in view of the fact that it is involving two neighbouring districts in the country. It may be possible that there could be some truth in this matter, thereby making the hon. Member, maybe, to incite the situation. </NEWSPEECH>KR. J.N. MUNGAI (CTD.)In view of the fact that we want peace in this country, and taking into account the fact that we would not like to cause chaos between different communities or tribes, would it be in order for the Minister of State, Office of the President, who is here now, to organise a meeting between the two district commissioners, the Members of Parliament from those areas and other leaders to go and ascertain the truth. From what we have heard from the hon. Member who has just walked out, it seems as if he has some certainty about the matter. <NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Fortunately, the Leader of Government comes from that area and I suppose we may benefit from him. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Mr. Biwott): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think the hon. Assistant Minister had answered the Question very well, that there: is peace and tranquility along that border. I have personally been there and I had a meeting between the two peoples and I know that there is absolute peace. But, as usual, the two villages have had small dispute's. I think what will happen is that the suggestion made by the Assistant Minister will apply, the two district commissioners, Members of Parliament from the area and other elders will settle the matter amicably.There should be no cause for alarm because these people know each other very we'll; they have lived all this time together and I do not think there will be any incitement. What you saw here was the demonstration of all that we have been telling wananchi, that an African in his own area is a very difficult man and a Mzungu will never understand him. Unajua. You know, Sir, the Kalenjin people are very tough and there is no way hon. Kipkorir could have withdrawn his remarks because he would have lost praise in his own area. And there was no way the hon. Members from Pokot could have allowed this to go unchallenged because1 they would also have had problem's. The two were perched together and there was no way either of them could have backed out.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, a solution will be found and I do not think those two who do not come from that area will worry. There will be absolute peace THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY (CTD.)and hon. Kamuren knows that because he was a Member of Parliament for that particular area at one time. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MWAMZANDI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think, under our Standing Orders, Mr. Kipkorir‚Äôs behaviour is what may be referred to as gross misconduct. Normally, under such circumstances, an hon. Member is named by a Cabinet Minister so that he is thrown out of the House for a number of days. In fact, he is not allowed to enter the precincts of Parliament Buildings. But what we have seen is that hon. Kipkorir just walked out without being named. Can We assume that he has walked out on his own today and when he comes later he will be named so that he goes out for the: stipulated number of days? That was gross misconduct. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: On the contrary, Mr. Mwamzandi, I go by the provision of Standing Order No. 88(1), and I am satisfied that that was disorderly conduct and not gross misconduct. Therefore, having asked Mr. Kipkorir to leave the Chamber for the rest of the day is sufficient. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. LOTIM: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Just to revisit the same issue, I would like to state that nobody from West Pokot has burned anybody's house and we have not removed any beacon from the border. To me I think the Elgeyo/Marakwet are trying to incite the situation and see how the Pokot people will react to the issue. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, Mr. Lotim. We must go on. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Mr. Biwott): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I wish to appeal to the hon. Members from the two districts to leave the matter with the provincial administration. The two district commissioners, the Members of Parliament and other elders from the two districts will be able to solve this problem. I believe that hon. Members are also going to contribute to the situation. I do not there is a big problem; it is only a small problem which has been blown out of proportions. In any case, it is not the first time that those people have had exchange's. The problem, I know, has been going on for some time and I amTHE MINISTER FOR ENERGY (CTD.)sure that the district commissioners and other leaders are trying to solve the problem. If we give the chance to the provincial administration, the truth will emerge and will be known to everybody. So, let us not inflame something that does not require inflamation. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Lotim's Question by Private Notice. </NEWSPEECH>Measures to Curb Menengitis in Kapenguria<NEWSPEECH>MR. LOTIM: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Health the following Question by Private Notice.What urgent steps is the Ministry taking to cure the spread of menengitis in Kapehguria Constituency, particularly within the community living around Kapkecha Primary School?THE ASSISTANT MINISTER POR HEALTH (Mr. Ogur): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Following a Keningitis alert in Kapenguria Constituency recently a health team iron Kapenguria has visited Kapkecha Primary School and its environs. The investigations so far have revealed no evidence of Lleningitis in the area. However, few patients have been diagnosed to have malaria. The local health 2 authorities have embarked on health education JBHSEEESSX measures to explain symptoms of meningitis and other diseases and the need to report to the nearest health facility promptly when they fall sick. </NEWSPEECH>MR. OG√úR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if it is not meningitis then what is the name of this disease which has claimed the lives six of pupils from Kapkecha Primary School and several adults from that area?Mr. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this disease is not Meningitis, what has so far been diagnosed has been confirmed to be malaria. Our officers are already there to carry out investigations. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. WAMEYO: On a point of order, Lir. Deputy Speaker, Sir. That supplementary question was very specific, what killed the four children and the six adults? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, what caused those deaths is not meningitis! </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. WAMEYO: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister should not be allowed to get away with this. He has said that it is not Meningitis that killed‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: I am in agreement with you Dr. Wameyoi Proceed, Mr. Ogur! </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>Mr. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have been asked to determine what disease has affected people around Kapkecha Primary School.A team of officers from the Ministry went there to carry out investigations and their investigations have revealed that it was not Meningitis hut malaria. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: But, Mr. Ogur, the question was very specific. What disease hilled the 10 people? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we do not know about the 10 people who are said to have died. But our investigations revealed the existence of malaria around that area. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. J.N. MUNGAI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think the Assistant Minister is taking this matter very, very lightly. Ten-people are very many people. They did not go on a safari; they are dead. This has caused a lot of distress within the families concerned. The Assistant Minister should tell us what killed these people. If he does not have any reply now he should ask for permission to go and carry HESX out thorough investigations and report back to this House. He should come back and make a Ministerial Statement as to whether it was real malaria or it was another disease, if not Ma meningitis. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, who are these ten people who died? Where did they die? What were their ages? Nobody has died of meningitis in that area!<NEWSPEECH>MR. LOTIN: I do not think the Assistant Minister got the correct answer from his officers in the field. The area we are talking about is a cool place. It is not a malaria infected area. I know the Medical Officer of Health for that area and he told me that they carried out some investigations and they established that certain it is a certain kind of meningitis that killed these people.?I do not know why the Assistant Minister is talking about malaria when I know very well that there is no malaria in that area. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>Mr. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have one example here. The team which visited a home in Kapkecha area, where one person who was only a visitor from Alane Division in Kapenguria had died and‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì A post-mortem report confirmed a diagnosis of malaria and no meningitis. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>Mr. KIRWA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think it is high time the Assistant Minister for Health, Mr. Ogur, was told to treat this House with the seriousness it deserves. Ten people have died in a constituency but the Assistant Minister is taking the matter lightly. He says that only one person was examined and they realised that the cause of death was not meningitis. Could the Assistant Minister tell the House what killed the other nine people? What disease were they suffering from? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>Mr. OGUR: When we send our officers or expert to an area they do diagnosis and the result is malaria and not meningitis. That is the information the Ministry has from that area. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. WAMEYO: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister says that investigations carried out by experts from the Ministry revealed that the disease was malaria but could he tell us what type of malaria it was? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>Mr. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is a killing malaria! </NEWSPEECH>(Prolonged laughter)<NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Order! </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. NDETEI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think the Assistant Minister is not serious because all strains of malaria are killers. Could he be specific and tell us the type of malaria that killed ten people all of a sudden? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if I should bring to this House all types of malaria--- If it is the wish of this House that I bring the names of all types of malaria ‚Äî and particularly the type which killed these people then I will do exactly that. A post-mortem has been carried out on the dead people who have since been buried. I do not know how my Ministry will go about it. But I will try. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. EKIDOR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister tell the House which type of malaria kills and which type does not kill? I ask this because malaria and meningitis are both killer diseases. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OG√úR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, when one falls sick it is only the clinical officer or the doctor who is able to make a diagnosis to determine the disease the person is suffering from . If a sick person is suffering from malaria and is not taken to hospital he may die. That is killer malaria. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MWAMZANDI: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister is misleading the whole nation. He has been asked to tell us what type of malaria killed these people. There are various types of malaria like cerebral malaria and they all kill. Could he be specific and answer the question? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as suggested by the hon. Member, all strains of malaria are killer malaria! </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MRS. NBETEI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister deny or confirm whether there is meningitis or whether there is no meningitis around Hapkecha Primary School? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there are other areas with meningitis and I can say that there is no meningitis around that school. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. LOTIM: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister has admitted that only one person died. What is he going to say when I bring the names of the other people who died? He is talking about the death of one person who was a visitor, what about the residents of that area? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not see how the hon. Member can bring the names of s the people who died without any post-mortem report to show the cause of the deaths. It will not serve any purpose. When does dies and a post-mortem is performed that is when we can know the cause of death. In this case nobody died of meningitis; only of malaria. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>Mr. KIRWU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, could the Assistant Minister whether the hon. Member's allegation that some two people died is true. If it is not true, could he tell us whether the other two people the hon. Member is talking about were examined by a doctor that he is referring to or not? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if no post-mortem was done, there was no way of proving that the two people died of the same disease. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KIRWA: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. In this kind of confusion I do not think it is safe for us to just let the Assistant Minister go without him giving us a clear undertaking that he will bring a better answer to the House, if people n have died and we are just playing it around with a lot of humour here, is going to paint a very bad picture in the eyes of the public. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have accepted that we can only determine the cause of death when a post-mortem has been performed. In this case, if no post-mortem was performed on the two people who died, we cannot prove the cause of their death. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Ogur, have you also accepted that you do not know the type of malaria that killed the one individual? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>Mr. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have said I can answer that if I go back and find out the cause of death. But, how 1 will do that when the people have long been buried? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>Mr. BIDU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is it in order for the Assistant Minister to be standing and looking at you when you are talking as if he wants to quarrel you? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Ogur, I suppose you have heard that. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KILLU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, since the Assistant minister promised to give us more information on this issue, could he tell us when he give us this information? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OG√úR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, sir, it might take long; I will ask the Ministry to see if the two deceased could, with the permission of the clan, he exhumed and have the post-mortem performed on them. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KILLU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Sneaker, Sir. It has been the habit of the Assistant Minister not to give the House a concrete answer. Whenever he has to answer a Question here, he keeps on talking in circles and we end up getting nothing from him. Could the Chair assist the hon. Member to be able to get answers from this Assistant Minister? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Kiilu, I thought the Assistant Minister said he would do everything possible to bring the answer here. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OGUR: Mr. Deputy Speaker, I will do all that I can to liaise with the clan and see if the bodies of the two deceased could be exhumed and a post-mortem performed on them. I understand that the post-mortem was, probably, not performed because the clans religion does not allow it; so, may be, it will not be the wish of the clan to have the post-mortem performed. </NEWSPEECH><HEADER>POINT OF ORDER</HEADER><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINIISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Nassir): Jambo In nidhemu, Bw.

Member for Mvita has a matter which, I think, is of concern to all Kenyans. He may have given the impression: that the security forces should have apprehended the fugitive before he left this country. But first of all, let us look at the situation.Mr. Hbajah, who is now a refugee, is the brother of the late Dr. Robert Ouko and nobody could have expected the man who was closest to the late Dr. Ouko to run away, in fact, if---- </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Biwott):anybody was to run away, it should have hear: somebody else and. the one who was closest to the late Ouko and who should have been available first of all, assit the Commission of Inquiry and secondly, even for his own sake, to assist the Commission to establish the truth as to the cause of the death of his own brother.Again, Kenya is a big country with borders that stretch for miles, most of it covered by bush, rivers and so on. So, nobody knows how the man could have escaped because it is easy to escape for somebody who wants to do that. But that does not absorb the security forces from, being vigilant.THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Biwott) (CTD.)However, this matter is still under investigations at the moment and when the truth is known, I think wananchi will he told how the man escaped. I do not know what relationship there is between the disappearance of Mr. Kbajah and that of Mr. Gibson Kamau Kuria, but I hope that those countries that are friendly to Kenya will assist us in difficult situations such as this one. Everybody says that Dr. Ouko was a very good mar and that his death was a big loss to Kenya and even the countries that view hold that view today, were among those who praised the late Mr. Robert Ouko. We hope that in the search for the truth regarding the death of Dr. Cuko, these countries will come forward to assist us with any information that might assist the Commission. At the moment, however, I think it would be premature to cast das doubt on this integrity and the efficacy of our security forces because we do not know exactly how the man disappeared. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Kr. Kassir): On a point of order, Kr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, ---</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: No! I am not going to allow any discussion on this matter Mr. Nassir because you rose on a point of order in the first place and the Deputy Leader of Government Business has responded to it and you cannot again try to raise another point of order, unless, of course, it is on another entirely different matter.Next Order! </NEWSPEECH><HEADER>BILL</HEADER><HEADER>Second Reading</HEADER><HEADER>The Kenya Medical Training College Bill</HEADER>THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Kibaki): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move that the Kenya Medical Training College Bill, be read a Second Time. The Medical Training Centre as it has been called until recently, was established in 1927, way back before many of the hon. Members of this House were born. It was in 1984 that the name of that college was changed to that of the College of Health Profession. This name tends to be confused withTHE MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Biwott) (CTD.)the name of the College of Health Sciences which is a faculty of the University. This is one of the reasons why we proposed that this particular college or training centre be called The Kenya Medical Training College. This will become the permanent name of this college from now onwards.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the purpose of this Bill is to establish that college as a semi-autonomous institution which will have its own board of management and which will be able to train all the paramedical personnel that we need to train in this country. This college is training these paramedical staff up to this moment and as many hon. Members may know, there are 14 different faculties in this particular college and the training of the paramedical staff in such disciplines as clinical medicines, health education, environmental health science, medical laboratory technology, nursing, pharmacy, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, diagnostic radiography, medical record technology, dental health and medical education.In all these disciplines, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have students attending this college each year. In the management of our health institutions in this country, this calibre of personnel is absolutely critical and it is they who make cur various health instituions to run. Right now, we have slightly more than 2,000 students in this college and 200 teaching staff and another 200 staff who do other jobs. This college therefore, is a very important institution in the future of medicine, and it is important that it is administered efficiently and effectively. For this reason, we have thought it wise to remove it from being a mere department of the Ministry of health to becoming a full college with its own board of management and powers to recruit staff and promote them, and with powers to tender for the various things that, they need. In this way, they will be able to recruit staff who are specialized in teaching, it is now, when it is run as a department of the Ministry of health, people teaching in this college are from time to time transferred back to the Ministry or referred to district hospitals and to all sorts of places. So, we want this institution to acquire its own separate identity so that it car. promote the development of a curriculum and be able to liaise with similar institutions internationally which are undertaking this line of training.THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Biwott) (CTD.)As it is, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are spending some ¬£3 million each year on Both recurrent and development for this particular college and in its constituent colleges in the various towns throughout Kenya. Our intention, therefore, is to set up a board which will manage this institution. This board will also manage the other institutions that are listed in the schedule to this Bill. These institutions are situated in Mombasa, Machakos, Embu, Meru, Myeri, Murng'a, Garissa, Kakuru, doret, Kakamega, kisumu, kisii, Homa-Bay, Karen and Mathare Hospital. Incidentally, this hospital should be called Mathare because that is its proper name. The name Mathari has no meaning at all. It came about as a result of some English people who could not pronounce proper African names.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, these other institutions associated with the Kenya Medical Training College will have smaller boards managing the institutions at their own localities and they in turn will grow to become very serious training institutions. Training in every Government department is in very critical to development in/the future and therefore, it is important enough that we allocate/resources for training. I am saying this because without training we cannot grow, nor can we become as effective as we would like to be. Therefore, we must make sure that training is done effectively and as quickly as possible and above all, we should make sure that we give our people the relevant training to the economy of Kenya and what the society in Kenya generally requires.(Mr. Deputy Speaker left the Chair)(The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mrs. Ndetei) took the Chair)THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY (Biwott) (CTD.)Finally, the purposes of the Bill are not very large since its elaboration is purely on the institutions that shall be set up. We need a lot of nurses since we only have about 12,000 of them working. We still want to train larger numbers. I should, make it clear that we shall move a small amendment to this Bill at the Committee Stage to make it quite clear that the enrolment, -examination, registration of nurses and their discipline will continue to be managed and governed under the Nurses Act. This Act was established a long time ago and there is a registration board for nurses; they have their own management and they supervise the teaching syllabus. They do that job efficiently and effectively and there is no intention to change that.The other 14 disciplines I have just mentioned, will all come under the Academic Board of this particular College. So that the syllabus for all the other 14 disciplines will be set up by the Academic Board of this College. But the Nurses Council under the Nurses Act Chapter 257 will continue to be set up by the Nurses Council so that they have that independence and arrangement which incidentally is universal in all countries in. the world. we want to continue to be that way.I do not have much to add to this Bill except to recommend it to hon. Members.I beg to move. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli): Madam Temporary Deputy Speaker, I rise to second this Bill entitled "The Kenya Medical Training College Bill". The Minister responsible for this institution has given the policy aspect of the Bill whose aim is to bring under one umbrella several faculties which exist and scattered all over but administered under the Ministry of Education as a department. They have had not blue print of their individual existence and a lot of manpower has been wasted in the past.The main object of this Bill as you have read in my Memorandum of Objects and Reasons is to bring these faculties and institutions together.THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (CTD.)There are several faculties or institutions which have remained, static and the Minister has mentioned them. Just to emphasize and to declare what we are doing, they are clinical medicine, field education, environmental health and science, medical laboratory technology and nursing. Although the nursing aspect as the Minister has explained will be removed from this Bill so that the nurses aspect of education, registration and training will continue to be administered under the Nurses Act. I think it is proper that the institution of the nurses which has existed and has done a wonderful job should not be amalgamated in that umbrella which may even affect their day to today learning and servicing.That one will come up although the Chief Nursing Officer will be a member of the Academic Board of this institution that we are creating.The other faculties are pharmacy, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, diagnostic radiography, medical records technology, oral health or dental and medical education. These institutions are well mentioned in the schedule and I, therefore, need not repeat them. Since these departments are operating in different places with different policies, outlook, and approach and so on, you will agree with me, Madam Temporary Deputy Speaker, that this will be a continued waste of labour and resources and, perhaps, lack of effective service if it continues that way.Having grasped the fact that we are trying to bring into one hold these specialised institutions now administered separately under the Ministry but under the same umbrella, the House will agree with me that for the last three we have been concentrating on education institutions. As a result of that exercise, we have opened up universities with specialised faculties. This is not a part of a university but it will be a constituent college for the establishment and running of the faculties and institutions that I have mentioned.I think we should not tighten up certain losely knitted institutions which operate independently to come to their logical and relevant systemTHE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (CTD.)under the legal instrument so that they know where they are going, their legal basis and so on.Having mentioned the preliminary aspect of the Bill from policy point of view and since I do not want to repeat what the Minister has so ably explained, I feel I might just mention the set up of the Bill. It is unfortunate that we published this. Bill many months ago and hon. Members may have mislaid their copies or they have probably studied it and left it behind. Not with standing, that, I will Aurge the hon. Members to listen to some of the important sections and clauses contained in this Bill. I will begin with Clause 1 which is normally the title of the Bill. It will be brought into existence. When it has been passed by this August House on a day to be appointed by the Minister himself.THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (CTD.)Clause 2 contains the definition of certain words and phrases which recur repeatedly in the Bill and since these are not many, I might as well mention them individually. "Academic Board" means the academic board of the college established under section 11. "Alumni Association" is known in the academic field to mean an association of past and present under-graduates of a college or university who have powers to meet and discuss matters relevant to the institution and recommend solutions to the academic board or council. So, this is an important part of the institution which keeps in touch with past graduates and under-graduates. We have not had such as association in many of our universities laws, but they still have it in their own administrative arrangements. "Board of Management" will be instituted and "constituent training colleges" are the ones we have already mentioned. "Principal" and "Deputy Principal" are normal definitions. "Statues" means the statutes made by Board of Management under section 19.Madam Temporary/Deputy Speaker, Clause 3 is pertinent in that it establishes the college as a body corporate by the name of the Kenya Medical Training College which becomes the successor, so to speak, of the Government institution hitherto known as the College of Health Professions. The new body incorporates all the training centres that are specified in the Schedule to this Bill, and such other institutions as the Minister may, from time to time, deems necessary to be gazetted. We always leave room for growth and expansion so that without having to come back to the House, the Minister may have power to declare institutions a part of the Kenya medical Training College. Once established in this shape, a college acquires all the powers and responsibilities that accompany any corporate body and becomes a legal entity capable of being sued and suing in its own name. Such a body is also capable of entering into contracts of any sort without having to go back to the Ministry for that purpose.Clause 4 provides that the college has a seal. It is important to have this seal in order to authenticate the functions of the college. The seal will be kept in the custody of the Board of Management, which will direct how theTHE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (CTD.)seal should be used.Clause 5, Madam Temporary Deputy Speaker, states the functions of the college. These are supposed to be distinguished from those of other colleges. These functions include the provision of facilities for college education for national health manpower requirements, in addition to facilities provided by universities, other colleges and schools, and playing an effective role in the development and expansion of opportunities for Kenyans wishing to continue with their education in the disciplines approved by the academic board. There are those students who may graduate or leave other colleges and are inclined to studying some medical disciplines that this Bill will, provide. There are several other functions specified here and hon. Members may wish to have a look at them. If there is any suggestion for additional functions or deletion of some of the functions specified here, we will look at it.We value clause 6 because it prohibits discriminatory admission to the college on grounds of tribe, sex, and so on. It provides that this admission will be purely based on academic qualifications. It is a part of our Government policy that tribal inclinations be eliminated. There should be no discrimination on sex or creed grounds. So, admission will be open to all and applicants will be based on their own qualifications acceptable to the college. A principal will be appointed by the Minister on advice of the Board of Management, and the deputy principal will be appointed by the Board of Management after consultation with the academic board this is normal.Clause 9 establishes a Board of Management of not less than 15 persons drawn heavily from Government Ministries, especially the Ministry of Health. There will be members of the public to represent public interests. The criteria to be used when co-opting other members to the board have not been provided in this Bill, but it is expected that the Board of Management will exercise its discretion wisely in this regard.Clause 10 enumerates the functions of the Board of Management. These are listed here and I do not have to deal with each individually. Let me justTHE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (CTD.)mention one of them. The Board of Management shall have power to administer the property and funds of the college other than property and funds of a constituent training centre, in a manner and for purposes which will promote the best interests of the college, but the board shall not charge or dispose of immovable property of the college except in accordance with the procedures laid down by the State Corporations Advisory Committee established under the State Corporations Act.THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (CTD.)This is purely to legalise the existence and management of any property that is owned by the college or faculty. Clause 11 establishes the academic board of a college proper. There will be a principal who shall be the chairman, the deputy principal and the heads of the faculties of the college, the head of each constituent training centre, two members of the academic staff of the college and two students members elected by the student body of the college. However, as the Minister pointed out earlier, the enrolment of nurses shall continue to be done under the Nurses Act, Cap 257. I should emphasize that little distinction that gives some edge to the nurses to run their own institutions of training, examinations, regulations and enrolment. Should it become necessary in future, they will become full members and, no doubt, amendments will be brought to this House to cater for that.Clause 13 deals with the staff of the College while Clause 14 is on the performance of functions in absence of office bearers. This is purely necessary so that if the principal or someone else is not there, then the has the power to tie up to ensure the continued perfomance of the College.Part IV of the Bill deals with the Financial Provisions and Clauses 15, 16 and 17 deal with the financial year, which shall commence on 1st July and ending on the 30th June in the next succeeding year, the investment of funds and Annual estimates, respectively. Naturally this will coincide with the policy of fiscal accountability as is done in the Government and other established institutions. The annual estimates shall be made for all the estimated expenditure of the college, like for the salaries, pension, proper maintenance of buildings, repairs and replacement of equipment, funding of the cost of teaching and research activities and creation of such funds to meet future contingent liabilities. So, the financial arrangement has alreadyTHE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (CTD.)been included in the Bill so that the College will operate on a strong financial basis and without any difficulties. It must continue to provide those very specialised learning skills for the betterment of our people.Accounts and auditing are taken care of under clause 18 and we always repeat when we come here that public institutions should have their accounts audited. It becomes very useful if they can find time to actually gazette the results of the auditing and, of course, this auditing is done by the Auditor-General (Corporations). When these statements are made public, the college or any other institution always gets support from members of the public and other donors who are entitled to know how the funds of such an institution are spent. It is therefore important for the accounts to be published. If they are not made public, there is always suspicion that the funds have not been utilised for the purposes for which they were meant.Part V deals with Miscellaneous Provisions and under Clause 19, there is provision for statutes to cater for the establishment of faculties, description of diplomas, requirements for the awards and so on. The transitional provision and it is not the one I have is always provided under Section 22 that from the date of the gazettement of this Act, all legal liabilities, power and other matters that had been vested in the College of Health Profession, or other subsequent training, shall automatically be brought into sphere of this institution without further arrangement of transfers. This is an enabling section which gives automatic vesting of all existing rights, personalty or realty, obligations and liabilities as existing at the time of gazettement in those constituent training centres or the College of Health Professions.Madam Temporary Deputy Speaker, the Bill is very straight forward as it is the creation that will give evidence of our expansion of our activities and to the fact that the country is developing and it will recognise the growth of our population and the need for the services required by theTHE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (CTD.)population and, having done that, to bring them into one institution that will be able to cater for all. Being a new and elaborate public institution public funds will be needed and there will be additional expenditure of public funds amounting to K¬£25,000.With those few remarks, I beg to second. </NEWSPEECH>(Question proposed)<NEWSPEECH>MR. LEWA: Thank you very much, Madam Temporary Deputy Speaker, for giving me a chance to contribute on the Bill before us on the formation of the Kenya Medical Training College. Right from the outset, I would like to congratulate the Minister for bringing the Bill before us to the House because it ends a period of anxiety where for the last six years or so the former Medical Training Centre has been referred to as the College of Health Professions and the people in the University of Nairobi were not amused by that name. This is because, as we already know, there was this faculty which, of course, was the College of Health Sciences. So, it was a question of the chiefs and the big chiefs and we did not know who was supposed to be training who.Be that as it may, having this Bill before the House shows how the Government has been concerned with the training of the lower cadres in the medical profession. As we know, since 1987 this exercise has been going on and it is not many countries in Africa that have had this track record.MR. LEWA (CTD.)What has always been worrying me is the fact that in our efforts to make sure that manpower is available we tend to go a little bit higher. We have done away with the former auxilliary staff that were there by way of‚Äì‚Äì‚ÄìIn the 1940s and early 1950s, if you take an example of the pharmacy profession, you had the dispensers and compounders who were very efficient and the training took barely one year. People were taken on as, maybe, subordinate staff but later on were given special training and, through experience, they became very useful.Madam Temporary Deputy Speaker, what I am trying to get at is the fact that now that we train people of the middle cadre such as doctors, dentists, pharmacists and others, with the training taking three years after Form IV even with the current 8-4-4 education system, and one wonders why such a college could not seriously think of introducing some courses for auxilliary staff when will last for about a year. It would not matter because it could be done at the grassroot level. I am saying this because we know that the Ministry of Health has been putting a lot of effort in selling the idea of primary health care and health for all by the year 2000. My understanding of primary health care is that at the village level people must have access to somebody who has some idea about what it means to keep your body clean, what it means to have a mouth that has been brushed properly and what it means to boil that water that has not come from a tap. If, at the village level, you has somebody who could educate wananchi, then this exercise would be more successful.Madam Temporary Deputy Speaker, I know that there is no organised programme for the traditional birth attendants. We know, for sure, that there are a lot of babies who are still born in the rural areas and, as far as I know, there is no programme of training and equipping these traditional birth attendants with certificates. It would, therefore, be very important if the Kenya Medical Training College that we are discussing now could look into ways and means of ensuring that auxilliary staff at that level are taught the merits of good health so thatMR. LEWA (CTD.)they can also assist the Ministry of Health in providing primary health care at all levels.At the other end of the structure, Madam Temporary Deputy Speaker, there has been a sort of wall against those people who graduated from the former college of health professionals. Their ability to pursue further studies has not been quite defined. We have very bright chaps who have done clinical medicine, very bright chaps who have achieved diplomas and certificates as pharmacy technicians and very bright chaps who have done their certificates in oral hygiene, but they have no opportunity to go further and obtain degrees in medicine in this country. I suppose, maybe, it is because, as we were told the Minister for Health, the Ministry of Health was not quite responsible for this because the college was not under its umbrella. We are now talking about an academic board which is to be established under this Bill, and one would hope that this closed‚Äîdoor element will no longer be there. We know, for sure, not everybody under the 8-4-4 education system will be able to attain the grade to go straight to university to do medicine, pharmacy and other related derees. But that young man who excels should be given that opportunity to go further because people mature at different times depending on the prevailing circumstances at a given time.That, madam, Temporary Deputy Speaker, takes me back to the Question. I asked here last week as to the availability of surgeons in Kenya, particularly in Kilifi District. Of course, we were told that there are no enough surgeons to go round. Mr. Recollection is that before you become a surgeon you have to do medicine and then the rest is theory. Practice makes you a very good surgeon. Therefore, one wonders why, after having the former medical training centre, the college of health professionals and now the Kenya Medical Training College, we cannot have a progamme that will ensure that we have enough surgeons by recruiting into university those clinical officers, who have been exposed to the surgical procedures over the years. I do not want to sound a little bit naive, but it is a fact that through experience you do not necessary have to be called MR. LEWA (CTD.)a sugeon to perform some surgical procedures like hernia and the rest. It is, therefore, my recommendation that the Kenya Medical Training College, in liaison with the College of Health Sciences of the University of Nairobi and the other faculty of medicine that will be established at Moi University, will have an opportunity to sit on this board of management. I hope that the two will be able to liaise and come out with a programme that will ensure that those who are able to go further will do so and ensure that we have enough manpower in those areas that need practice and speciality after many years.Madam Temporary Deputy Speaker, I note also that item (j) of the Clause constituting the board of management talks of not more than three persons who will be co-opted by the board of management from time to time, not being public officers or employees of the college, to represent public interest. Fine. But how about the professional societies that exist in the country?MR. LEWA (CTD.)Madam Temporary Deputy Speaker, one would have thought that they would have been given an opportunity I know they are many; they are about 26 or so. These include the Kenya Medical Association, Pharmaceautical Association of Kenya, Kenya Dentists Association and many others. One wonders why they have not been given an opportunity to be members of this Board of Management.(The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mrs. Ndetei) left the Chair)(The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Malebe) took the Chair)Getting back to the training aspect of it, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, since 1927, they have done very well. But we still, have that hung-up of relying too much on the existence of big machinery, large buildings and so on. One wonders whether the Ministry can at some stage give this House the effect of the introduction of hospital maintenance schools that were established about four years ago. I am saying so because we have these four hospital maintenance schools and as far as I know, graduates have been coming out of these schools for the last two years. But if you visit some hospitals you will find that the number of microscopes, V.P. machines, small sterilizers, and other small gadgets still lie all over the place unattended to. People really do not give a hoot. It is a shame that we have so many machines wasting away when we pride ourselves in having four hospital maintenance schools in the country. These schools are built in strategic areas in the country.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have no quarrel with the idea of separating the procedures applying to nurses as far as registration and curricular development and so on is concerned. However, my bone of contention is that at the administration level up there, you have the Chief Nursing Officer, the Deputy Nursing officers those people up there in the Ministry of Health. One wonders why the should be in higher grades and naturally earn more money, therefore, than the Chief Pharmacist in the Republic of Kenya and the Chief Dentist in the Republic of Kenya. I think this is not fair and the matter should be looked into and regularised.Finally, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as we discuss the Kenya Medical Training College Bill, members of staff will obviously a move out from the Ministry of Health. My understanding is that they will not be civil servants per se. We hope that a situation will not arise whereby people who are supposed to be in this College stay back in the Ministry of Health for fear of losing terminal benefits and so on and thereby we end up with lack of manpower by way of training personnel at the Kenya Medical Training College. I say so because it is only recently that we were told that the Kenya national Hospital, upon becoming a parastatal started suffering from a shortage of doctors and nurses. I am not an expert; I have no answer yet but I am told that one of the reasons for this is that people opted to remain in the Ministry of Health for job security reasons. Here I am talking about pensions and other benefits, There were not sure what tomorrow would be like.With those few comments I beg to support. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>Mr.KIRWA: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute on this Bill, First of all I would like to thank the Minister for Health for moving this very important Bill. This is a good Bill because for the effective management of many of these organizations we need to have some kind of entity such that the organizations are able to make most of the decisions on their own thereby avoiding red tape and bureacracy. The should be able to make effective and fast decisions.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we know that there is a human element in these organizations and the running point in many of the issues that are raised in this country is about tribalism, The issue of tribalism is so sensitive that tickles ana nerves of every individual in this nation. I say so because as much as we would like to--- We like to condemn others for being tribalists when we do not at the same time look at ourselves to see how traibalistic or nationalistic we are What I am driving at is that when it comes to training, and I stand to be corrected by the Minister or the institutions concerned, if a principal is from a particular tribe there is a high tendency that students who are going to be admitted into, that institution are going to be members of his tribe. Sometimes the students are recruited from his own village. We must stand as one nation and avoid temptations. "We should not give a chance to our detractors to attack. The principals of the various colleges ought to avoid this kind of thing.The other issue is about the discipline of students. Six months ago, in the College at Eldoret, some students were disciplined and those students were disciplined not because they had made a mistake but because they happened to come from a community other than the community the Principal of thatMr.KIRWA (CTD.)institution comes from. If we have to be united we must avoid these things.The same thing applies to recruitment. If the Principal of an institution has "been given an opportunity to recruit people he will be tempted to recruit from his tribe only. We have different activities for different communities in Kenya. For the Kalenjins they like looking after animals. It can be anomalous if the principal of a college in an area which is occupied or settled by the Kalenjins brings people from his own area to after animals that belong to that institution when there are so many Kalenjins who can look after those animals well. I am not saying this with reference to this particular institution we are going to incorporate in the Bill but I am saying is it as a general policy throughout the country. We should not be tribalistic.The same applies to the promotion of members of staff. You will find that members of staff may have different credentials or similar gradings at a particular. After working in an institution for a period of time they ought to be promoted. We say that the Public Service Commission is going to handle these promotions but you will find that when it comes to these interviews there is some under-hand activities by somepeople to ensure that those who are promoted come from their home areas; I do not know why this happens. The only thing I can infer is that somebody wants to be secure in his position so that if any malpractices are going to be committed in that institutions he is going to be covered by people from his home area.The same goes for opportunities for further training. When training opportunities arises‚Äî If for instance there are three chances the Principal of the college will ensure that the first two chances will go to persons who come from his home area and if heMr.KIRWA (CTD.)is generous the third chance will go to a lucky group that may be a sympathiser of his.Mr.KIRWA (CTD.)But in most cases he will go ahead and give the three scholarships to people from his community. These are some of the things that we, as a nation, need to look into and fight as much as we can.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, while we would like such an institutions to be able to manage its finances to borrow and lend to whoever it feels is okay, we have to be very cautious. This is because some our institutions in the past have been lending money to dubious institutions so that a few years the borrowing institutions collapse with a lot of pulbic funds. Some of the lending is done under dubious circumstances. At times it is done into personal accounts so that after a period the interest accrued goes into the pocket of an individual. The crux of the matter is that we have formed these institutions to assist run our country better and give services in a better way than before; we are not forming these institutions to enrich a few individuals. If that was the motive, then could give them soft loans and tell them to do business elsewhere.One thing that we should deal is: If I am a principal of an institutions', should I do business with that insitution? Am I going to supply potatoes or linen to that particular institution? We ought to scrutinise these things because as a nation we cannot stand unless we manage the finances we have properly. Today, many of the people running institutions do enormous business with, those institutions with the result that roost of the time is spent in looking after their business interests instead of locking after the interests of those institutions.It is also important that the parent Ministry ensures proper management of finances, We should not give money to institutions and leave them alone. If an institutions is not doingMr.KIRWA (CTD.)well we ought to investigate and know whether the fault is with the heads of the institution or with sons machinery within the particular institution. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for an institution to be viable and vibration in our society it ought to undertake serious research. we should encourage personnel in these institutions to do research by ensuring that money set aside for research work is not diverted to recurrent, or other types of, expenditure. We know mergencies occur, but these emergencies should be catered for from other funds and leave the money for research to be used in that work and opportunities for further studies.With regard to hospital maintenance, four institutions have already been set up. But we need to do a continuous evaluation to see whether the graduates from these institutions will be useful in the field. We should investigate to see whether the number in the field now is not enough to do the job. The training period and the kind of training undertaken in these particular institutions should be assessed. It would be better to strengthen the unit so that most of the hospital equipment is maintained by internal staff.Looking at the constituent centres of the Medical Training College, I am sorry to say that their distribution throughout the country is not fair. This is/some districts already have constituent training centres while some provinces may have one or none at all. So, I urge that, while the Ministry may not have money now, in future as it sets up more constituent training centres, it should consider sitting them in various parts of the country. Apart from giving training, these institutions give service to wananchi. Already we have one at Eldoret and would be better now if another one is set upMr.KIRWA (CTD.)another one in Turkana, or in any other district that is far from Eldoret, so that the institutions are spread all over the country and used in giving services to our people.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other thing is that our trained staff in medical, or teaching, profession seem to lack public relations. I say this because, while I sympathise with our hospital personnel for the big load they have to handle, the patients in our hospital are subjected to poor reception. I urge the Ministry to impart a lot of public relations component into our medical trainees. It makes a lot difference if a patient receives good reception at a hospital. Health workers must remember that their handling of patients reflects on the image of the Government either positively or negatively for the patients do not look at health workers as individuals but as part and parcel of the Government.Another issue, which is also of importance to our people, regards of the registration of pharmacists. we know there is a board that decides who will be registered. It is important for the Ministry to ensure that this board meets regularly - sometimes it takes too long before it meets so that many of the people who are ready to serve our people can be registered and get the opportunity to serve. So, the Ministry should, under its overall policy, should lock into the possibilities of trying to strenthen some of the units I have touched onWith those remarks, I beg to support. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. TERER: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity this important Bill. It is a straight forward Bill and so I will not take much time in making my observations. I think the Ministry should plan to establish a medical training in every province when resources become available.MR. TERER (CTD.)Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to suggest that every district should have a training will because we require trained personnel to mann our health centres and dispensaries which are quite many.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, with regards to some mysterious diseases which are coming up now and then, I think the Ministry should have a mobile team of experts which would be visiting certain areas like West Fokot where it was reported that there is a mysterious disease which has not been diagnosed. With regards to the establishment of health centres and dispensaries, I think the Ministry should step in and assist wananchi regarding the putting up these health centres and dispensaries. They should also offer wanachi the proper advice regarding the requirements and facilities that ought to be provided in these health institutions. They should step in and assist in providing these specifications so that wananchi do not put up premises that are not suitable as health centres or dispensaries.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Ministry should have a comprehensive plan of tailing over all these Earanbee health centres and dispensaries. It should be the policy of the Ministry to take over these institutions as times go on and as funds become available. Sometimes, there are complicated illnesses which cannot be treated within the countries and there have been certain cases which have been recommended for treatment abroad, This is a very expensive type of treatment and I think the Ministry should set aside funds to subsidize overseas treatment because we may not have all the necessary facilities and expertise to deal with these very complicated cases. I think the time has now come for us to train more health educators because as we all know, prevention is better than cure. So, we should have a good number of health educators especially in the rural areas to promote health and, of course, to prevent diseases.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is also important to have enough health educators in all our health institutions. Now, coming to the area of management, I think there is a provision in this Bill which saysMR. TERER (CTD.)that there shall he not more than three persons coopted by the Board of Management from time to time. It is my view that all the seven provinces should be represented on the Board. I also think that the Minister should be given the powers to appoint seven people from the provinces. I would support the previous speaker since I think the time has now come when our medical staff should be trained in public relations so that they can learn how to handle the sick and the public at large. There have been some isolated cases where the medical staff have been very rude to patients. In certain areas where the staff may not be able to speak the local language, it would be advisable to have an interpreter so that those who cannot speak the national language can communicate easily with the medical staff so that their problems can be diagnosed.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, when it comes to the area of training of medical staff, this should be evenly distributed all over the country I am saying this because the tendency in the east has been to recruit people from the headquarters. I think every district should be given a quota for training so that it can recruit its own people. It is hope that as our general public become literate, there will not be this question of posting medical staff in their own areas. However, where there are cases of patients not being able to communicate with the national language, an interpreter has to be provided so that these patients can have their problems properly diagnosed by the doctor.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, coming to the area of drugs, I think something ought to be done really because most of our hospitals and health centres are very much short of drugs. Although we have now adopted the policy-of cost sharing, wananchi are sometimes forced to buy	drugs from private chemists and since these drugs are very expensive, they end up by not having treatment because they cannot afford buying the drugs. I think there is a way of determining whether somebody is able to afford the drugs or not so that the Ministry can bear the cost. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as far as the distribution of health facilities are concerned, I think the Ministry should be able to determine areas where health centresMR. TERER (CTD.)and hospitals should be put up. They should in doing so consider areas which are densily populated and the distances from one health facilitate another.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, having said that, I would now like, to appeal to the Ministry to subside Missionary Hospitals in the country. I think the missionaries in this country are doing a very good job and therefore, they should be commended and complimented in terms of giving them funds. For a long time we have been relying quite a lot on these people and I think the time has now come for the Ministry to consider giving them special consideration.With those few remarks, I beg to support. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES (Mr. Lomada): Ahsanta sana Kaibu Spika wa kuda kwa kunipatia rafasi hii ili nizungume juu ya Kswada huu wa Kenya Medical Training College. Kingetaka kumpongeza Naziri kwa kufikiria juu ya jambo hili ili kuwesa kuongeza idadi ya xanz waugusi, wakunga na madaktari ambao wanawatibu watu wetu katika mambo ya matibabu. Ningeta kusema kwamba vyao tunavyo kwa wakati huu vya kuwafundisha wakunga na wauguzi, ni vichache sara. Kwa hivyo, ni lazina Nizara hii ifikirie jinsi ya kuviongeza. vile vile, kuna umuhimu wa kuongeza vifaa vinavyotumiwa katika vituo vya afya na zahanati.THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES (CTD.)Bw. Naibu Spika wa Kuda, ingefaa vifaa hivi viwe vya maana na ambavyo vinaweza kuwasaidia wafanya kazi kwa urahisi. wakati Hizara hii inanunua vifaa hivi, ions kwamba ni vyak kudumu na vinaweza kutumiwa kwa urahisi. Tunapozungumza juu yz Mswada huu, ningependa kumvambia Waziri kwamba ujenzi wa Hospitali ya wilaya ya kapenguria sasz umekami1ika na tunz medical training school ambayo ilijengwa kitambo na bado haijaansa kufanya kazi. Sasa ni miaka mitano au sita imepita tangu shule ianzishwe na hali haijaanza kutoa huduma wo wote. Ingefaa wakati Waziri anapofikiria juu ya medical school, pia aifikirie hii shule ambayo iko katika Wilaya ya West Pokot. Shule hii ina majengo ya kutosha na kile kinatakikana niapesa Kidogo za kuiwesesha kuanza kutoa huduma kwa wananchi. Shule hii ikianza kufanya kasi, basi itawahudumia vijana wengi kutoka pembe zote nchini na hasa kutoka pokot na Lodwar ili nao wawe sawa na watu wengine. Shule hizi zinatakikana ili ziwatumikie wananchi haraka iwezekanavyo.Ingefaa kila wilaya iwe na medical school moja ili ziwahudumie wananchi wa schemu hizo. Kwa mfano, Turkana ni wilaya kubwa sana na ingefaa iwe na medical training school moja na kwingineko ambako shule haziko. Nafikiri Waziri atafikiria sana juu ya usambazaji wa shule h_izi kote nchini.Ningependa kusema machache juu wamisheni ambao.wanafanya kasi ya maana na ingefaa tuwapongeze ipasavyo. Hii ni kwa sababu wale ambao wamepata masomo katika medical training schools zao, wamewasaidia wananchi sana kwa njia mbali mbali. Ingefaa shule hizi hata kama ziko chini ya wamisheni ziangaliwe na kama zina shida za kifedha zisaidiwe. kwa mfano, tuna hospitali moja kule West Pokot inayoitwa Ortum Mission Hospital ambayo ina shule inayo wafundisha wasichana kazi ya ukunga. Shule hii imefanya kazi nzuri sana na sasa wasichana wengi wamehitimu na wanawatumikiz watu wetu katika sehemu mbali mbzli nchini. Ningependa kumuuliza Waziri aifikirie shule hii kwa njia ya kifedha iliwawezc kuendeleza kazi yao. Tukifanya hivi, basi tutakuwa tumewasaidia wananchi kwa ifaavyo.Kwa hayo machache, naunga Nswada huu mkono. </NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATI0N (Mr. Munyi): Thank you. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to comment on this very important Bill. First of all, I would like to congratulate the Minister for bringing this Bill which has come at the right time. This is in accordance with the District Focus for Rural Development.As the Assistant Minister for Culture and Social Services, Mr. Lomada. has said, we had a chance of travelling to West Pokot and you were there, Sir, and we visited the Ortum Mission Hospital and we saw the training school within that hospital. I know that donations for putting up that hospital came from Holland and Netherlands. That training college in Kapenguria should be assisted either by the Government or other countries through donations.when we went to Lodwar, I saw a nursing school there.THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATI0N (CTD.)I think the only thing that is now being awaited is the staff to start working. That college in Turkana can be very useful to the whole of the area from Lake Turkana downwards. Girls and boys from Turkana Girls Secondary School and Turkana Boys Secondary School will be trained in that college.I would now like to come to Embu. I would like to thank the Minister very much because he started a college in Embu to train nurses. In addition, I would like to tell the Minister that a Toyota vehicle was given to Kieni Hospital adn Nurses Training School by the Ministry of Health. That vehicle has been there for the last 10 years, but it has now been bonded. I appeal to the Minister, now that he has received some vehicles from Japan and the United Nations Children's Education Fund, to give one of these vehicles to the Nurses Training College in Kieni because the one that has been there is already worn out and has been bonded.This college has started a project of community nursing training school, and we would like more funds to be given to it so that a good college may be constructed there is happening at Kieni Girls Secondary School. I remember that recently, when the Bishop of Embu Diocese went to Italy and Germany, he tried to look for some donors to finance the construction of that college and I am sure that if the Minister intervenes, he will find many donors willing to assist in putting up modern buildings in the hospital. We have some Kenyan doctors in the hospital, but we also have some expatriate ones, too, from the Netherlands who are doing a very good job. we would like them to continue to render their services there. When their contract expires, it should be extended. At present, we have a local doctor there.There is also a missionary centre in Kieni Complex. There is also Kieni Girls Secondary School, which is one of the best girls secondary schools in Kenya judging from O‚ÄîLevel examination results. Last time, almost 100.girls went to university from that school. The environment of the area is good; When you move from that area, you go to Runyenjes Sub‚ÄîDistrict Hospital, whereTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATI0N (CTD.)some nurses have been going to serve people. These nurses have also been serving in other areas where we do not facilities. I appeal to the Minister to note that the grant that the Ministry of Health has been giving is very small. Health services are very important and this grant, which is given by the Ministry through the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance should be increased.The Ministry of Health should also be in a position to give more funds to mission hospitals and training colleges, such as the one in West Pokot. I know that there are such colleges not only in embu, but also in Mathari Hospital, Nyeri. Kvale, Kajiado, and so on. We should give all these colleges funds so as to modernise them. When we do this, this will be a part of the District Focus for Rural Development.I do not want to say much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, except to support the Bill. Thank you. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. WASIKE‚ÄîNDOMBI: Asante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, kwa kunipa nafasi ili nami niyaseme maneno mawili au matatu. Kwanza, ningetaka kumshukuru Waziri kwa kuleta Mswada huu hapa wakati huu kwa sababu hili ni jambo la maana sana. Pili, ningependa kuchukua nafasi hii kumshukuru Waziri na Serikali yetu kwa jumla kwa kuondoa cost-sharing ambayo ilikuwa imeleta shida kubwa sana kiasi kwamba watu wengi walikuwa wakifa kwa kukosa Sh.10, Shs.20 au Sh.50 za kuwawezesha kwenda hospitali.Kuna kifungu fulani cha Mswada huu kinachosema kwamba wanachama fulani wa bodi watakuwa wakiteuliwa na Mtukufu Rais ambao watapaswa kutuma barua za kustaafu kwa principal. Labda Waziri atalifafanua jambo hili kidogo. Ikiwa watu hawa wataxuwa wakiteuliwa na Mtukufu Rais, watakuwa wateule wa Rais na ninafikiri kwamba ingefaa wakitaka kustaafu wawe wakipeleka barua zao kwa Rias, huku watu wengine wakipeleka barua zao kwa principal.Ningependekeza kwamba uchaguzi wa wanafunzi uangaliwe. Hivi sasa, kuna mvumo mpya wa elimu wa 8-4-4 ambao umeenea kote katika Kenya. Kwa hivyo,MR. WASIKE‚ÄîNDOMBI (CTD.)ingefaa kuwe na uchaguzi aina ya quota system ili wanafunzi wengi wanaochaguliwa wawe ni wale wanaotoka katika sehemu inayohusika. Ninasemivi hivi kwa sababu mvumo mpya wa elimu umeenea kila mahali na hapana sehemu yo yote ambapo hapana wanafunzi ambao wamesoma vya kutosha. Principal wa chuo hiki asiwe mtu mwenye kupenda kujificha. Nairobi ndipo mahali pazuri sana pa kujificha. Mtu huyu anaweza kujificha hapa Nairobi na kuwachukua wanafunzi kutoka sehemu yake tu.MR. WASIKE‚ÄîNDOMBI (CTD.)Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, tunasema ukweli kwa sababu ukweli ndio uliopo. Utaona kwamba principal wa chuo fulani anawajaza watu kutoka sehemu anakotoka halafu anadanganyana kwamba uchaguzi huo unafanyiwa hapa Nairobi.Jambo lingine ningependa kusema ni kwamba imekuwa vigumu sana wanafunzi wakifuzu masomo yao kwenye vyuo vyetu kupata kazi. Inawabidi kuzunguka mijini kwa muda mrefu sana kabla ya kupata kazi mahali popote. Nikisema hivyo simaanishi kuwa watu wanasoma ili kupata mishahara, lakini katika maendeleo yetu sasa, ninaona kwamba wengi wa vijana tunaowapeleka kwenye vyuo vyetu, na hata katika hiki tunachozungumzia hapa, hawapati nafasi zozote za kazi wanapofuzu. Ingefaa tufanye mipango ifaavyo ili tusiwe tunapoteza manpower.Hapo mbeleni Serikali imekuwa na mtindo wa kwenda katika kila shule na kuona ni wanafunzi gani wanaoweza kuingia katika vyuo fulani ili kusomea ufundi tofauti tofauti. Hivyo hivyo, ingefaa Wizara na hata pia makampuni ya kibinafsi kuwa na maofisa watakaokuwa wakienda kwenye vyuo vikuu ili kuhakikisha kuwa wanawachukua wale wanaofaa kuajiriwa katika kazi mbali mbali. Kwa njia hii vijana wetu watajua wanaelekea wapi. Inakuwa ni jambo la aibu sana kijana kufuzu masomo yake, na hata Serikali yenyewe imetumia pesa zake nyingi kwenye masomo hayo, kuona kuwa kijana huyo hawezi kupata kazi yoyote. Je, ikiwa kijana kama huyo na amesomeshwa na kiwango kikubwa sana cha pesa hatapata kazi, atazitoa wapi pesa hizo za kuyalipa madeni yaliyogharamia masomo yake?Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, najua kuwa mafunzo haya ya matibabu yana kazi nyingi sana na wanaohitimu wana kazi nyingi za kufanya. Ningependa kumwomba Waziri ahakikishe kuwa vijana wanaosomea kwenye vyuo hivi ma matibabu wawe wakiajiriwa wakifuzu masomo yao. Nina mifano ya kule ninako-wakilisha ambako clinical officer wa Navakholo Health Centre alistaafu mnamo 1989, Disemba. Imechukua muda mpaka mwezi uliopita kupatiwa ofisa mwingine wa matibabu. Lakini yule ofisa ambaye ameonyesha ujuzi mkubwa sana katika MR. WASIKE‚ÄîNDOMBI (CTD.)kazi yake atakuwa akiondoka Jumanne ijayo. Amehamishwa kwenda Kajiado na kutoka huko anaenda kusoma zaidi. Ninatoa shukrani kwa Serikali kwa sababu ni lazima watu wetu waendelee kupata masomo zaidi, lakini isiwe kwamba ofisa kama huyo akiondoka inachukua muda mrefu hivyo kabla ya kumpata mwingine. Nasema hivyo kwa sababu huyo ofisa anayeondoka alikuwa ameupunguza sana ugonjwa unaojulikana kama Highland Malaria na pia Menengitis. Ninamwomba Waziri ahakikishe kuwa tumepatiwa ofisa mwingine huko Navakholo Health Centre mara tu aliye huko atakapoondoka, na vile vile iwe ikihakikishwa kila mahali ambapo pana shida kama hiyo kuwa kunapatikana ofisa wa kutoa huduma hizo mara moja.Ningependa pia kutoa shukrani kwa Bw. Waziri kwa kuwa vile visa vya dawa kupotea katika Wizara vimepunguka sana. Ningependa kumhimiza asiulegese huo mwendo wake. Kuna madaktari wengine ambao wako hospitalini na pia wana kliniki zao huko kando na karibu na kliniki zao kuna pharmacy za kuuza dawa. Sasa, dawa nyingi zinazopelekwa hospitalini zinatolewa kupitia kwa milango ya nyuma na kuingizwa kwenye pharmacy hizo. Ningependa Waziri alichunguze sana ili dawa hizi za kupelekwa hospitalini zisiwe bado zinapotea na kupelekwa kwenye pharmacy.Pia, ningependa kuongea kuhusu sindano zinazotumiwa kuwadunga watu hospitalini. Kwa wakati huu ambapo tuna huu ugonjwa unaojulikana kama Ukimwi, ingefaa iwe kwamba sindano inayotumika ni ile tu inayojulikana kama disposable need.le. Sasa utaona katika hospitali nyingine madaktari wakizichukua zile sindano na kuzipeleka katika kliniki zao, na zile ambazo zinatumika baada ya kuchemshwa wanaziacha hospitalini. Ningependa Waziri alichunguze jambo hili kwa sababu likiachwa kuendelea litakuwa likifanya ugonjwa huo mbaya uendelee kuenezwa, wakati tunafahamu vema kuwa Serikali yetu inajaribu kuukomesha.Inyawa ni vigumu kusimamia hospitali nyingine kuhusu malipo, Waziri anapaswa pia kuliingilia jambo hili. Si vizuri kuacha tu hospitali fulani kuwaMR. WASIKE‚ÄîNDOMBI (CTD.)zikitoza malipo ya matibabu ovyo. Kwa wakati huu ikiwa wewe ni mgonjwa, ama umepata ajali na unahitaji upasuaji, unatakikana kuwa na Ksh.10, 000/- kama deposit, kabla hujapasuliwa. Nina hakika Waziri ana habari hizi, Je, ni wangapi nchini Kenya tunaweza kuwa tumejiwekea Ksh.10, 000/- wakati wowote, ili kuweza kukabiliana na malipo kama hayo? Ningependa Waziri alichunguze jambo hili kwa makini na hospitali hizi ziwe zikija.li uzima wa mtu kwanza, na si kufikiria pesa kwanza.Hapo hapo ningependa kusema kuhusu vyumba vya kuhifadhia maiti.Mahali hapo pamekuwa mahali pa biashara. Maofisa wanaohusika huko wanafanya biashara kutokana na mauti ya kifo. Unapopeleka maiti kwenye chumba cha kuhi fadhi maiti, unatakikana utoe pesa kidogo ili wauhifadhi mwili huo vizuri, la si hivyo utakuta baadaye wameutoa mwili huo kwenye sehemu inayofaa na kuuweka ovyo ovyo. Ingefaa Waziri alikomeshe jambo hili la biashara kutokana na mauti ya kifo.Nikisema hivyo, nafikiri pia ningemtaja Waziri wa Habari na Utanga-zaji. Kwa sasa Kenya Broadcasting Corporation inafanya biashara ya matangazo ya kifo kwa kulipisha kiasi cha Ksh.600/-. Sasa tunaelekea wapi? Ni vizuri kweli kufanya biashara kutokana na mauti?Kuna pia jambo la mavazi rasmi hospitalini. Utakuta kwamba hata wale wanaosoma wanapatiwa rinda moja kwa mwaka na anabidiika kuwa akivaa nguo zake anapoenaa kuyasafisha mavazi rasmi.MR. WASIKE‚ÄîNDOMBI (CTD.)Wanapoenda kufua nguo zao rasmi inakuwa ni lazima wavalie nguo za binafsi. Ningependa Waziri rawenyewe alichunguze hili jambo kwa maana wale wanaotoa tenda za kushona nguo rasmi wanachukua nafasi hii kuhakikisha kwamba wao wenyewe, mabibi zao na watoto wamepata masuti kabla ya kupeana tehda. Huo nido mtindo unaoendelea sasa.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, Waziri wa Afya tuliye naye ni va heshima sanana ana maofisa wazuri sana chini yake na anaweza kulichunguza jambo hili kwa makini sana.Huu ni Mswada wa maana sana na tungependelea kwamba majengo yaliyoko katika mahospitali na vituo vya mafunzo ya afya katika wilaya yawe yakirekebishwa ili yasiwe yakivuja mvua inaponyesha, hivyo kutatiza mafunzo ya wanafunzi. Most of these buildings have serious leakages, na ningependelea Bw. Waziri aliangaliejambo hili kwa makini ili wanafunzi wetu wasitaabike wanaposoma.Kwa hayo machache, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, naomba kuunga mkono. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Mr. Maiyani): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for affording me this opportunity to support this most important Bill.Sir, I wish to start by congratulating the Minister for Health for the good work he is doing in this Ministry. I would like to inform the Minister that Mukuruweini Nyayo Wards are nearly completed. There were two parts that were to be done by wananchi. First, the building containing the proper Nyayo Wards consisting of 144 beds is ready. Also, the wananchi took it upon themselves to build the kitchen and laundry and they have completed that part. It is such a wonderful building which does net compare with existing Nyayo Waives, kitciien and laundry in the country.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the people of Mukuruweini are very grateful because the Ministry also decided to build a pharmacy, X-ray room, theatre mortuary and other various buildings for doctors and, nurses among others.THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Mr. Maiyani) (CTD.)Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, they have also installed a very reliable water tank which cost a lot of money. The people of Mukuruweini are a really grateful to the Ministry. But we need equipment for the kitchen and other facilities at the hospital to make them function. The Government set aside over KShs.33 million for this project. But the money is being released in such small amounts that the contractor on site is very frustrated. I would like to request the Minister to take this matter seriously.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have started using one of the Nyayo Wards. But we are using that wing in a manner that is not very proper. This is because we are using very old beds and so on. The kitchen we are currently using is very old. We have a very modern kitchen but we cannot use it because it is not yet equipped. I would appreciate if the Minister for Health could liaise with the Treasury to ensure that we get the money that has been allocated to this hospital quickly so that we can officially open the hospital.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would also like to inform the Minister that we have a problem of transporting patients from Mukurweini to Nyeri and other neighbouring hospitals which have better facilities. We need a reliable ambulance for this particular hospital. Recently we had a very nasty experience at the hospital when an expectant mother art arrived at the hospital She was expecting twins and the staff at the hospital could do nothing to assist her. There was no ambulance but fortunately a private vehicle was found to rush the lady to Nyeri Hospital. This type of thing crops up from time to time. I am sure the Minister knows this area very well because we are neighbours. The area has a large population and therefore we need all the help we can get.THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Mr. Maiyani) (CTD.)Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, much as I would like to talk on this Bill I do realise that time is not on my side and therefore with these few words, I beg to support the Bill. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Okwara): Could we extend the time by 10 minutes so that we adjourn at 6.40 p.m.? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Malebe): No, we cannot do that.

MATE asked the Minister for Livestock Development why the sale of cattle in Ishiara Market has been suspended for the last nine months and when it will resume.<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Chesire):Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Cattle business was suspended at Ishiara Market because of an outbreak of contagious bovine pluro‚Äîpneumonia (C.B.P.P.) in Karaba and Nyuorore (?) Locations of Embu District. Consequently, the two locations were placed under C.B.P.P. quarantine. Business will resume at the market as soon as the Ministry establishes that the area is free from the disease. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MATE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as is indicated in my Question, this quarantine has taken almost one year now, and the people in Gachoka and Siakago Divisions suffered a lot when these markets were closed. Could the Assistant Minister command his people to make alternative arrangements in respect of where cattle sale can be carried on and provide the necessary mode of transportation? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. CHESIRE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not understand the mode of transportation that the hon. Member is referring to Could he more specific on what he means so that I may give him a proper answer? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MATE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, what I mean is that the Ministry's officers should allow the sale of livestock to continue in specified markets and the animals are put in a truck to be transported to various markets for slaughter. When these markets are closed, my people of Gachoka and Siakago Divisions suffer and their children cannot even go to school. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. CHESIRE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, C.B.P.P. is still prevalent in the area. Therefore, if we allow animals there to be moved from one area to another, this might spread the disease further afield. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MATE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the animals sold in these markets are mainly for slaughter, but not for keeping. If they are transported from Karaba or Ishiara, they are slaughtered in various places. So, this diseases cannot beMR. MATE (CTD.)to other areas. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. CHESIRE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, C.B.P.P. is contagious and it would be very risky to allow animals to be transported from one place to another because there is no guarantee that all the animals so transported will be slaughtered. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MATE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the last year examination was carried out by the Veterinary about six months ago. When do they think they are going to carry out the next examination and then open the sale? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. CHESIRE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the screening of the cattle this disease is being carried out in certain which were performed at areas from time to time. In fact, tests specific intervals have shown results as follows:-In November, 1989; 97 animals out 4,145 were found to be positive; in March, this year, nine animals were still positive, in July, this year, 15 out of 2 ,600 animals were found positive. Mr. Speaker, Sir, further screening is to be carried out on the 12th of this month and if all the animals are found to be negative then the Ministry will review the situation at that time. But, not before all the animals are found to be negative. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Next Question, Mr. Lotim. </NEWSPEECH>Question No. 579<HEADER>Kenya National Trading Company Staff at Kapenguria</HEADER>MR. LOTIM asked the Minister for Commerce:-(a) how many people have been employed by Kenya National Trading Company, Kapenguria Branch, since its establishment; and(b) what are their designations and duties. </NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR COMMERCE (Mr. Kombo): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(a) people are employed by the Kenya National Trading Company, Kapenguria branch.THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR COMMERCE (Mr. Kombo) (CTD.)(b) Those employed include depot manager, cashier store-keeper, two assistant store-keepers, labourer and The depot manager is responsible for the general administration of the Kapenguria depot. The cashier is responsible for cash receipts and payments. The store-keepers receive goods and issue inter-depot transfers receipts for stock. The labourers look into the cleanliness of the office and the compound while the watchmen are charged with the maintenance of security. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. LOTIM: Mr. Speaker, Sir, out of the 11 employees, how many are from the district? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KOMBO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we do not maintain where employee on the district basis, but if he needs to know where each member of staff comes from, I Will tell him where each one comes from.The depot manager is from Kabarnet; the cashier is from Machakos; the store-keeper is from Kakamega; the assistant store-keeper is also from Kakamega; the other assistant sore keeper is from Homa-Bay, the labourer is from Kapenguria did the four watchmen come Eldoret, Kericho, Kisumu and Elgeyo Marakwet.I would only say that most of the staff are transferred from other depots. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. LOTIM: Does it mean that people from Kapenguria cannot do the job of a watchman so that they employed from outside the district? . I think, we have to keep in line with the District Focus for Rural Development strategy. How can a watchman be brought from Nyanza, Kisii, Trans Nzga bund so on? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KOMBO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, just because he knows that I come from Kisii, he is talking of "Kisii" but there is nobody from Kisii. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to say that four people have been employed since the time the depot was started and out of that at least one is from Kapenguria District. That shows that we have not refused to- employ anybody. I do, agree with the sentiments of the hone Member that we should employ people from the district. However, employees can be transferred from other districts. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. TWARITH: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like the Assistant Minister to replace those watchmen who are not from the district with Pokots from Kapenguria Township because these are very minor jobs. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KOMBO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of these watchmen were employed before the depot was started. They were transferred from other depots to go and work there and there is nothing wrong with that these are just inter-depot transfers. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. TERER: Mr. Speaker, Sir the Assistant Minister has said that these subordinate staff were transferred from other areas. When this station was established, it should have been established with new staff. So, the question of transferring people from one area to another does not arise. Can the Assistant minister tell the House why it was so necessary to transfer these people_ to West Pokot? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KOMBO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, transfers are normal. Secondly KNTC, at that time was overstaffed and so we had transfer employees to the new depot instead of sacking them. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KUBO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a very Well know fact that in this country we are trying to avoid nepotism and favourtism. It appears here that the people of Kapenguria are not been given a chance in that labour is being imported from other areas of theMR. KOMBO (CTD.)country. The question is what is the Ministry doing to make sure that in the future they do not have such labour exportation? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KOMBO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will not go for nepotism unless one is able to substantiate and say So-and-so was employed by So-and-so. It would be unfair on the part of KNTC to say that there was nepotism that was practiced. I would only say, that we have insisted that all parastatals that Fall under the ministry of commerce should employ people from the districts. Where they are working. But, if you are saying that there nepotism, I do not agree with you. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.MAKHANU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, will the Assistant Minister tell us whether¬∑ watchmen are housed or they are giving house allowance If so, does he not agree with me that it is an unnecesary expenditure on the part of the Board, the Ministry employee the locals as watchmen could stay in their own houses? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>Mr.KOMBO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, whether you are local, or not local, you are entitled to the same salary as anybody else working in the Republic, so long as you are serving under the same terms and conditions of service. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. LOTIM: Mr. Speaker, Sir, what I that when the KNTC depot was established, people were employed from Kericho and Elgeyo Marakwet and then sent to that place. They had not been employed before. Can the Assistant Minister assure the House that these people were employed before the Kapenguria depot was established? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. ROMBO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have said that two watchmen were employed by the time when the depot established. But, the other two were employed much earlier and were only transerred to Kapenguria. </NEWSPEECH>Question No. 575Waiver on A.F.C. Loan Repayment to Mr. ToiliMR. MAKHANU asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he could consider waiving Agricultural Finance Corporation loan repayment by Mr. John W. Toili of P.O. Box 218, Bungoma A/c No. 053027 and who qualifies to be exempted under the Government decision on 1989 covering such issues.<NEWSPEECH>ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE (Mr. Ngaruro): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.I cannot waive the repayment of the- A.F.C. loan advanced to Mr. Toili in 1977 as he does not qualify for exemption under the Government write off decision of 1985. Mr. Toili should therefore, make arrangements to repay the outstanding balance of Ksh.26, 370/- as at the end of September 1990. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MAKHANU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while thanking- the Assistant Minister for that reply, could he tell the House which category of farmers qualify under that government write off decision on A.F.C. loans? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. NGARURO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the following categories of farmers loans were written off where it was verified and established that default was due to factors beyond the farmers powers. The most serious area affecting farmers was the loans received before the 1984 drought year. The approved Graduated Minimum Returns claims which have been authorised by the Central Agricultural Board but there were-no _fund to settle them were to be written off. Thirdly, bad debts on wildlife damage claims which were approved since 1980 and not paid were to be written off, too. Fourthly, the bad debts involving old pineapple schemes which were given to farmers between 1967 and-1970 around Thika were to be written off. Fifthly, the G.M.R outstanding balance not covered by the approved crop. Failure but remained unpaid were to be written off. Sixthly, the group farm rehabilitation loan for which the Government had directed that such group farms be subdivided MR. NGARURO (Ctd}:were to be written off. Seventh, one further write off, although not strictly a seasonal credit was under the Kenya Livestock Development project for which the ranchers and livestock producers were given loans for primary water and access roads and that was to be written off. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KUBO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the Assistant Minister be kind enough to tell the House how much money was lost in the exercise? What is the total amount that was written off? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. NGARURO:- Mr. Speaker, Sir, something in the region of Ksh.80 million was lost in this exercise.Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the benefit of the House, I beg to lay on the Table of the House the Ministerial Statement clarifying the write off of these A.F.C. loans. </NEWSPEECH>(Mr. Ngaruro laid the document on the Table of the ¬∑House)<NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Next Question. </NEWSPEECH>Question no. 479Number of Telephone Subscribers in TavetaMR. KUBO asked the Minister for Transport and communications how many applications for telephone services have been received by the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation in Taveta since the installation of the S.T.D services at the Taveta Post Office and how many applicants have had their telephones installed.<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Mutwol): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Some 50 telephone applications were received by the Kenya posts and Telecommunications Corporation after the STD services were introduced in Taveta. Out of that, 27 subscribers who were within Taveta Town and its vicinity had their telephones installed. The other 23 could not be served immediately because they were scattered in distant places way from Taveta and that includes Chumvini, Chala and Eldora. In order to cater for Chala and Chumvini areas, a 70-line manual exchange is programmes at Chala during the year 1991/92 Financial Year. In respect of eldora, theTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Mutwol) (CTD.)area is being considered during the next Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation's five-year Development Plan which starts in 1994-1996. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KUBO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was personally present when the STD service was commissioned. The members of the public were promised that whoever needed telephone services within the whole of Taveta area would be considered. It is now strange news to hear that only those in Taveta Town and its environs can get the services because we were not told anything like that when the commissioning of the STD service was being-done. What immediate action is the Corporation going-to take to clear the image they created, that anybody applying for the service within Taveta would be served? It appears, then that they made a false promise to wananchi because, immediately after that promise, application forms were filled in and up to now, the wananchi are still waiting for the supply. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MUTWOL: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation has put a machine at Taveta which has 300 lines, but they have not all been utilised. It is only about 100 lines that are being utilised, while the rest are lying idle. the fact remains that those who are 8utside Taveta Town cannot be served by the same STD service. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KUBO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have been to the Corporation's personnel-and-the ¬∑information I-have .is that there is a special type of 'wire which they use over longer distances and that that type of wire is out of stock. Up to now the Corporation seems not to have bothered to order for that wire. Could the Assistant Minister go back and check so that he can tell us why they did not have that kind of wire which is resistant to interference? That is what I was told. This is poor planning and the Assistant Minister should agree to go back and determine the root of the matter. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MUTWOL: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is not because of poor planning. The hon. Member is talking of information from a personnel officer, who isMR. MUTWOL (CTD.)a fairly junior officer. I am giving him information that I have gathered from senior officers at the headquarters, from where planning is done and the officers know what is really happening. We are going to assist those people to get their telephone services, including that exchange I talked about in Chala which will assist the people adequately. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MALEBE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, in view of the experience the Corporation is getting from the services at Taveta, could the Corporation formulate a plan so that when they install an STD service in an .area, even in any other part of Kenya, they ensure that it is properly utilised as soon as it is commissioned? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MUTWOL: Mr. Speaker, Sir, whenever we install an STD service in any town, people are immediately allowed to subscribe fully until all the lines are allocated. Once we consider certain distances and the STD machine cannot reach them, this gives us problems, like the one we are having at Taveta and, in that case, there is normally need to have another exchange to serve those other areas. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. LEWA: Mr.: Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister talks of a given distance. Could he inform the House what this "given distance" is? What is the perimeter that can-be covered by an STO service like the one at Taveta? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MUTWOL: Could the hone Member kindly repeat the question? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. LEWA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister talked of a "certain distance" that can be covered by the STD system. Could he tell us what distance that can be by way of radious from Taveta exchange, for example? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.MUTWOL: Mr.speaker, sir, the self-trunk-Dialling (STD) service We have at Taveta Will only serve five kilometres. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.KUBO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant minister is misleading the House; I have names of subscribers in Chala and Endoro, which he has mention here: who have had telephones installed and they are using them right now. So, it is not a question of the STD service reaching far distances, but is a question of inefficiency; the corporation does not have enough Materials and personnel to do the work. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.MUTWOL: Mr.Speaker, sir from Taveta to chala is about 50 kilometers. If it true that the chief in chala has had telephone installed using the same Taveta STD service, then I will investigate this and bring more information to the House. I would like the hon. Member to give me names of subscribers from Chala who, already have telephones while other people have not been given telephones. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MALEBE : On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Is the Assistant Minister not misinforming the House in respect of the radius for STD service I know that the STD service in Meru is received in mulika Lodge of the meru national Park, which is more than 100 kilometers away. When he says STD service reaches a radius , this shows poor planning by the corporation. <NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.MUTWOL: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I did not say that every STD services serves up to that distance Some of them serve a greater distance than even that mentioned by the hon. Member: It all depends on the capacity of the machine and the hon. member is aware of that. </NEWSPEECH>MR.

Arrangements are now under way to re-tender for these works.Contract No.1 is 90 percent complete hence the amount paid to the contractor commensurate with the amount of work done.Contract NO.2 is 60% complete and the amount paid to the contractor is slightly less than the work already done. My Ministry has already made arrangements to disburse the remaining funds for this contract to the District commissioner, Kwale and the funds will be there within the next one week . </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.BIDU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the first time, I must thank the Assistant minister for his reply. But is he aware that under contract No. 2 ‚Äì road Works and bus park ‚Äì the contractor is using soil instead of murram to do the job? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.OGLE: I am not aware, Mr. Speaker, Sir. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. BIDU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if he is not aware then I am making him aware that instead of murraming the road they are putting sand--</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>HON. MEMBERS: They are putting soil. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.BIDU: Okay! They are putting soil. . Can the Assistant Minister investigate whether the contractor is using the right materials on this road? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS ANDHOUSING (MR. Mustiso): On a point of order Mr.speaker Sir. Is hon. Bidu in order to put his supplementary question in two different versions? At first he said that the contractor is using soil and later on said that he is using sand to do the road. Which is which so that the assistant Minister can know how, to respond? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Probably Mr. Bidu meant to say that the contractor is not murraming the road. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OGLE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, my main Concern here was the amount of involved in this project. Since this is a new matter that has been brought to my attention investigate and report back to the House. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.BIDU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I once more thank the Assistant Minister for his encouraging reply. Can he tell this House? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OGLE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am only being fair to the people of Kinango because this matter was not contained in the Question. I will report my finding to the house week time. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. CALCALLO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the Assistant Minister is relying on his District Plal1ning Officer, Kwale, for information with regard to this most of Question and bearing in mind. the fact that we doubt these officers in the districts,MR. CALCALLO (CTD.)Can he take it upon himself and send a monitoring unit to Kinango and ascertain that the work is done according to plan and that the money, is not misused? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OGLE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the issue of money being misused has not been raised in this question. I will set the machinery at the disposal of my Ministry in motion to carry out investigations and. I will be able to report back to the House in two weeks time. It does not matter whether I walk there or whether I assign a responsible officer to do the job. What the hon. Member expects from the ministry is a properly investigative report which will be submitted to the house in two weeks time. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.MALEBE: On a point of Order, Sir, Arising from the Assistant minister's reply, I note that there is consultancy fee under this contract to the tune of Kshs.I.65 million and consultancy fee for supervision amounting to Kshs.992,000.00. Can the Assistant Minister find out whether this payment has made for nothing? Is the Ministry, satisfied that the consultants are supervising this project effectively? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OGLE: Mr. Speaker, Sir the decision to hire consultants was arrived at by the Ministry after realising that the district did not have the capacity to cost and design projects of this magnitude. I was also decided that the consultants should be retained during construction period to ensure that contractors followed the designs as closely as possible. All the designs were endorsed by the D.D.C. before going for tender.In order for the Ministry to retain a close watch on the implementation of this project, my minster has been discussing A. I.Es in two installments for all contracts. The distinct commissioner's office writes to us immediately the first instalment is exhausted. This request is Confirmed by the consultants advising whether the funds have been properly utilized or not.In case of contract No.2, this request, has been received and confirmed by the consultants. The ministry has, therefore! sent a second A.I.E for contract No.1. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.MATE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, arising from the assistant minister's reply would it not been much easier for his ministry to liaise with the ministry of works instead of giving this money to the consultant? We know that the language applied. When it comes to hiring a consultant and at the end of the day, one ends up spending much more than, would normally be the case. Why did the ministry decide to spend so much on consultancy, Instead of giving this work to the ministry of Public works. do we not have qualified personnel in the ministry who could have done that word. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OGLE: That is a different question altogether, Mr. Speaker. However, if the hon. Member would put it separately, I would only be too glad to answer it. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.MATE: Mr. Speaker Sir, my Question is Quite relevant to the issue we are discussing. Here we are talking about spending money by hiring consultants and the Assistant minister should have expected such a Query to arise since this work ought to have been done by the ministry of public works. why do the ministry in the first place decide to give this work to a consultant thereby spending. So much money, instead of giving the work to the ministry of public works. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OGLE: I can only be able to answer that Question if it is put in the normal manner of a question to be answered in this house later. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.MATE: on a point of order, Mr. Speaker, sir. I need your audience here, because the issue I am now raising is closely related to the issue at hand here we are talking about saving money by having some piece of work done by the ministry of works instead of having it done by some consultant. Could we get your guidance on this issue, Mr. Speaker, Sir? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OGLE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the question which I came here prepared to answer is:-How much money has been set aside for the Kinango Rural Trade Programme Centre and how much has, so far, been utilised on the on-going project.This is the question that I was prepared to answer and I have already answered it satisfactorily, but surely, the hon. Member does not expect me to be able toMR. OGLE (CTD.)answer the question regarding why a consultant was involved instead of the ministry of Public work: because that is not the question that I came here to answer. If he could take the initiative of putting it as a separate question by Private notice, then I would be able to come to the House and answer it. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: could we move on now go back to Dr. misoi‚Äôs question. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.MATE: On a point of order Mr. speaker, Sir, I am standing on a to seek your guidance on this question. I still maintain that the issue that I am trying to raise is closely related to this question and the assistant minister should have expected this type of supplementaty question to be asked. Could we get your guidance on this matter because the assistant minister cannot just get away with it by saying that this is a different question when it has a lot to do with the original question. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. OGLE : Mr. Speaker, Sir, in all fairness, I think I did say it very clearly that the decision to hire a consultant and I wish to repeat this was arrived at by the ministry after realising that the District did not have the capacity to quote and design projects of this magnitude. It was also decided that a consultant should be retained during the construction period to ensure that the constrictors followed the designs as closely as possible. Ail the designs were endorsed by the district development committee before going for tender. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MAKAU: on a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. It is clearly stated in the standing Orders that ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: which Standing Order are you referring to? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MAKAU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant minister should not say that what hon. mate is trying to raise is a totally different Question which has nothing to do with the original question I am saying this because‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Order Mr. Makau! Are you therefore trying to say that it is the hon. assistant minister who invited you to ask him about the consultant fees? Is this what you are trying to say? The assistant minister has clearly stated that he is not ready to answer that question now.Shall we move on to Dr. misoi‚Äôs Question! </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.MATE: On a point of order Mr. speaker, Sir is the assistant minister really in order to try to respond to points of order which are clearly directed to the chair. I stood up seeking you guidance on this issue Mr. Speaker and the assistant minister just stands up and tries to usurp powers of the chair by responding to my point of order. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.SPEAKER: Can we move on to Mr.misoi‚Äôs question please. </NEWSPEECH>Question 554Payment of N.S.S.P. Due to Mr.arap Bormotor<NEWSPEECH>MR.SPEAKER: Mr.misoi	 is not here? Okay, can we then go on to Mr. kiliku‚Äôs question. </NEWSPEECH>Question no. 561Permanent employee for M/s priya Cesement Ltd. <NEWSPEECH>MR.BIDU : On behalf of Mr. kiliku‚Äôs, asked the minister for Labour why M/S Priya - Casements limited of P.O. LOX 90459, Mombasa/employed 14 employees as casuals since 1985, and when these employees will be employed on permanent basis. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. D.K. AMIN) Mr. Speaker, sir, I beg to reply. Priya Casement, limited Mombasa is small business which was established. in January, 1988 and. not in 1985. This company employed six casual employee and not 14 as indicated in the Question. This company has been manufacturing aluminium window and door frames whose market dement has been slow due to competition from larger companies doing a similar type of manufacturing. It is not therefore possible to convert the six casual employees to permanent employment due to the business.Another problem has been the in ability on the part of the employer, to employ a manager or a supervisor to run the business. The trend has been that whenever the proprietor is out of kombasa , the business closes down due to lack of business in aluminium manufacturing the proprietor has recently shifted from making windows and door frames to wheel barrow manufacturing.	 THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr.D.K. Amin) (CTD.)With regard to the question of when these people will be converted into permanent employment, I would like to inform the hon. Member that the employee has reluctantly agreed to convent three of them employed in 1988 into permanent employment with effect from 1st 	November, 1990. He has also promised to consider converting the other three casuals into permanent employee as soon as the business improves. </NEWSPEECH>	<NEWSPEECH>MR.LEVA: Mr. Speaker, sir, arising from the assistant ministers reply that this factory has been operative since 1988 and that these six employees are still casual employee, it appears from the activities of the company that deal with dangerous and risky business in that workers are prone to chopping of their finger or meeting with all sorts of accidents while on the job. What assurance would the assistant minister give to this house that all is well in this company with regard to the security of casual of workers who are not protected by law. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. D.W. AMIN: Mr. speaker, sir, every employee in this country is protected by the law of the land and therefore, the government is fully concerned about the welfare of every worker In this country. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR.SPEAKER: Can we now move on to question by private notice. </NEWSPEECH>	 <HEADER>QUESTIONS BY PRIVATE NOTICE</HEADER>Sacking of Staff by Igember Farmers Co-operative Society<NEWSPEECH>MR. MALEBE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Labour the following Question by Private Notice.(a) Is the Minister aware that on 30th May, 990, the management of Igember Farmers Co-operative Society declared a mass redundancy affecting over one hundred employees?(b) If the answer to 'a' is in the affirmative, what action is the Minister taking to either reinstate all the employees declared redundant or pay them their terminal benefits? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. D.M. Amin): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.I am aware that on 30th May, 990, the management of Igembe Farmers Co‚Äîoperative Society Ltd. declared 92 employees redundant. All the employees declared redundant by the management were members of the Kenya Union of Commercial Food and Allied Workers Union and immediately after they were declared redundant their union took up the matter with the management. The parties could not agree on their own, and on.20th June, 990, the union reported a formal trade dispute to me in which the issue in dispute is understood to be redundancy of 92 employees the dispute has since processed in accordance with the law and investigators have been appointed to investigate the matter and report back to me.It is the outcome of this investigation that will determine whether there was any possibility of either the workers being reinstated or being .paid their terminal benefits. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MALEBE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is true that 92 employees of Igember Farmers Co-operative Society were-declared declared redundant wrongly without reference either to the Ministry of Labour or the relevant trade union. It is also true that there is a dispute which was raised by the union to the Ministry.MR. MALEBE (CTD.)Since the management had promised in the redundancy letters to pay the employees who were affected, could the Ministry concur with the: decision of the management and order the society to pay the employees pending the outcome of the dispute between the union and the Ministry? </NEWSPEECH>	<NEWSPEECH>MR. D.M. AMIN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, unless the investigations are: over we cannot direct the: society to pay the employees. Once the investigations are over and we find that the management is supposed to pay, obviously we will take care of the employees. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MALEBE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, could the Ministry accelerate the case because the dispute is taking too long although there are no complications involved? There are documents showing that the 92 employees were officially declared redundant by the society. Since the relevant union has presented the dispute to the Ministry, could the Assistant Minister specify when the case is going to be finalized since the investigations are taking too long? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. D.M. AMIN: Sir, since we have appointed investigators to do this work we shall obviously tell them to speed up the exercise. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. MALEBE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the assistant Minister be specific and say when exactly the investigators appointed by the Ministry are going to complete the exercise? There is not much in this case it is just a question of applying delaying tactics. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. D.M. AMIN: I cannot give an exact date, Sir, but we are going to take action as quickly as possible. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Next Question. </NEWSPEECH>Release of 1990 Mungwo School K.C.P.E. Mock Results<NEWSPEECH>MR. KIPKORIR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Education the following Question by Private Notice. <NEWSPEECH>MR. KIPKORIR (CTD.)Why were this year's K.C.P.D. mock results for Mungwo Primary School in Slgeyo/Marakwet District not released? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Karauri): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to apologies because I said I would bring the answer to the House today but the answer I got is not satisfactory. We are still investigating the matter. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KIPKORIR: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is very serious for the Assistant Minister to take such a long time to come up with a satisfactory reply to a Question. Last week he promised that he would bring the correct answer and he now says that he does not have it. This is very serious. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. KARAURI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Question appeared only yesterday and not last week. I failed to answer the Question yesterday, and I apologies that I cannot give an answer even today. I am sure that the hon. Member does not want to get a wrong answer and I want to give him the correct answer. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: Next Question. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>Terms of Employment: Mr. Hilowle Mohamed. <NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. GALGALLO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Public Works the following Question by Private Notice. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS (Mr. Maiyani): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to tender my apology for not having the answer to this Question with me here. I was shown an answer in the office which proved to be incomplete and, therefore, I instructed my officers to give me a proper answer. I wish to ask that I be allowed to answer the Question next week on Thursday. </NEWSPEECH>(Question deferred)<HEADER>POINTS OF ORDER</HEADER><NEWSPEECH>MR. KUBO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. My point of order is with regard to the: provision for a dentist in Taveta Hospital. Earlier during the Session, the Assistant Minister for Health was in this House and in response to my Question, he: promised that he was going to provide a qualified dentist to the hospital by July,990 but, up to now, we do not have a dentist. I hope that the Ministry is taking the: matter seriously. Since the Minister for Health himself is here, he may wish he may clarify the matter or try to inform wananchi what is happening. Once a promise is given by a Ministry and it is not fulfilled, the wananchi are left wondering whether they should take the Ministry seriously or not. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Kibaki): Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is true that the: hon. Member for Taveta was assured that Taveta Hospital would be - provided with a dentist as soon as we got one At that time, we hoped that in six months we would get a dentist. We are sad to report that we do not have a dentist and we are not able to give him one. However, we are going to send a dentist to Taveta as soon as we get one. We want to send him a qualified dentist, but if he wants any odd fellow we shall send him there. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Mutwol): On a point of order Mr. Speaker, Sir. I rise on a point of order to find out from our newspapers what they have said and what they have not said about Harambee spirit. Kenya, as a nation, is built on the Harambee spirit and we have done quite a lot on the Harambee spirit. But of late the three daily newspapers have decided, and have chosen upon themselves, not to report much on Harambee spirit. Once the newspapers refuse to report on Harambee development in this country we count them as if they are not with us they are never with us when they refuse to do so. Quite a lot of Harambee work I being done in this country and I will quote three examples where I have participated, the latest of which did not appear in the daily newspapers. </NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Mutwol) (CTD.)On 27th October, 990, I had a Hararobee funds drive at Moi Kapsori Girls School, with Prof. Musuva as the guest of honor KShs.959, 000/- was raised and the newspapers decided not to report the occasion. That is not news to them. But let them know that it is news to this nation. I would like to remind the newspapers that a newspaper like the Daily Nation, which has a very nice title, should serve the nation. But instead of them saying that theirs is a newspaper that serves the nation, they should say that it is a newspaper that serves their masters. X would, rather, agree with that. The Kenya Times newspaper calls itself the voice of the people. Is it the voice of the people when you refuse to report development on the Harambee spirit? They are just the voice if their masters, who I do not know.Mr. Speaker, Sir, let the newspapers serve us in discriminatively regardless of religion or political status, economic status or whatever the case may be. Let us be reported equally. We are all Kenyans and we hope that the newspapers will be treating us equally.Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is very cheap for the newspapers to report when the University of Nairobi students riot or refuse to eat lunch that is the greatest news that is reported but when harambee development is done that is not news. I do not want to say much, but I just wanted to remind the newspapers that I am not happy. This is not election time when newspapers are told not to report certain individuals. That time" has not come yet. This is time for development and all development activities should be reported equally. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: I can assure you that what you have said will he record in the HANSARD. As for the newspapers, they are entitled to publish whatever they want to publish. There is nothing we can do about that. I can only request them to take note of what you have said, Mr. Mutwol. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER POR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Dr. Momanyi): On-a-point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir I rise on a point of order regarding Question No. 528 of yesterday morning when hon. Chepkok promised to lay before the House papers stating that a Mr.Chebos same retired in 1989 instead of 1986. </NEWSPEECH>(Dr. Momanyi laid some papers on the Table)<NEWSPEECH>MR. SPEAKER: It appears that hon. Chepkok is not in. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER POR AGRICULTURE (Mr. Gachui): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.Mr. Speaker, Sir, yesterday, when I was replying to Question No.526, I promised to provide papers relating to Mr. David Okioma. I have the following information to give to the House.The amount of leaf delivered by Mr. Okioma in 985/36 totalled 284 kilograms, cummulatively, for which he was paid KShs.4, 656/-. The second payment due to his 986/87-leaf was KShs.420. SO which went towards the offsetting of the debt of KShs.4, 686/- paid to him in 985/56. The balance of KShs.484.80 was later cleared by the farmer.

I am very happy because say things when the bill will be implemented my people in Mritini, me will get employment. Since one of the processing zones will be sited there.I would like to ask the Government to ensure that when export processing starts there will be no under invoicing of exports because this makes lose a lot of money. We should ensure that I non-indigenous exporters return their proceeds to this country immediately; without the export market our currency is subjected to frequent devaluations. As we are talking now our currency is derireciatirg steadily becauseof external economic forces beyond our control.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as we start implementing this Bill, I hope we will address ourselves to the Government policy of indigenisation. It is high time our people were encouraged to participate in the promotion of our economy; unless we that we shall not benefit as much as we should.with those remarks, I beg to support. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASISTANT MINISTER POR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING :(Mr. Nassire): Bw. Naibu Spika, nitasema machache to juu ya Mswade huu. Kwanza ninaznshvikuru aliuleta Mswada huu. Hii ni kva sababu nchi nyingine zimeanza kufanya yale tunayotaka kufanya kutokana na Mswada huu. Ningependa viwandcn hivi vianzishwe huko Mombasa kwa sababu tukichelewa nchi -nyingine inaweza kufanya hivyo na ikatushinda.Pia nawaomba Mawaziri wawe wakiwataka wafanyabiashara wageni wawe wsxxs wakiwashirikisha Wakenya katika biashara zao ili kuwasaidia; hili ni jambo ambalo katika ulimwengu msima.Ewa hayo machache, naunga mkono. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. JALANG'O: Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I will also make a few comments on this Bill. The main components of this Bill are generation of employment, foreign exchange and the aspect of other economic benefits to Kenya. The country is entering a very crucial stage with the passage of this Bill. Right now, the world economy is changing rapidly. What is happening in the Middle East shows that we have to move with world events? Everything that we do is foreign-exchange guided; all our imports are foreign-exchange guided; each international transaction that we do is based on what are termed today as convertible international currencies.MR.JALANG‚ÄôO (CTD.)Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is thus important that as we move into this very important stage that we live to the ideals and objecttive of this Bill. It is high time that this country save all the foreign exchange that it earns. The Bill is geared towards earning more foreign exchange through export manufacturing and also the protection of the entrepreneurs who will get into this field.MR.JALANG‚ÄôO (CTD.)It is very sad to note that what we are trying to achieve is not achieved. Time and time again, we have talked about	‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY (Mr. Kiplagat): On a point of order, Sir. I rise here to seek your guidance on this Bill. I thought that time for its debate had expired and, perhaps, only a few comments should be made on it so that the Mover can be called upon to reply. The Chair can guide us on this. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Yes. Mr. Jalang'o, KS you note that a lot of what you are saying could have been said during the Second Reading of the Bill. I urge you to conclude your remarks so that we can move to the next stage. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. JALANG'O: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I just wanted to strengthen what was discussed during the Second Reading of the Bill. I was just putting emphasis on a few points. I was just emphasizing the fact that we must protect the foreign exchange earnings of this country. I supported the Bill, during its Second Reading and I am still doing so during the Third Reading. The main objectives of the Bill should be adhered to if it has to live to its expectations.I beg to support. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Kr. Kariuki, you may now reply to the sentiments expressed by the hon. Members. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE 0F THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr. Kariuki):                                                                                                                  I would like to thank the three hon. Members who have made their final, though belated, contributions and I would like to assure them that their sentiments have been noted. In particular I would like to assure hon. Nassir who thinks that Kenya is getting late. I would like to assure him that Kenya is, in fact, one of the pioneers in Africa in as far as this scheme is concerned. The only country which I think has taken off the ground is Mauritius and we are probably second or third in Africa. I wouldMR.JALANG‚ÄôO (CTD.)also like to assure him that the first scheme is being commissioned on 30th of this month. We are, therefore, not late.	On the question of over-invoicing, I think the hon. Member should understand the operation of export processing zones. This is completely different from what we know. I do not see how how over-invoicing is going to occur because it takes place among those people who want to hide foreign exchange. They over-invoice so that they can keep some of the foreign exchange of the country. But in this case, these people will be allowed free use of the foreign exchange they earn. So there will be no question of them trying to hide any foreign exchange.With those few words, I beg to move. </NEWSPEECH>(Question put and agreed to)(The Bill was accordingly read the Third Time and passed)The Unit Trusts (Amendment) Bill<NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE (Mr.Kariuki): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move that The Units Trusts (Amendment) Bill be now read the Third Time. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER POR PUBLIC HORXS (Mr. Mibei) Seconded. </NEWSPEECH>(Question proposed)(Question put and agreed to)(The Bill was accordingly read the Third Time and passed)Second ReadingThe Kenya Medical Training College Bill(The Minister for Health on 7.11.90)(Resumption of Debate interrupted on 7.11.90)<NEWSPEECH>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Were you replying, Kr. Kibaki? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Kibaki): Yes, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I as grateful to hen. Members who spoke on this good Bill and I would like to assure them that the points they have made will be taken care of.The hon. Member for Bahari, Mr. Mtana Lewa, wanted us to have courses for auxiliary staff. I want to assure him that we are taking these courses in some of the other centres in order to make sure that whatever room is available at the medical training centres is used for training the required staff. He wants us to pursue further the collaboration between us and what we call traditional healers, traditional birth attendants and so on. But he may not know that, in fact, already the Ministry of Health not only collaborates with those people but that we have already held a couple of seminars attended by medical doctors and miti shamba doctors. These seminars have been Very fruitful indeed. In our research institutions, those miti shamba doctors have been collaborating with the research personnel.He also wanted US to create facilities to enable those who study in these training institutions to pursue farther studies. That arrangement has already been agreed upon with the university and, in fact, some people will be able to pursue these matters.With regard to hospital maintenance, it is being done in the four schools that we have at Kilifi, Meru, Loitokitok and Eldoret. We are, therefore, not going to teach it in these other institutions.The hon. Member for Cherangani, Kr. Kirwa, said that we should admit people on merit; they should come from all over the country and that we should avoid taking them on tribal basis and so on. The Board and the principal wall, in fact, behave that way because these institutions have a long history of being conducted in that manner. I am sure that they will behave that way. The matters that were worrying him with regard to the distribution of constituent college have the following explanation. These schools which are training nurses grew at a certain time; most of them were not started recently. It is, therefore, our intention to star other centres to trainTHE MINISTER FOR HEALTH (CTD.)	Norses we are hoping to start at Lodwar fairly soon. I mentioned this because hon. Kirwa had touched on it. We would like to assure him that when we spread, we will, in fact, go to the places he had mentioned. The only limitation right now is money and we are spending the resources we have on expanding existing -institutions. That way, we will be able to take more students for training rather than starting entirely new schools. Fnen we have resources, we shall start entirely new school. For the time being, the best way of spending money is to expand the schools that we actually have.Hon.Terer wants us to have a mobile unit to deal with disease outbreaks. We have mobile units which deal with communicable .diseases. For example, when there are cases of menengitis leprosy and so on, we send a mobile team immediately. We, therefore, already have these teams which the hon. Member wanted us to set up.With regard to advice on construction of health centres, I would like to say that we have plans which we are ready to give to any committee, DDC or suo-LDC upon request. They only have to go to the medical officer of health of a particular district and they will be given a plan showing the kind of EHxa health center they should build. I would advice them to utilize that facility since it is cheaper and since they will construct a satisfactory building. That is already available.THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH (CTD.)Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I agree with the entirely that when we are recruiting some categories of nurses, we should maize sure that they understand the language of the people they will be serving.With regard to the request that he made to my Ministry regarding assistance to Mission hospitals, I would like to say that as of this moment, we give a small subvention of about Shs 30 million per year to all mission hospitals, both under the National Christian Council of Kenya (K.C.C.K) and the Catholic Secretariat. However, we realise that this is indeed a very small sum but we cannot, with all honesty promise at this juncture to raise that figure since we know there is not enough funds for the time being.Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir, hon. Lamada, talked about Kapenguria district Hospital. I would like to say that we do, in fact, have a training facility at Kapenguria Listrict Hospital and. it is being used on and off Ortum. However, we are looking forward to using this training wing more effectively because we want to utilize all our existing facilities.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, hon. Kamwithi Munyi asked my Ministry to provide vehicles to both district and provincial hospitals. I would like to it is true say that it is true. We are very short of ambulances in both district and provincial hospitals. However, we do hope that in due course we are going to have a number of ambulances, but as of this moment, we do not have ar. Adequate Number we have also taken notice of his request that Frunyenjes sub-district hospital should be expanded. I would like to inform him that we are going to take care of this. However, if he was; here, I would have advises him to change this place because this place was named after a former senior chief of the area by the name/Eunyenje but the English people decided to add an at the end ana the name ended up not being African. So, we should just drop that "S" and call the pia? Junyenje we also have the same problem with Mumias. Mumias was named after Chief Munia and the some people decided to give call the place Muxias which is not African. Places their correct names, otherwise, the young people will never know that these places were names after our own people. We used to have a school in Murang'a byTHE MINISTER FOR HEALTH (CTD.)name the have ska now changed this name to Njiri School because It was named after Chief So. This is a suitable way of naming these places.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there was a very remarkable contribution from the hon. Wasiki Ndombi and we have noted the points he made. I would like to assure him that we are not actually keeping the graduates of the Kenya Medical Training School waiting because we are very short of this category of people, have other people finishing school and waiting for job opportunities but for those who finish training in this particular institution are very badly needed and we therefore post them immediately after the end of their training, and we do not keep them having around.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, with regard to clinical officers, hon. Wasiki Ndombi requested my Ministry to ensure that these cadre of medical staff are evenly distributed and that we should endeavour to send one to his place. I would like to assure him that this is going to be done and that we are looking into the possibility of sending one clinical officer fairly quickly to Lurasbi. However, this is one category of medical staff that we are terribly short of but we shall do our best to provide him with at least one clinical officer next year. Wasiki Ndombi also raised the problem, of the operation of mortuaries and about people being asked to pay money to have their deceased persons properly preserved in the mortuaries. These are matters that he should report to us, otherwise, we cannot know they are happening. If you are asked for something quietly and then you decide to keep quiet about it, then the whole thing really remains very quiet. However, we will take care of this and other points that he has raised.Kr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I cannot cover every point that was raised by all the hon. Members, but I would like to assure them that we shall maize this institution worthwhile.those few remarks, I beg to move.(Question put and agreed to)(The Bill was read a Second Time and committed to a Committee of the Whole House tomorrow)<HEADER>BILL</HEADER>Second ReadingThe Public Health (Amendment) BillTHE MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Nibaki): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move that the Public Health (Amendment) Bill be read a Second Time.This is a very small amendment Bill cut it is very significant and very important as far as we in the Ministry of Health are concerned. The hon. Members would probably be aware that the Public Health Act is, in fact, the basic law which governs what we do in order to maintain the health of Hsryans. Most of the powers that the Ministry of Health has to order people around or to close dirty places and so on, are all covered in the central Public Health Act Under this	.Act, we are authorized to have a management board. Mr. Deputy Speaker,Sir, we also want to have a district hospital management board in every district hospital, so that the people who live inside that district, will be able to be close to their own hospital and be able to watch what is happening in their own hospital. They will also be able to know how much money is being allocated. This board will also be able to know what staff is working in the hospital. They will also be able to know what that hospital is spending its servicesyand be able to supervise the operation of the hospital. In this way, they will be able to know whether the patients are being well treated or whether the items bought for the hospitals are actually taken to the hospital or put into other use by some our crupulous characters. Therefore, we are bringing this amendnent bill to make sure that people are brought closer to their institutions.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, in this era of district focus for rural development, we would like the people E being served by a school, hospital and so on, to be associated, with the running of these places. That is why in the case of education, have set up the Parents/Teachers AssociationsAnd the boards of Governors and so on so the trey are able to care of their own sidbe institutions. The thing will apply to our hospitals do not want our people to feel that a hospital is an isolated these institution when we know that the money that is spend to run hospitals is actual their own money. So, we would like to have these district boards at the lower level here we have the health centres. In these yrrgs areas, we would like to have local committees which will supervise these health centres. In this way, the Ministry will be able to communicate with the people. The problems that face people right down at the locationai level will be communicated to the Ministry as a matter cf course and will not have to wait until the Masher for the area r asks a Question in this Eouse or writes a complaint to the Ministry and So, we shall get on knowing the day-to-day problems affecting our people at the lowest level. In this way, we shall make sure that we serve the people effectively. This Amendment Bill therefore, authorise us to set up these supervisory institutions, and the idea is to have I district medical officer of health as the secretary of that board after which we shall have other people including the local leaders, the councillors, kzn lianu officials and elders that are acceptable in the local community.THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH (CTD.)This is really what we are looking forward to, and this Bill will enable us to do that kind of work. We are very keen that monies which are allocated to buy beddings, linen, cutillery and other things for a hospital should be supervised by the local people to ensure that there is genuine tendering and genuine buying. That exercise should not be left to one or two persons because it includes large resources. When you think about the amount of money spent for buying those kinds of things for one hospital per year, it is a very substantial amount and we want the local people to be involved and to know that all this money is being well spent.Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is very important because when we want to also call on the Harambee spirit, there will be people who can at least speak about the institution which is theirs. Although Government will go on providing the resources, the supervision will be brought closer to the people. That is the whole purpose of this small amendment. It is very important. It is an urgent matter and we have checked how we will be administering it. We will soon be requesting for proposals from various places regarding the persons who might serve on this particular board.With those few remarks, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move. </NEWSPEECH></NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Nassir): Bw. Naibu Spika, kuongeza tu alivyosema Bw. Waziri, wakati hasa we viongozi kujua taabu za wananchi ndio kitu kikubwa sana. Viongozi yafaa wawemo katika mambo ya kupeleka afya, elimu na hata usalama kuliko na watu. Viongozi waki- weza kuingia katika mambo kama hayo na kuelewa ni taabu gani zilir.oko, basi wananchi watafurahi. Yafaa viongozi wajue, kwa mfano, kuna taabu gani katika hospitali na baada ya kamati kuzungumza wajue hatua za kuchukua. Hata ikiwa ni kwenda kumwona Waziri, litakuwa jambo kubwa sana ambalo tulikuwa hatur.a zamani. Ikiwa mtu amekwenda kumwona Waziri, yaweza kuwa ni mhe. Mbunge amefar.ya hivyo lakini mara moja kwa mwaka. Inawezekana pia kwamba huenda huko akiwa THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Nassir) (CTD.)na ndugu yake mgonjwa. Leo mwananchi wa Kenya ataona raha kujua kwamba baada ya Serikali yake kumjengea hospitali kutakuwa na watu wa kwenda kuangalia kama mambo yao yanatimizwa sawasawa. Langu ni kuiomba kamati tunayounaa hapa kwanza iangalie mambo ya usafi. Kama turiawauguza wagonjwa na hospitali ni chafu, basi tutakuwa hatufanyi kitu. Pia, kama tunawaiiguza wagonjwa na hakuna karatasi ta kuandikia, tutakuwa hatufanyi kitu. Ni vibaya pia kama tutawauguza wagonjwa na tuwe hatuna dawa. Yafaa kamati tunayotaka kuunda hapa isikilize mahitaji ya wananchi, hata ikiwa ni mara moja kwa mwezi au mara mbili ndiposa waelewe taabu zao. Ni lazima kamati hii iangalie "ni kwa sababu gani tunakosa dawa." Je, dawa ze?tu zin'aibwa au ni mambo mengine gani yanayoendelea. Kamati ya aina hii ndiyo itakayoondosha shida za mwananchi.Bw. Naibu Sika, hapo zamani kulikuwa namtinao wa kuilaumu Serikali kwa jumla Wizara moja ikifanya makosa, bila kutazama ni watu gani wanaofanya makosa. Ikiwa ni upande wa afya kumekuwa na makosa fulani, wagonjwa hawakutazama ni ofisa gani aliyesababisha makosa hayo; wailaumu tu Serikali kwa jumla. Sisi sote ni Serikali na ni lazima tuitumikie Serikali yetu sote, na njia ya kufanya hivyo ni moja tu. Ikiwa ni hapa katika Bunge, basi kazi yetu ni kuhakikisha kwamba pesa zinatolewa na kupeanwa katika kila wilaya.(Mr. Deputy Speaker left the Chair)(The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Kagwima ) took the Chair)Bw. Naibu Spika{ kamati hii ikiundwa na ione kwamba kuna watu ambao hawaoati P dawa, basi kazi yake itakuwa ni kuondosha upungufu wa dawa na hivyo kuwaletea wananchi nafuu kubwa sana. Pia, kamati hiyo itasaidia katika mipango ya kuwaajiri watu kazi. Ikiwa ni katika Wilaya ya Mombasa, kamati itahakikisha kwamba watu wa kufagia na torishi hawatolewi kutoka mahali pengine. Pia nataka kamati hii ipewe uwezo wa kumwona yeyote and ehusika na dawa na msimamizi wa hospitali. Tukiweza kufanya hivyo na ma/nbo yakaenaelea vizuri, hospitali kama ya Wilaya ya Mombasa hazitakuwa na shida. Kutakuwa na usafi ufaao.THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Nassir) (CTD.)Bw. Naibu Sika wa Muda, katika hospitali nyingine utakuta kwamba nguo za kitanda zilinunuliwa miaka 10 iliyopita. Kwa hivyo, kamati kama hii tunayounda hapa itaweza kuchunguza mambo hayo na ikiwezekana ifanye Harambee kupata pesa za kununua nguo mpya. Hizi ni hospitali zetu na tukifanya Harambee tutakuwa tunaji- saidia wenyewe. Kwa mfano, kama kwetu Mombasa, kamati inaweza kuchukua watu watano au sita na wanunue nguo za kitanda. Tunaweza kufanya mambo haya kwa kuiendeleza Serikali yetu. Hatutaki tena mtindo wa kuilaumu Serikali kwa jumla kunapotokea makosa katika Wizara fulani.Kwa hayo machache, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, naunga mkono.(Question proposed)<NEWSPEECH>MR. MAKAU: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir I would first of all like to pay very special tribute to His Excellency the President because he has been in the forefront in the promotion of health services in this country particularly through the construction of Nyayo Wards. His Excellency the President demonstrated is concern for the welfare of Kenyans when he scrapped cost sharing that had been introduced in Government hospitals. The cost sharing policy was faced with a lot of administrative problems and it also caused untold suffering to wananchi because the majority were unable to raise money to pay for medical treatment in Government hospitals.This amendment to the Public Health Act, which introduces district health committees is bringing the administration of health services closer to the people. This is an amendment that is long overdue; it should have been brought earlier. This is because people in the districts have many problems facing them. I say this because hospitals in the districts lack essential medical facilities. Questions have been asked in this House and answers given to the effect that various items have been sent to particular hospitals but the items that were sent to the hospitals never reached those hospitals. It is not possible to know whom go to when such a thing happens. The establishment of these district health committees I am sure we will have people who will be responsible for effective management of health centres.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I urge the Ministry of Health to draw a very comprehensive drug policy. I say this because everybody is allowed to import drugs into this country. But the Ministry should look into this matter and come up with a drug policy in order to regulate the importation of drugs into this country. The Ministry should not leave the importation of drugs open to everyone.We should only import the drugs that are needed in this country. We should not allow every type of drugs to be imported into this country, I say that because some of these drugs may have harmful side effects. We have read in medical journals about drugs that have been found to be defective. An example is the birth control drug known as Depo-provera which was found to have bad side effects. So, this is why I am saying that it is necessary for us to have a comprehensive drug policy in this country. This is also because there are many fake drugs that are being sold in various parts of the world. We are lucky in Kenya because these fake drugs have not yet found their way into this country. The Ministry should look into this matter. The Director of Medical Services has said that they are worried about these fake drugs and so this matter should be looked into. This is an area that needs a lot of attention. While we appreciate that ours is a free market, we should know what is being imported into this country. Some people know that ours is a free market and they may import any drugs into this country and mount advertising campaigns to sell the drugs. They will do that because they know that we have no comprehensive drug policy in this country.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, another area that the Ministry should look into is the formulation of a strategy to enable it to control outbreaks of diseases like meningitis and plague. We know that the Ministry is trying its best to control disease outbreaks in this country. The Ministry should not just wait until there is an outbreak of a disease in a certain place just to sent a team of medical personnel there hurriedly. We must have a comprehensive strategy to enable us to control meningitis. This disease has broken out in various parts of this country including my constituency, Mbooni. We should not party about with semantics when the lives of our people are threatened by disease.It does not matter whether an outbreak is an epidemic or not. This is because even when only one Kenyan dies, that is a great loss to this country. So, we should have a specialised team of medical officers who will always be ready to rush to a place whenever an outbreak of a disease occurs.About a week ago there was an outbreak of plague in Katheka Eai area in Mua Hills, Machalros District. A number of people died in that area and that was not the first outbreak of the disease. So, the Ministry should devise a strategy to eradicate these outbreaks whenever they occur. They should not wait to rush to a place when there is an outbreak and begin telling us that it is not an epidemic. We had already forgotten about the plague but it seems to be staging a come back to our country. We appear to be moving backwards instead of moving forward.My next point regards the area of research. Recently our scientists at the Kenya Medical Research Institute discovered the drug Kemron.There have been a lot of reports in the newspapers about the ownership of Kemron; We should all realise that people in the developed countries will never recognise any scientific discoveries from the Third world countries and particularly African, countries. Stay From the report that have appears in the media it appears that there is no co-ordination. But the fact remains that Kemron was invented by our own scientists. We should be specific about that The Director of Medical Services should work together with the Director of Kenya Medical Research Institute and forget about the issue of who is distributing or marketing Kemron. They should not tell us that they are still carrying out clinical tests on this drug. When this drug was launched it was stated clearly that it was found effective in reversing the symptoms of AIDS. We are not the country that is struggling to find a cure for the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome - AIDS. </NEWSPEECH>MR. MAKAU (CTD.)Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we should take advantage of the fact that neighbouring countries are also testing Kemron and that the World Health Organization has responded positively to the discovery of this drug by Kenyan scientists Since we are also using a lot of foreign exchange to import other drugs into this country We should be able to compensate ourselves by selling Kemron to other countries. Kemron should help us to manage AIDS in this country. The drug has been recognised internationally.MR. MAKAU (CTD.)We should be able to compensate ourselves by selling this drug to other countries. I would, therefore, like to urge the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) and the Director of Medical Sales to work together so that we may produce this drug in this country. We have read although I would not like to raise the issue here that a certain organisation did this and that in the United States of America and that somebody else did something else. What is important, however, is that Kenyans and other people in the neighbouring countries are anxiously waiting for this drug. Most important of all, we should not start arguing because if do so another country will discover another drug that is more potent, in which case, we will not be able to sell our own drug which every Kenyan is waiting to hear about. Everybody here wants to know how much we are getting from the sale of KEKRON in Uganda, Tanzania and elsewhere, instead of mere talk about a company that has the marketing right of the drug. We should not keep on playing about with the marketing of something that will bring a lot of foreign exchange to this country. At the same time, we should not have any controversy over something that is our pride. Instead, we should be careful with outsiders who may come in, knowing that this drug was manufactured in Kenya, and blackmail us and show that Africans could not have done so. We do not have to carry statements in the Kenya Times or The Weekly Review on who did what. The dosage of Interferon that was used here was supplied here and the relevant clinical tests were done here. If anybody knew that they could have done this elsewhere, why did they not do so there? This is not the time for them to bring confusion just because they want to show that the African cannot make any invention. The drug should be sold internationaly so that we may earn foreign exchange and our people have access to the drug.Finally, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Ministry of Health, especially the Medical Officer of Health and his personnel in Machakos. With these amendments, I am glad that the Ministry is going to improve on the job it is doing. I thank the Ministry because it has been very particular in ensuring that health centres and dispensaries started on a HarambeeMR. HAKAU (CTD.)basis are supplied with both personnel and drugs. This has happened in Kalawa Location, which is a very difficult area of ray constituency. We put up a dispensary on a Harambee basis in Mutembuku, a difficult area bordering Machakos and Kitui, and the Ministry responded very fast by providing medical personnel and drugs. The wananchi there are very happy with the dispensary, and I thank the Ministry very sincerely on behalf of the people of Mbooni Constituency. With the introduction of the suggested board, we would like to see more Harambee dispensaries being provided with personnel and drugs.With these few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the Bill. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>DR. MISOI: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I also rise to support this Public Health (Amendment) Bill, this Bill will go a long way towards providing the much needed services to our people. I thank the Ministry of Health and the Government in general for the work they have done, especially in ensuring that medical services are available at affordable costs to the majority of Kenyans.Diseases do not have eyes. Therefore, even the richest and the poorest of our people are susceptible to them. If proper and reasonably‚Äîpriced medical services are not available, the majority of our people will suffer. It is, therefore, important for the Ministry to ensure that these services Eire not only available, but also spread out all over the country.There has often been an outcry over drug shortages in hospital and other health institutions. People have been told to buy them in pharmacies, and these drugs are quite costly. The average Kenyan will always have a problem in purchasing drugs from a pharmacy. Most drugs are imported but, with the present increase in our population and unemployment, there is need to look at the pricing of our drugs so that the cost is kept at a reasonable level. We are, of course, very grateful that, at least, one drug has been identified in this country, although we still have a conflict in respect of the people who produced it. This drug is called KEMRON, and we hope that this drug will be sold in international DR. MISOI (CTD.)markets. The discovery of this anti-AIDS drug is a step in the right direction, and we only hope that research will continue not only towards the production of this particular drug, but also towards improving it. We are sure that it is effective against AIDS.It is also important for the Government to ensure that those who work on this type of research are well remunerated so that they may continue to serve this nation. If we do not do this, we will lose these fellows to other sectors where they derive reasonable economic benefits. So, I call upon the Government and the Ministry concerned to ensure that these people are properly graded. There have been instances where some institutions have been regarded as being service‚Äîoriented and their personnel given very low salaries while a similar grade of personnel working in different institutions are paid very well, we must realise that medical workers manage a very technical and professional field equivalent to any others of their level.It is important that those who manage these institutions are trained well because it is not good to have a professional person with no experience managing an institutions finances. Such people should be exposed to senior management courses and seminars so that they may do a good job thereafter.DR. MISOI (CTD.)Of course, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, public health is a very important area for our people particularly as it pertains to places like kiosks where wananchi eat their food. These are the kinds of places the Government should look into to ensure that the food is served in hygienic, conditions. Those carrying out those businesses should be educated not only on how to serve the food but on how to store it as that will reduce the cases of epidemics that may arise due to unhygienic storage conditions. These are people who want to sell, this food so as to earn a living and, at the same time, be of service to those workers who cannot afford to eat in hotels, like is the case with those workers in industrial areas. The Ministry could assist by also proposing accepted modules of eating houses which are cheap but decent so that people can enjoy their fairly cheap meals while being safeguarded against any unhygienic exposure.There has also been a number of complaints on losses of drugs in the hospitals and health centres, most of which drugs find their ways to private health clinics. The Ministry should institute procedures whereby those who are charged with such responsibilities can maintain discipline and work without temptations to sell those drugs. Those drugs do not simply get lost just like that; they get lost because some people get benefits out of selling them to private pharmacies and clinics. Although some of the drugs are labelled "GK", that is not a guarantee that they will not get lost, as they can be repacked in other containers and wrappers. The Ministry should try to seal that loophole so that wananchi can have those drugs in hospitals.With those few remarks, I support the Bill. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. J.N. MUNGAI: Ahsante sana, Bw. Naibu Spikawa Muda, kwa kunipa nafasi hii pia niweze kuungana na Wabunge wenzangu kutoa maoni kuhusu Mswada huu unaohusu Wizara ya Afya. Kwa kuwa mengi yamesemwa na Wabunge walionitangulia, nitasema machache tu.Huu ni Mswada unaolitegemea taifa na taifa haliwezi kuoneMR. J.N. MUNGAI (CTD.)Kana likiwa kama taifa ikiwa litakuwa na unyonge, hasa ikiwa ni kutokana na mambo ya afya kutotiliwa maanani.Nasema hayo nikiwa na fikira za huduma za maji. Kila biashara inatakikana kufanywa katika hali ya usafi hivi kwamba hata sehemu kunako- fanyiwa biashara zozote kunatakikana kuwa kumepakwa rangi ili kuthibitisha kuwa afya inadumishwa. Lakini shida kubwa sana, na ambapo ningependa Waziri aingilie sana kwa kushirikianana Waziri mwenzake anayeshughulikia mambo ya maji, ni kwamba kuna sehemu ambako kuna ukosefu wa maji na hata ingefaa kuwe na sheria ambapo maofisa Fulani wanaweza kufikishwa kortini kwa kuacha hali kama hiyo kuweko. Ikiwa wale wanaoshindwa kuziweka biashara zao katika hali ya usafi wanafikishwa kortini, basi, vile vile maji yanapokosa, wale wanaohusika na huduma hiyo wawe pia wakifikishwa kortini kwa sababu ikiwa tutaendelea kuwapeleka watu upande mmoja kortini na wengine tunawaacha kuwa huru, basi itaonekana sheria haitoi haki inayofaa.Ukinagalia sehemu Fulani katika mawakilisho yangu, utaona kuwamara nyingi maji hayapatikani. Mji wa Molo, na hata Elbtirgon, hakuna huduma ya maji ya kutosna. Sasa imekuwa kwamba huduma hiyo inakatizwa mara kwa mara. Upande wa Njoro unaweza kukaa hata wiki moja bila kupata maji na hali kuna mahoteli, vilabu, vituo vya afya na mahali kwingine kwingi ambako wananchi wanafanya biashara zao. Itawezekanaje wananchi wawe na afya ya kutoshna hali hakuna maji? Badala ya Waziri kuwa akione kana akiwapeleka maofisa wake katika sehemu mbali mbaliza nchi hii ili kuhakikisha kuwa kuna usafi katika biashara zote zinazoendelezwa, ingekuwa bora kama wale wanaokatiza huduma ya maji pia wangeshitakiwa na kufikishwa kortini. Sioni ni kwa nini wakati kama huu kuna idadi kubwa zaidi ya watu kunakuwa na ukosefu wa maji wakati yanapohitajika zaidi. Mara nyingi una sikia kuwa mifereji iliyowekwa ilikuwa midogo kwa kuwa mipango hiyo ilikuwa ni ya wakati wa zamani ambapo hakukuwa na haja kubwa sana ya maji. Afya haijui kama kuna maji ya kutosha ama la, na pia haijui ni lini mipango yaMR. J.N. MUNGAI (CTD.)Kuweka mifereji ilikuwa ikifanyika, na ilifanyika kwa njia gani. Afya inakuwa imeimarika ikiwa kuna maji na kadhalika, na inakosekana inapokuwa hakuna maji na hivi maafa yanaingia kupitia kwa magonjwa ya aina mbali na wananchi wanaanra kwfa. Ingefaa kila mara idadi ya watu inanozidi kuonoezeka huduma hizi zionoezwe Dia ili usafi udumishwe. Kwa niia hivo uooniwa hauwezi kuwa ukisambaa iinsi unavvosambaa wakati kuna ukosefu wa maii.Mara nvinai wananchi wetu wanateseka sana kutokana naukosefu wa huduma kama hizi. Jambo la kustaa iabisha ni kwamba hakuna hatua vovote inavochukuliwa kwa wale wanaowafanya wananchi wateseke hivvo. Kwa hivvo. Ingefaa maofisa wa afya waDatiwe mamoavti wezo wa kuwafikisha kortini wale maofisa wengine wanaohusika na kazi ya maji na ambao hawafanyi juhudi za kutosha kuona kwamba huduma ya maji haikatizwi.Tunatoa shukrani kwa Bw. Waziri kwa huduma anazotutolea katika mambo ya afya. Mara nyingi tunapotembea hospitalini kuwaona ndugu na mara- fiki wanaougua huko, tunaona huduma zinazotolewa. Lakini upande mwingine. Utaona kuwa kuna hali nyingine zinazofaa kuchunguzwa. Nasema hivyo kwa sababu, kwa mfano, sioni ni kwa nini wagonjwa wawili wanabidiika kulala kwenye kitanda kimoja; blanketi na godoro moja. Utaona kwamba pengine yule aliye mgonjwa zaidi anakojoa kwenye godoro na inakuwa ni vibaya sana kwa huyo mgonjwa mwingine ambaye si mgonjwa sana. Hata ingawa Waziri ameweza kuyarekebisha mambo mengi sana katika hospitali zetu, ingefaa ajaribu kuli-chunguza jambo nililotaja.Ningetaka kutoa mfano mwingine wa kisa cha hospitalini. Tulienda kumwona mgonjwa mmoja ambaye alikuwa amefikishwa hospitalini kujifungua mtoto. Tulipofika hospitalini tuliambiwa kwamba hakuku wa na pamba yoyote huko. Unaweza kufikiria mambo kama hayo. Mama anatokwa na damu na, hata siwezi kusema zaidi ya hali hiyo. Sasa hali ikiwa hivyo unaambiwa kuwa hakuna pamba na hali mko hapo kama jamaa yake amkiangalia shida kama hiyo. Hiyo inakuwa ni aibu sana. Ninatoa mfano huu kwa sababu ni wa kweli. Tuli-bidiika kutoka na kununua pamba kibinafsi ili huyo mama ahudumiwe vizuri.MR. J.N.MUNGAI (CTD.)Bw. Naibu Spika wa ifuda, ningetaka maofisa wanaohusika waone kamba vifaa hivi vinapatikana kwa urahisi katika hospitali. kaofisa wengine ni kama wanaipinga Serikali. utaon kwamba wagonjwa fulani wanajichulia pamba hospitali na hali kuna wengine wanaopata pamba huko hospitali. wengine, wanapojua mtu ni Mbunge, wanatoa vitu kama pamba kwa haraka asijue yale ambayo huendelea. Hawa ni maofisa ambao wanataka kuiharibu sifa ya Serikali kwa kuwataa bisha wananchi. kwa hivyo, ningetaka waziri ahakikishe kwamba maofisa wake ni wazalendo na wanawatumikia wananchi vizuri.Ingefaa pia ashirikiane na Wizara ya Serikali za Mitaa katika kuendeleza afaya ya jamii. Maofisa wa afya ya jamii we Wizara wanaijali kasi yao lakini ni vigumu kuona kinachofanywa na maofisa wa Serikali za Mitaa. Utaona kwamba mapipa yanayowekwa nje ya mahoteli na mitaa inayoishi yanajaa takataka ambayo inabaki bila ya kusombwa hadi inapooza na jambo hili ni hatari kwa afya ya watu. Ingefaa watu kama hawa, ambao huwa wamepewa magari ya kuzoa takataka, wachukuliwe hatua za kisheria wanapokosa kuzoa takataka na kataki wa waeleze kwa nini hawafanyi kazi yao kame inavyotakikarna. Hii itawafanya wananchi waone kwambo Serikali inafuata sheria zake.Iaofisa wengine si wasalendo; wanapokosa kufanya kasiyao watakwanbia wamekosa kitu kama mafut a na hali wana mafuta yan kutosha na wanachotaka ni kuwadhulumu wananchi tu. Kutozoa takataka ni hatari kwa sababu kunaweza kusababisha magonjwa kama kipindupinduambapo Serikali itatumia pesa nyingi kuyatibu magonjwa hayo na pia kutafuta chanzo chake. Kwa hivyo, afya ya jamii ni kasiinayohitaji kuianywa kwa makini na usalendo mkubwa kwa sababu ni msingi wa afya bora kwa taifa na pia kwa sababu magonjwa yakitokea yanatumia pesa nyingi, hata sa kigeni kuagisia vifaa ambayo haviko MR. J.N. MUNGAI (CTD.) Hapa nchini.Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, pia ningetaka Wizara iweikifanya semina za kuwaeleza juu ya umuhimu wa afya ya jamii.Hii ni kwasababu watu wengine, hasa wafanyahiashara, wanapokatazwa leseni za hiashara hadi watakapo timiza mambo fulani kama kuzipaka nyumbazao rangi hufikfri wanadaulumiwa au ni hongo inayotakikana. Ikiwa watu kama hawa watapelekwa kwa wengine ambao wamefanya mambo kama kuoaka nyumba rangi ZESDC na kusafisha mitaro watajua wanayo takiv a kufanya na hawatakuwa wakilalamika na pia afya ya jamii itakuzwa Maofisa wengine wana tabia ya kuangalia mahali ambapo watu wensri wa huwa na shughuli fulani kama vichinjioni Lakihi aata senemuamoazo hazijulikani sana ziangaliwe.Kwa vile mengi yamesemwa juu ya Mswada huu, sitaki kuendelea sana nisi je nikarudia yale ambayo yamesemwa.Kwa hayo machache, naunga mkono. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER OF STATE, OFFICE OP THE PRESIDENT (Mr.- Nabwera) Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me this opportunity to contribute to this very important Bill.: First of all, I would like to thank the Minister for Health, the hon. Member for Othaya, for bringing up this amendment to theBill, which is very timely. I would like us to debate these amendments in such a way that what comes out of our discusion will be useful for the development of our country.THE MINISTER OF STATE, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Nabwera) (CTD.)The philosphy behind the creation of these hospital boards and healthcentre and dispensary committees is important and has far reaching implications. It means that, through the Ministry of Health the Government is attemptingto transfer the responsibility of looking after our public health institutions to our community or the people. It means that our people should take this responsibility seriously and that they should be involved in running these hospitals, health centres and dispensaries.It is no longer the question of when we expected the Government to do everything. As I listen to the contribution made by the hon. Member for Molo, I gathered that he seems to look at these public officials as if they were world apart. No. The philosophy behind this is that if we have a health centre at Molo, the people of Molo should assume responsibility for that institution. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. J.N. MUNGAI: Ona point of order, Sir. I think the hon. Minister did not get me well. There is nothing evil in what I said about healthofficers and their approach to business people. This is because at times they stress too much and at times the business people mistake them. Is it, therefore, in order for the Minister to impute that I am trying to criticise health officers when all I said is that they should take responsibility of running health institutions and that the business people should also adhere to their line of responsibility? When I talked about seminars, I had in mind some kind, of seminars where business people could ask questions and where health officers could advice the community on various issues. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwima): Order! That is not a point of order, Mr. Mungai, but you were just informing the Minister what you meant in your earlier contribution. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER OF STATE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr.Nabwera): Sir, I am quite sure that that was not a point of order and if the hon. Member had given me a few more minutes, he would have found that his thinking and mineTHE MINISTER OF STATE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr.Nabwera) (CTD.)are not at variance. I was, in fact, elaborating on what he has said. I was explaining that if there is a health centre at Molo and I have one in mind at Mautuma which I will touch an in a few minutes - it is the responsibility, under this new arrangement , of the people of Molo - including the hon. Member to make sure that these institution is properly looked after. The Ministry of Health will post staff there and give medicine but considering the economic situation that is facing this country and others, it means that the community can do much more.When the Minister moved this amendment, he said that the people sitting on-hospital boards, district boards, and health centre committees now have to make sure that those facilities function properly. We have good people who should be members of these boards and committees. We have many retired public servants, many businessmen and businesswomen and farmers in those areas where we have these institutions. The Government expects the local community around health institutions to treat as if they were their property so that you-get some of these people	‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. J. N. MDUGAI: On a point of order, Sir. I agree with the advice given by the Minister but these committees are not charged with the responsibility of doing check ups in hospitals every now and then. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwima): What is your point oforder? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. J.N. MUNGAI: MY point of order is: Is it in order for the H-hon.Minister to emphasize that the committees are charged with the responsibility of supervising the doctors? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER OF STATE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Nabwera): That is precisely what the Government is saying. I do not know why the hon. Member for Molo who has been here long enough cannot distinguish what is a point of order from a point of argument, what he is doing is to argue rather to let me speak as I sat here quietly listening to him. Why can he not listen to me?THE MINISTER OF STATE, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Nabwera) (CTD.)The hon. Minister who moved this amendment, said specifically that we as the local community must now get involved in ensuring that the medicine that has been sent by the Government to the hospitals and health centres is properly used. It is the duty of the hospital boards and committees to ensure that. For example, if the Government buys bed sheets for thepatients, the boards and committees must make sure that they are used for the intended purposes. I would go further and say that under this new arrangement and if we are serious about developing our country, local committees and boards should assume full responsibility of making sure that these institutions are spotlessly clean. Members of Parliament and other leaders can organise Ear abbess for fetching these institutions and for employing casual workers to keep these institutions clean. That is part of the job. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. J. N. MUNGAI: On a point of order, Sir. I thought we are paying service charge to the local authorities. Is it in order for the Members of Parliament to organise Minister to ask members of parliament to organize Harambees in their constituencies instead of being served with the money they are paying to the local authorities? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER OF STATE, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Nabwera): Sir, I do not know what has happened to my hon. colleague. If he has a copyof the Bill with him, I will like him to turn to 7 (b) which reads as follows:"There shall be established a district health management board in each district which will be charged with the responsibility of overseeing the running of the Government health institutions in that district."  </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. J.N.MUNGAI: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary deputy Speaker‚Äì‚Äì </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwisa): Order Mr. Mungai: Mr. Nabwera is still dealing with a point of order Could you givehim time to do so? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER OF STATE, OFEICE OF THE PRESIDENT (MR. Nabwera): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, that is what this Amendment Bill is talking about and I was just elaborating and saying that in a given district, for example, Kakamega, once these boards are established, the Minister must make sure that these boards sort out the problems that we have been talking about. These are the problems that have prompted hon. Members to askMinisters Questions in this Eouse from time to time. I am sure that thesehoards will be in a position to answer some of these questions and I was going further to say that as a nation, if we are going to make the full useof these institutions, then these committees and boards must go beyondtheir just being spectators. This is where I would like the good men and women in this country, who have retired from the Public Service orwho may be industrialists or engaged in one form of economic activities orthe other, to be appointed to these boards and committees so that they canmake their contributions for the welfare of our people throughoutthe country. In this way Kenya will be running its own helathservices in a completely different manner from the way these servicesare now being run.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I was saying that Governmentwill provide-the staff as it does in our schools, where the Ministry of Education provides teachers in our schools, but we do the development. This is becauseGovernment resources are limited and this means that they do not have provide enough money to/provide all the facilities that are required in our districthospitals or in our health centres. However, we can as a people be able totake care of our health facilities. After all, we have shown quite clearlythat we can take care of our educational facilities by building both primaryand secondary schools through Harambee and the Government has been providing us with teachers. Therefore due to budgetary constraints and due to‚Äì‚Äì </NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER OF STATE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT (Mr.Nabwera) (CTD.)The fact that diseases do not warn us when they come, these committees and the hoards, will, through our harambee motto, he able to start their own small savings accounts for running their institutions. This means that whenever we run short of drugs in any one given area, they would be able to supplement what there is so that nobody in Kenya goes unattended due to shortage of drugs.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to our people to continue with their self-help spirit and join hands with the ministry of Health to make sure that our health facilities continue running smoothly. We have built wonderful schools through the Earambee self-help approach which has .enabled us to be the fastest developing country in Africa because of what we started in 1963. This spirit should permeate the whole of our social lives and this is what my colleage, the Minister of Health, has done by bringing this amendment. So, I hope that fee at the end of the day, when our people have understood what the Government expects us to do, we shall be able to undertake these responsibilities. We hope that as we go round the country, we shall find our people involved in the running of the dispensaries and health centres.After all, these health facilities have been built on Harambeebasis and we are just saying that‚Äî‚Äî </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. J.N. MUNGAI: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, looking at the amendment before the Eouse, I tend to thinkthat the Minister is trying to imply that we shall now start running the facilities in this country, through Harambee basis. I am saying this because the question of health is a verysensitive question and therefore, is it in order for the hon. Minister to say that these committees and boards will sort of be calling upon the villagers to go and start cleaning hospitals and cleaming drainages and so on so that we car be seen to be working in the spirity of Harambee. It is the responsibility of the employees of the Ministry to see to it that something good is being done. He cannot leave everything to these committees and boards. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER OF STATE, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Nabwera): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker Sir, I do not know what is happening to my colleague today. He is just trying to put words into my mouth. He is misinterpreting everything I am trying to say. I wonder whether the hon. Member had enough sleep last nighthe seems to be having a lot of problems in comprehending what I am saying. What I as saying is that most of the dispensaries and health centres throughout the Republic have been put up on a Earambee basis and what we are asking the Government to do is to post staff to these institutions and to give us enough medicine. The Ministry of Health is able to buy only a limited amount of medicine due to the limited money voted by this House. This medicine is send to hospitals throughout the country and consequently there are certain hospitals which run short of these drugs and do not have more drugs forthcoming from the Government. I was saying that under our Harambee motto which was established at Independence these health committees and boards, could organise harambee to provide the drugs. I would be glad to organize the first harambee of this kind in one of the health centres in my place and I will invite my colleage, the hon. Member for Molo Constituency. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. Mwenje): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, Is the hon. Member for Molo really in order to misinterprete the object of the Bill? It looks quite clear that the hon. Member has not read the Dill. I am saying this because he previously supported the Bill but he is now contradicting himself. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwima): Eon. Mungai, would you like to clarify the position? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>MR. J.N. MUNGAI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am not trying to misinterprete the objective of the Bill, what I m saying is that in the course of his contribution, the Ministry tended to overemphasize the role of the Earambee spirit in this country. Although we know that some of these health centres and dispensaries were built onMR. J.N. MUNGAI (CTD.)Marasbee basis and the Ministry then posted the staff to mann then, it is true that the whole responsibility of running these institutions rests squarely on the Ministry, and not the committees or boards. These committees or boards can only oversee or supervise to ensure the smooth running of these places but not engage themselves in cleaning blankets and the drainages in the hospitals and health centres. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr.Kagwima): Order It is provided for in our Standing Orders that hon. Members have the freedom to express themselves in this Eouse and there is no limit to which one can go. So, I think the hon. Minister was quite in order to raise the point of introducing harambee spirit in the running of health centres and dispensaries. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE MINISTER OF STATE, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Nabwera): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think I agree with my hon. Colleague‚Äôs sentiments.What I was saying is that in Lugari we have Mautuma Health Centre which has been built with the help of the Finnish Government, and it is located in an area where it can serve both Turbo Division in Uasin Gishu District and Tugoren Division of Bungoma. I wish to appeal to the Minister to use his wisdom and see to it that that health centre is upgraded to either a sub-district or a district hospital to serve that area. I also want to assure the Minister for Health that wealready have a committee functioning along the lines that the amendment suggests and that our people are doing all what is necessary. One of the things that we want to do on a Harambee basis is to fence this institution and employ some young men and women to help in cleaning this place so that it looks like a modern institution of public health.With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the Bill. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. Mwenje): Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to support this Bill. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, Kenya hjas reached a stage where if wehad not done most of our things through the Harambee basis, we would not havebeen where we are now. Harambee funds have not been budgeted but have been put into direct capital and have been able to uplift the standard of our country in many fields. I think it is in this spirit that this Bill seeks to leave hospitals and heal institutions to the people to have a say in their manangement. Previously, when health institutiuons were being run from the headquarters, people used to complain a lot because they would always require authority to do certain things. I think this is a very high sense of reasoning from the Minister for Health to let the wananchi in certain areas to have a say in the running and management of health institutions. Thepeople will now be free to run their health institutions the way they wish.THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. Mwenje) (CTD.)Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, what I would like to appeal to the Minister is that these committees should have access to the people in charge of either district hospitals or provincial hospitals so that whatever they will be facing can be solved quickly for the sake of wananchi. The committees cannot be wholly effective unless they have access to the senior officers who can get in touch with the permanent secretary, the director of medical services or the Minister himself. I think this is a very bright idea which is long overdue. It should have been there long time ago so that wananchi, instead of having to complain that the Government is not doing this or that to them, they have some committee which they can rely on. If we have to depend on the medical officers of health to over see all health institutions, then the situation becomes impossible. Those who are near the health institutions are in a better position to tell whether they are being served properly. Their complaints should be listened to by the Ministry immediately and acted on. There is no point of making them overseers yet you do not listen to them.Sir, maybe, the only small thing I would like to raise is that the Bill says there there will be no expenditure arising form-its implementation. But what I would like to suggest is that although the overseers may be volunteers, the Minister may, depending on finances available to him, consider paying the committee members some allowance. I think that would be good so that the commmittee members can feel that they are recognised. That would at least compensate them for fuel and any other expenses they may incur in serving the public. The payment does not have to be a salary.Once that is so, Sir, I would appeal to the Minister that some issues that we have been talking about seem to take a lot of time before they are implemented. The Ministry may not be directly involved, but even if some of these amttars are being handled by the Ministry agents such as the local authorities, steps should be taken to ensure that matters are speeded up. I think I have called about a dispensary in Dandora which was completed in 1984	THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. Mwenje) (CTD.)It is now over seven years when that health centre was completed and it has never been utilised despite the fact that all the necessary equipment is available.THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr.Mwenje) (CTD.)Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the equipment is already there but when we ask the City Commission why they have been unable to open the maternity they say they have no personnel. The Ministry should step in and solve the problem? There is no need of building an health centre and it takes seven years before it is becomes operational; This one in Dandora has taken too long; Public money was used to put up the buildings but the health centre is not serving the people. I do not know whether the Nairobi City Commission has any reason that they can give to Dandora residents as to why it has taken them seven years to open a maternity when the equipment is already there.There is another one in Kayole which has taken years to open.; it is complete but it has not been opened Why did the planners not think about personnel when they are planning the m construction of these health facilities? But you will find that they keep on telling us that they have no authority to recruit personnel and yet the facilities are ready. It is like cooking food and keeping it there, near somebody who is hungry and then you continue telling him, I have no authority to give you this food." Who will understand that? I appeal to the Ministry of Health to talk to the Nairobi City Commissions Department of Health to ensure that these two dispensaries which are ready are opened immediately. This is because the City Commission is unable to explain why it has taken so long to open these two dispensaries.THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MAKEETING (Mr.Mwenje) (CTD.)Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, at this juncture I would like to thank the Ministry of Health and particularly the Minister for Health for the action he has taken to combat the outbreaks of deadly diseases like cholera and plague here in Nairobi. Just recently there was an outbreak of plague in a certain mill in Embakasi. The outbreak was a result, of negligence on the part of some people. I thank the Ministry‚Äôs officials for the quick action they took. They saved a lot of lives I was there and I witnessed what they were doing and I would like to thank then for what they did. Although about three people died, the Ministry's officials acted quickly averted a calamity that was threatening the people who work in and live near that mill.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other issue that I would like touch on regards the drainage systems within the city. We have several sewerage leakages in the City. At this time when it is raining it is not easy to know the difference between the water from the sewerage system and rain water until you reach the Spot and get the foul smell.This is a real health hazard and I would appeal to the Ministry of Health to take up this matter with the Nairobi City Commission This is because these leakages are exposing our people to great danger. This is because if anybody steps accidentally into this murky water he may be infected; I therefore appeal to the City Commission to carryout thorough checks on the drainage system and sewerage system in the City to ensure that all leakages are stopped. The stagnant water from the sewerage and drainage system provides good breeding area for mosquitoes.THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES And MARKETING (Mr.Mwenje) (CTD.)Unless the drainage system is checked regularly the leakages will continue to expose our people to danger. We hope that the Nairobi City Commission will act quickly.The other issue that I have always been worried about is the National Hospital Insurance fund. I have never been satisfied that the N.H.I.P. has really been doing a good job. This is because the amount it continues to pay for in-patients is still far below what being charged by hospitals in this country. Since this is an insurance Fund, it is supposed to pay more than what we really contribute. I think something needs to be a done about this Fund. I think the Fund should assures itself with another larger insurance company so that they are able to meet whatever is spent in hospitals by patients. They should not depend on what they collect directly from the contributors. I say this because if an in-patient is charged KShs.900/- per day in a hospital and then the N.H.I.P. pays about KShs.150/- If you compare the difference, between the KShs.300/- and KShs.150/The patient is expected to meet the difference and yet he claims to be a member of an insurance scheme which is supposed to meet the cost on his behalf. This still remains unreasonable. The N.H.I.P. has not lived up to our expectations. It is not insurance Fund because it serves as a kind of direct payment So, I am saying that something needs to be done about the N.H.I.P. because it does not cover even one-quarter of what an in-patient pays. I would appeal to the Minister to look for way's and means of possibly re-investing or getting the N.E.I.P. covered by another insurance body so that the patient is assured that whatever expenses he incurs in hospital will be covered. In fact these days even if you tell the hospital authorities that you are a THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. Mwenje) (CTD.)member of the N.H. I.E. they tell you, Even if you are a member we still want to know whether you will be able to meet KShs.600/- per day. Although the intention of establishing N.H. I.F. was good the Fund has not covered what it was expected to cover.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have talked much about garbage collection in the City uncollected garbage continues to pose health hazards. There is a dumping site in Dandora which is causing a lot of problems to the residents of Dandora. If you go there you will see huge mountains of garbage. This refuse is supposed to be thrown in a quarry. when you go there you will see crows hovering the garbage heaps while at the same time there are human beings dig into the garbage looking for I do not know what. The smell from this garbage is a health hazard to people living in Dandora Phase I. when I went there and asked what was happening I was told that the tractor that is used to push the garbage into the ditch fell into the same ditch where the garbage is supposed to be thrown. That tractor is still there; it has never been removed. THE ASSISTANT MINISTER MARKETING AND SUPPLIES (Mr. Mwenje) (CTD.)As we talk here now, this tractor is in ditch, and it has been there for the last two or three months. Those concerned are not removing it. What the City Commission of Nairobi is contemplating to do is to buy another tractor although there is no guarantee that the new tractor will not go into the same ditch. This is serious and somebody somewhere has to tell us why this tractor has not been removed from the ditch. I am speaking the truth by saying that the tractor in question is in that particular ditch. The Commission wants to buy another tractor for Shs.3 million or Shs.4 million. This is pathetic, and something has to be done about it. Somebody has to direct the City Commission of Nairobi to make sure that this tractor is got out of that ditch. When you look at the Commission's minutes, you will see that the Commission has said that it is unable to remove that tractor from the ditch. The tractor has become a part of the garbage there.This garbage is not being collected or pushed properly into the ditch. Instead, it is somewhere up, and its smell continues to expose the people living, in Dandora Phase I to a health hazard. Something has to be done about this matter because we cannot continue living with garbage around them as if they were not human beings. I appeal to the Minister for Health to use any law under his command even if it means stopping the dumping of garbage in that particular areas in order to ensure that things here are done properly. I call upon the Minister himself to visit this place with the Director of Medical Services and see how people are living in the area. The residents of the place continue to complain, but nobody seems to hear them. This is a serious issue, and I hope that those concerned will take immediate action.We have a bit plot reserved for Nyayo Wards in Embakasi, but nothing has been done about it up to now. I appeal to the Minister to take action. We are even prepared to hold a Harambee funds drive, and the Ministry should, at least, provide us with the necessary drawings, and so on. Nairobi District Development Committee has already passed the construction of these wards and all that now remains is for the Ministry to give us the necessary advice. If thisTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR MARKETING AND SUPPLIES (Mr. Mwenje) (CTD.)takes too long to do, something else more needy might come up and interfere with our plans. So, I appeal to the Ministry to make use of the plot before it falls into other needy hands.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I urge the Minister for Health to come up with an Act of Parliament that requires every institution to have first aid facilities. If we had first aid kits in our institutions, they would cater for those who fall sick suddenly. Apart from vehicles and a few houses, you fill find that most institutions do not have first aid kits. I think it is time the Minister brought up law to require all public institutions to have first aid kits so that if anybody falls sick suddenly, it may be possible to attend to him even before he is taken to hospital. Many people die before they get to hospital because they do not get first aid even to stop a wound from bleeding.THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR MARKETING AND SUPPLIES (Mr. Mwenje) (CTD.)If there were first-aid kits in all public institutions, that would help a lot. I think the time has come when the Minister for Health should bring a Bill to the House to make it mandatory for such provision in all the health institutions. We will pass such a Bill so that somebody, can be punished for not having first-aid kits. However, as of now, it has been left to everybody to do what he wishes to do at his own will and this is only to be seen in public vehicles.The reason why we have so many cases of health hazards in shanties is as a result of lack of water in such areas. I think it is necessary to provide water to even kiosks. One fact is that kiosks are here to stay; we have areas where kiosks must be there. We have the Industrial Area here and most of the workers cannot afford to eat in hotels. For that reason, they must be supplied with water, through the kiosks, they eat in. I call upon the Nairobi City Commission to provide these people with water, even if that will be done for some minimum charge.Those people living in the shanties, and who we have not been able to settle anywhere else, should also be provided with water and toilets. When we see plagues like Cholera and so on, this is caused by such lack of toilets in these shanty areas. If the local authorities are not properly addressing themselves to this sensitive issue, the Minister for Health should invoke the Act to ensure that these areas are provided with water and toilets. If we do not provide such services, and Cholera cases are reported, we will not be able to efficiently combat such a disease.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, some of the people in these shanties were born and raised in the same shanties and, therefore, there is nothing one can do other than provide them with the necessary facilities like water and toilets. The time is long gone when we used to be told that local authorities do not have sufficient funds. They now have the services charge. It is good that they have been told by none other than by His Excellency the President.THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR MARKETING AND SUPPLIES (Mr. Mwenje) (CTD.)himself that they must justify the amounts they are collecting from the public. The money should be seen to be serving the same public. So, we expect the local authorities to be efficient. I am glad that some of the local authorities have started publishing their budgets, but we are as yet to see the Nairobi City Commission's budget being publicised. We are as yet to see what the budget has done.Sir, we need to see something being done about this lower category of our people who live in shanties. They are there and they are our people who are working and paying whatever little amount in form of services charge to the Commission. They also, therefore, require these essential services I have mentioned, namely water and toilets, and they should be provided with them.There is another point on which we are still awaiting a statement from the Minister for Health. This is about the traditional medicine. The traditional medicine in this country seems to be on the increase and we have traditional herbalists who seem to be doing a good service. However, members of public have never been assured on whether these herbalists are genuine or whether they are witch doctors, or whatever they should be considered to be. We need the advice of the Ministry of Health so that we can know a little bit more of the traditional herbalists. Now that we have the Kenya Medical Research Institute, the researchers there should be able to determine whether what the herbalists are dispensing is as claimed, so that they can advise us on whether the drugs are fit to be used or not. </NEWSPEECH><HEADER>ADJOURNMENT</HEADER><NEWSPEECH>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Kagwima): Hon.
