H A N S A R DWednesday, 16th December, 1987The House met at Nine o'clock.The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Karauri) in the ChairPRAYERS <Header>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</Header> Question No. 776<Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Karauri): Dr. Omajno is not yet here?</Newspeech> Question No. 744 <Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Karauri): Mr. Muthura has not come. Mr. Ekidor’s Question.Mr. EKIDOR asked the Minister for Commerce whether he could tell the House how much a bag of sugar costs in the K.N.T.C. Depot at Lodwar.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR COMMERCE (Mr. Kiraemia): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. I wish to inform the House that the current price of sugar at the Kenya National Trading Corporation (K.N.T.C.) Deport at Lodwar is Sh.8l8.O5 per 100 kilogramme bag.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, when the President of this Republic visited Turkana District early this year he directed that a KK K.N.T.C. Depot be opened in Lodwar, and that wananchi be sold sugar for less than Sh.800 per bag. Now, can the Assistant Minister tell this House Bills Ministry is violating the directive of the President?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KTMETIA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we still have plans for opening a K.N.T.C. branch at Lodwar. So, we are still in the process of doing that.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the K.N.T.C. has a branch in Lodwar, but it is overchargeng wananchq despite the President's directive that wananchi should be sold sugar for less than Sh.800/ per bag. The K.N.T.C. branch is already there, but wananchi are being exploited through overcharging. Can he tell the House why this is the case?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KJMEMIA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the controlled price or sugar does not include the cost of transportation. Therefore, all those K.H.T.C. depots within reach of railway transport have the same price, while those depots which are far from easy reach have varied prices due to the mode of transport used. So, the price, of sugar in Kapennguria is Sh.746.05 per 100 kilogramme bag, while in Maralal the price is Sh.786/- per 100 kilogramme bag.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: Arising from that reply, the Assistant Minister has not replied to the supplementary question of the hon. Member to the effect that there was a directive, What happened, to it? Did he ever hear of that directive? If he so what has he done to implement that directive?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KIMEMIA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in my reply I mentioned here that where there is railway transport the prices are the same; but if there is not  railway transport facility, they must charge a higher price because of the costs of transportation.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SEIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister has not replied to the supplementary question, namely9 that the President gave a directive that the price should be lowered, what happened to it? Is he telling the House that if there was a railway line to the area they would have implemented it, and that since there is no railway line to Lodwar wananchi must be overcharged? What what action did he take to reduce the price as per the directive.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR KIMEMIA: Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have said that the price of sugar is controlled. But if the President directed that, I shall look into that.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is It in order for the Assistant Minister to try to evade the question? The question U is that a directive was given. Now, he is telling us that he has e never heard of it by saying "If the President...... It is a statement of fact that he did give the directive. Could he go back and find out if that is in record, then come come back? and give a proper reply. This is because the directive was given. Even those of us who were not in Lodwar know it because we heard it over the radio. How can the Assistant Minister sit here not knowing what the President has said.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KlT.n3.iIA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will look into it.</Newspeech><Newspeech>ME. arap BOMUST: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, since sugar is an essential commodity, and since K.N.T.C. cells to other areas where they make profit, could they not restructure prices so that outlying districts "like Turkana and others are not penalised? They should pay the same price as other districts.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIMEMIA: Yes, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, I do agree with that. But we also do not want to penalise the transporters. This is because the K.N.T.C. also want to make a profit.</Newspeech>Question No. 13b.'JSR7' FAKIONDO asked' the. Minister for Labour:- ':9a) whether he is aware that Mr. Josphat J. Kithetu, a former trainee at Marimanti Yoiith Polytechnic, sat for a trade test as Mason Grade III on 20.8.80 and up to date the result has never been released; and(b) whether he could explain the reasons why Mr. Kithetu has never received his results up to now, as per appointment for Trade Test letter of 17th July, 1980 <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. arap KETTO): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, i I beg to reply.(aj I am not aware that Mr. Josephat J. Kithetu who sat for Trade Test as a Mason Grade III on 20th August, 1980 has never £ received his results to date.(b) According to the available records, a person in the name of JosephatJ. Kithetu,, sat for a Trade Testing Examination in 'Nairobi for Grade III in m?-nsmmasonry on 20th August, 1980. The record shows that Josephat J. Kithetu was at the material time a trainee candidate from Marimanti Craft Training Centre in Meru, to which the appointment for Trade Testing letter of 17th July, 1980 was addressed in the same name. The record also shows that he had a "pass" in the results dated 7th January, 1981. But the record does not show any subsequent written complaint or otherwise from either Josephat J. Kithetu or Marimanti Craft Training Centre for non-receipt of the "result" of the examination.	. . ..The record does not, however, show any true copy of an rdcirtrjr9c&d or passpor sisc photograph which are both mandatory requirements for the issue of both results and certificate. This may have delayed the release of Mr. Kithetufs results among</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr.ara Metto)(CTD):other results of about 30,000 candidates who sat Trade Tests in that year.The matter is already receiving serious and urgent attention and the said Josephat J. Kithetu is being traced to establish what may have happened. If the hon. Member Knows where Mr. Kithetu is, he should tell him to report to the Director of Industrial Training, Nairobi, as soon as possible so that his certificate may be issued to him upon identification.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAKIONDO: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the Assistant Minister for the reply he has given. I will notify the boy because he is at home. Thank you very much.</Newspeech> Question No. 787MR. MUIA asked the Minister for Transport and Communications: -(a) if he is aware that the section of Road C99 between Machakos Town and Wote Market was  approved by the Machacos D.D.C. for tarmacking some years ago; and(b) what has delayed the tarmacking of the road.<Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Karauri): Anyone from the Ministry of Transport, and Communications? None. Next Question, Mr. Ndza</Newspeech>Question No. 792 MR. NDZAI asked the Minister for Transport and Communications:-(a)	what has delayed the refund of KSh.1675/40 to Mr. Harrison Charo W/P 7188, P/No.138326 as per letter Ref.ACC/K/470/21 of 21st December, 1980,from the Provincial Engineer, Box 90663, Mombasa; and(b)	if he could arrange to pay him as soon as possible. <Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr.Karauri): Anyone from theMinistry of Transport and Communications?None. Next Question, Mr.Shik</Newspeech>Question No.800MR. SHIKUKU asked the Minister for Culture andSocial Services(a) how many people are handicapped in Butere Constituency and how many of them have been employed in Government service;(b) how many of these handicapped people have benefitted from the National Fund for the disabled; and(g) if he will consider setting up divisional, district and provincial rehabilitation committees to process and manage the affairs of the handicapped<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES  (Mrs. Ogot)  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(a)	It is not possible to establish how many people are handicapped in But ere Constituency since there has not been any census for the disabled persons conducted in Kenya. Similarly, it is not easyt O' determine how many handicapped persons from Butere Constituency have been employed in the Government Service because the opportunities for employment are open to all Kenyans who meet the required qualifications and requirements and records of employees do not distinguish those who are handicapped from those who are not, or those who come from any particular constituency.(b)	The National Fund for the Disabled of Kenya does not assist individual disabled persons directly. The Fund channels its donations to the institutions catering for the disabled people which apply to it for merit assistance. On this basis, to the extent that there is not any institution catering for the disabled people within Butere Constituency, it is not, therefore, possible for the Fund to reach out the disabled people in that area.(c)	In Kakamega District, a District Rehabilitation Committee was established in 1986 with the District Commissioner as the Chairman and the District Social Development Officer as the Secretary. Division Rehabilitation Committees have also been, or are in the process of being established. In Butere Constituency which is composed of two Administrative Divisions, namely, Khwisero and Butere, there is one Divisional Rehabilitation Committee for Khwisero Division. The Distric Officer is the Chairman, and the Manager of Khwisero Youth Polytechnic is the Secretary. The Divisional Rehabilitation Committee for Butere has not been established yet, but it is under consideration.This arrangement, Sir, is in line with the District Focus for Rural Development Policy which, aims to involve the people at the locallevel who are the beneficiaries of the National Development Program</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES (Mrs. Ogot) (Contact in identifying their needs and priorities, including, the rehabilitation of the disabled people for gainful employment. The Provincial Rehabilitation Committee suggested by the hon. Member is not a priority.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: Arising from that reply, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, which in my opinion is not very encouraging, in part (a) of the Question, the hon. Lady says that they have not conducted a census to know how many disabled people are there in Kenya. will she tell the House when she will or the Ministry conduct a census for every part of Kenya, starting with Butere and elsewhere, so that we actually know how many people are disabled in various parts of Kenya?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: As soon as possible! MR. SHIKUKU: "As soon as possible"! Thank you.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MRS. OGOT: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, hon. Shilcuku  know as much as I do that we are trying as much as possible to integrate the disabled people and not to make them feel that they are different from other members of the community. In order to assist us, as a Ministry, to plan for the disabled people</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MATE: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Si Is taking census disintegrating' the people? I think taking census is quite different from integrating; the disabled from the able-bodied persons. So, why is the Assistant Minister confusing the two issues?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MRS. OGOT: No, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I am not confusing the two issues. I am speaking on an area where I have a lot of experience and The fact census for the disabled persons, counting the cripples and so on, we to be will make them very much aware of their disability, or of their being different from other Kenyans, particularly within families.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: No! No! No!</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MRS. OGOT: Oh, yes. However, we have some guidelines based on United Nations (U.N.) arrangements where we just do the estimation.For example, like in Butere where we have a population of about 120,000 people, as we were debating in the House recently, we use some rough figures from U.N. Information and United Nations International Children's Educational Fund (U.N.I.C.E.F.). We say that there would be between 8 and 10 per cent of disabled persons in Butere although Kenyans have always felt that that is a very high percentage. However, because hon. Shikuku has now asked the Question, it will not be a bad idea for the Ministry to think along those lines, if it will not hurt the disabled persons.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUIA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, arising from that reply given by the Assistant Minister, is it not misleading the House to say that the census relied on by the Kenya Government is based on figures and information supplied by the U.N. and U.N.I.C.E.F, etcetera When we know that when we know that it is the other way round? We know that some of the information with the U.N. organisations or bodies come from the Government itself.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MRS. OGOT: Of course, when I mentioned the U.N. and U.N.I.C.E.FI am sure the hon. Member is aware that Kenya is part and parcel these areInternational bodies. Also, the researches that are often done either by the U.N. or U.N.I.C.E.F. agencies in Kenya, the Kenya Government is part and parcel of that report. But when quoting a footnote, it is also good to quote the source.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUIA: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Si If that is the case, why can the Kenya Government or the Ministry of Culture and Social Services not produce proper figures instead, of saying that it is not proper to conduct a census to know exactly how man disabled people are in Butere?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Karauri): I am sorry, that is not a point of order.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: Arising out of the point of order which has just been raised by the lion. Member should have been a supplementary question. However to  be able to help and plan, we must know how many people we have in order to be able to help them. If we do not keep census, or if we do not find out through some other ways to know how many they arc, the Assistant Minister knows very well that we cannot be able to help them. That is why it is high time and I am glad she has accepted that they looked at this problem so that we can know how many disabled persons we have in Butere, Kitui, Mbooni and other places.However, in part (b) of the Question, the.hon. Lady says that the National Fund for the Disabled in Kenya does not assist individual but channels its assistance through institutions. Now, I would like to know how much was channelled and to which institutions from the National Fund for the Disabled of Kenya? I would like to know how much was channelled to Kakamega and how much went to Butere?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MRS. OGOT: Before I give an answer to that question,Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I just wanted to mention tohon. Shikuku on his other supplementary question that he is aware because we were debating this the other day that figures of the World Health Organization which Kenya like any other country uses since they are part and parcel of the World Health Organization, relate to the 10 per cent of the population. So in Butere, if the population is 126,000 people, it is estimated that about 12,000 people are disabled and unless we are pressed we usually do not use those figures but we use them on planning. On the second question as to how much money went to the hon. Member's Constituency, I can give the figures immediately and that the Kakamega Rural Educational Rehabilitation Centre got Sh.25,000/= x directly from the fund last year.As for Butere and as I had mentioned, khwisso Division, is benefiting because the centre has already been established. What we will do now that the hon. Member has asked is to find out and process when Butere will also have its own rehabilitation centre so that it can be funded directly.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ANGATIA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the  Assistant Minister give has very useful information to say that she will find out on the lines proposed by the Questioner as to how many disabled people are in the country. I thought this would- be a. priority matter. The Assistant Minister seems to be afraid that if the disabled people are singled out and counted, they will feel ac bad. But, the disabled in people to be known; we all want to know where they are so that we can assist them. The Ministry should not appear to be hesitant to find the number of these people. In fact, they should not just findhe disabled people, they should also find out the extent of disability of each disabled person. Can she assure as that she will go beyond knowing the number of the disabled people who are there in the country, but also to know the extent of disability in every area and let all of us know so that we may know how to help them and how to integrate them in society?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MRS. OGOT: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is not any country in the world that has taken a lot of pains to take care of the of the  its own disabled people as Kenya has. Apart from the National Trust Fund, which has been spearheaded by His Excellency the President, and chaired by an hon. Member of this House Dr. Gecaga  which gives out money every year It was originally given to the Provinces but now, it is given to the Districts. There is no country which is planning as Kenya has done and within my Ministr3r, the rehabilitation committee under the Ministry, which has its own executive committee and management, donates money out money to the 42 districts - that is 4-1 districts plus Nairobi. Also, planning by using the World Health Organization figures - which Kenya is part and parcel Kenya Government is planning extensively on the disabled9©- many rehabilitation centres. That is why & when hon. Shikuku asked a Question on Butere, I took the Question sympathetically, that Butere should also have a rehabilitation centre, and that we are going to make all efforts to have one in Butere. MR. MUTISO: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I am just seeking your guidance. I need some clarification in order to understand the Question "whether the terminology used by the hon. Member here "handicapped" is justthe same as the term "disabled" as is being used in the answer?I believe that the term "handicapped" embraces a wider area forthe people who are disabled. Therefore, is it the same, andwould the answer for a question on handicapped people be the same as that disabled people?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Karauri): Yes; next Question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ANGATIA: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy-Speaker, Sir. I do not know whether you realized that the Assistant Minister did not answer any part of my question at all? I am simply seeking an assurance from her that we will locate where these disabled people are and find out the extent of their disability and the nature of disability in order that help may be channeled acurately. She is saying that Kenya has done very well. we are grateful for we know that Kenya has done very well, but if the Ministry has channelled money to Kakamega District, to whom was it channelled? Money may have been channelled but it may have gone to abled bodied people and not to any disabled person. If she does not know where they are, how they are disabled and wkat the nature of their disability is, how has she channelled money to Kakamega or to any district for that matter?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MRS. OGOT: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in Kakamega alone, because it is the districts which Please, give me time. In  Kakamega alone, the institutions of disabled persons. which have received substantial funding are as follows:-Mumias Production Workshopfor the Disabled.....................Sh.50,000/=Mumias Secondary School forthe Deaf.............................Sh.50,000/=Mumias Shelter Workshop.'.............Sh.25,000/=Kakamega Rural VocationalCentre...............................Sh.25,000/=Itendo Vocational Rehabilitation Centre...............................Sh. 25,000/-.Mumias Primary School for theDeaf.................................Sh.65,000/=Mumias Shelter Workshop forDeaf Girls..........................Sh.50,000/=The list is extensive, but all those areas are places where we have identified the disabled people and their disabilities and given the funds correctly.</Newspeech>(applause) <Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Karauri): Order I That Question has been answered sufficiently Next Question. Question No.762 MR. arap KOSKE asked the Minister for Health: (a) whether he is aware that a Mr. John Kipkemoi Koros, of P.O. Box 11, Eericho, a former employee of Kericho District Hospital was suspended on 30th September, 1986, and subsequently dismissed;(b) why he was dismissed; and(c) whether he was given any benefits.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Matiba): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I "beg to reply.(a) I am aware that Mr. John Kipkemoi was dismissed from the Service in September, 1986.(b) Mr. Kipkemoi was a casual worker, performing the duties of a watchman. On the night of 25th September1986, lie lured a woman patient into the Outpatient Department Examination Room .and had sex with her. That is why he was dismissed.(c) As a casual worker, he was not eligible for any benefits</Newspeech> (laughter) <Newspeech>MR. arap KOSKE: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, arising from the answer given by the Minister, is he not really misleading the House by bringing the affair of sex here when I have got the official letter - KER/ST/C.W./lOO B/869 - of 30th September, 1986 saying that this person was laid off because of suspected drunkenness and malicious damage Government property? There is nothing about a sex affair mentioned here. Can he give us the real reason because this is an official letter?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MATIBA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, all those have been an addition to what he had done. MR. arap KOSKE: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, can the Minister repeat what he said? I did not hear.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MATIBA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, what I said is that what the hon. Member might be having in that letter is in addition to what this gentleman had done, which was totally disgraceful.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. arap KOSKE: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Karauri):  Order, Mr. arap Koske In any case if you knew the answer to the Question you should not have asked it. let us go back to Dr. Omamo's Question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ABUYA-ABUYA: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. In view of the seriousness of the case, as per the Minister's reply, would he Since this person behaved like a beast would the Minister take steps to ensure that this fellow goes to court?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Karauri): That is not a point of order. Let us go back to Dr. Omamo's Question.</Newspeech>Question No.776 <Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Karauri): Dr. Omamo still not here?</Newspeech> Mr. Muthura's Question.Question No.744 <Newspeech>MR. WAKIANDO, on behalf of Mr. Muthura, asked the Minister for Co-operative Development what the Ministry is doing to revive the dormant co-operative societies in Laikipia District in relation to the reply to Question No.608 given on 22nd October, 1987.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE.TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER(Mr. Karauri): Anybody from Ministry of Co-operative Development? Let us go to Mr Muia's Question.</Newspeech>MR MUIA asked the Minister for Transport and Communications:-(a)	whether he is aware that the section of Road C99 between Machakos Town and Vote Market was approved by the Maehakos D.D.C for tarmacking some years ago; and(b)	what has delayed the tarmacking of the road.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Keriri): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, first of all I apologise for not being in the House when this Question was first called. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply, (a) I am aware that in its meeting of December, 1985, the Maehakos D.D.C. recommended, among other projects, the tarmacking of the section of Road C99 between Maehakos Town and Wote Market.( b) Lack of funds has caused the delay in tarmacking of this road However, the. Ministry of Transport and Communications will continue liaising with the Ministry of Finance for the purpose of identifying suitable source of funding for this project, along with others which have similar problems.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUIA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, arising from that reply from the Assistant Minister and which I think is proper First of all I want to disagree with the Assistant Minister and tell him that the Maehakos D.D.C. did not recommend this road for tarmacking in 1985. The recommendation was made in the 1970s. I can provide that Minute to the Assistant Minister if he wishes to see it. The recommendation was made in the late 1970s. Secondly, if the Minister for Transport and Communications is still liaising with the Minister for Finance, the year 1981</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Karauri): Order I Ask your supplementary question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUIA: If I may ask my first supplementary question, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, is the Assistant Minister aware that recommendations by the Machakos D.D.C. were made in the 1970s and early 1980? I have Minutes to prove that. Is the Assistant Minister also aware that in the year 1981, the Ministry of Finance wrote to the Ministry of Transport and Communications about this particular road? I had a copy of that letter and I gave it to the current Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Transport and Communications.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Karauri): Order  You are making a speech. You are not asking any questions.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUIA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, why is the Assistant Minister saying that they are still liaising with the Ministry of Finance when the Ministry of Finance, in 1981, said it could identify funds for this project?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KERIRI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not understand what the hon. Member means by saying that the Machakos D.D.C. recommended this road for tarmacking in the 1970s. This is because the District Focus for Rural Development Strategy had not been introduced I do not know what kind of D.D.C.it was. Anyway, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am not aware of the letter the hon. Member is referring to.' But the letter might be useful to us in the Ministry. Even if that letter existed it would not make much difference. This is because there many projects which await implementation We have been liaising. with the Ministry of Finance to make funds available for the implementation of these projects. We are not thinking about this particular project alone. If the money is not available thereis nothing we can do. We can only do something if money "becomes available. So, we shall continue to liaise with the Treasury. I cannot give an answer while we are liaising with the Treasury over this matter. We are liaising with the Treasury to find money to tarmac the road.</Newspeech> MR. MUNYAO: MR Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not understand what the Assistant Minister means when he says that the Strategy District Focus for Rural Development was not there in the 1970s. Maybe it was not there, but the District Development Committees were there to initiate development projects in the districts. Could the Assistant Minister tell the House when he intends to he forward these proposals to the Ministry of Finance? Will he do so during the 1987/88 and 1988/89 financial years?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KERIRI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, discussions on Development Estimates are carried out between the Treasury and Ministry of Transport and Communications and other Ministries regularly. We will not only tarmack this road but we will include other roads. This road and others were included in the Forward Budget, but there was no money to include them in the Budget proper. But we always include these roads in the Forward Budget and if the money is not available we leave them out.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Karauri): Mr. Ndzai’S Question'</Newspeech>MR. NDZAI asked the Minister for Transport andCommunications:(a) what has delayed the refund of KShs.l,675.40 to Mir. Harrison Charo W/F 7188, P/No.138326 as per letter Ref. ACC/K/470/21 of 21st December, 1980, from the Provincial Engineer, Box 90663, Mombasa; and(b) whether he could arrange to pay him as soon as possible. <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Keriri): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, once again I beg to apologise for not being in the Chamber when this Question was called.I was just entering the Chamber when the Question was asked.Having said that, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(a) Mr. Harrison Charo as a works paid employee in the Ministry was on the manual payroll of the Provincial Engineer. The delay in refunding him his KShs.1,066,60 but not KShs.1,675.40, has been due to an oversight which is greatly regretted®'(b)	A payment voucher has now been prepared in the name of Mr. Harrison Charo for the refund of the money and he should be receiving a cheque for the same amount before the end of this month.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NDZAI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister tell the House when the payment voucher was prepared? Could he give us the date when it was prepared?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KERIRI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am sorry I cannot give the hon. Member and the House the exact date when the payment voucher was prepared.

ABUYA-ABUYA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I "beg to ask the Minister of State, Office of the President, the following Question by Private Notice. (a) Is the Minister aware that the late widow Sabina Nyabinda Nyakwama of Magogo Village, Kemera Sub-location, Kitutu East, died of severe beatings inflicted on her by youth wingers led by the Assistant Chief of Bogetaorio Sub-location?(b) what urgent steps is he taking to have those involved in this heinous act brought to book?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Onyancha): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. I am not aware that the late Sabina Nyabinda Nyakwama died as a result of severe beatings inflicted on her by youth wingers led by the Assistant Chief of Bogetaorio Sub-location.On 15th September, 1987, at 6.00 p.m.the Assistant Chief of Bogetaorio Sub-location, Mr. Andrew Osebe, accompanied by a group of Kami youth wingers were on raid within the area looking forillegal brews of busaa and chang'aa. At about 8.15 p.m. they went to the House of Sabina Nyabinda Nyakwama who was present with her two children namely, Joyce Kemto and Cecilia Kwamboka, aged 17 and 14 years respectively. A treetop bottle full of chang'aa and a plastic jerry can with some chang'aa were found in the House. Sabina "Nyabinda, who was aged about 42 years, looked very drunk and she was staggering when she was being questioned about the chang'aa. The Assistant Chief his party took possession of the chang'aa and asked the lady to report to the Assistant Chief's office the following day. Before the party went to the House of the late Sabina Nyabinda, two other ladies had also been arrested for be.ing in possession of busaa. They were also released and asked to report to the Assistant Chief the following day.That same night on the 15th September, 1987, after the assistant chief and his party had left, the two daughters noted that their mother had difficulties in breathing. They went and informed their elder brother, Juvenal is Mojianyi who was out of the hou.se when the assistant chief and the party were in the house. In the morning of the 16th September,5 1987, the condition of the lady Sabina had deteriorated,when the children called their uncle, Thomas Matoke, who also lived within the neighbourhood. She was rushed to Tabaka Mission Hospital unconscious where she wa3 admitted for treatment. Since she could not talk, her problem could not be easily diagnised On  17th September1987at 6.00 pm. she dies while under-going treatment at the hospital.The matter was referred to Kisii Police Station, and the dead body which had no visible injuries was moved to Kisii District Mortuary for post-mortem. The doctor who performed the post-mortem examination on the 18th September/ 1987 formed his opinion that the cause of death was cardial respiratory arrest whose basic cause could not be ascertained from gross physical condition of the lady.A police inquest file has been opened - No.73/87  and investigations are in progress. This Question raises quite serious implications of the matter, and we want thorough investigations to be done. This is actually being done now. I would like only to take this opportunity to request my colleague, hon. Abuya-Abuya, to help us, if he has got any information that can help us to find the truth of the matter. For example,if he knows of some individuals who have any evidence he should request them to go to the police station and record their statements so that the magistrate could be in a position to arrive at a fair judgement. If it is finally found that these allegations are true then proper steps would be taken according to the law of this country.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ABUYA-ABUYA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Assistant Minister for trying to answer this Question. I will do my best to avail those who were present during this unfortunate incident. Will be also, on his part, ensure that there will be no cover-up by the administration particularly since the assistant chief is involved?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to give that kind of assurance.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KAHIEDO: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Would the Assistant Minister tell the House whether the inquest file was opened after the hon. Member had brought the Question to the House or whether it was opened much earlier?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker Sir, I am not very sure about that particular fact. What I am aware of right now is that an inquest file was opened." Some statements have already been taken and that is why I made the appeal that if there are any other people who have any information that can help us to find the truth to come forward and make statements to the police.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Karauri): Let us move on to Mr. "Gachanja's Question by Private Notice.</Newspeech>(MR. GACHANJA) to ask the Minister for Local Government:-(a)	Is the Minister aware that there is a possible out-break of dangerous diseases at Kangemi Health Centre due to lack of proper sanitary facilities at the Health centre?(b)	What action is he taking to ensure that these facilities are provided?<Newspeech>MR.

MUKYAO; Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I "beg to ask the Minister for Lands and Settlement the following Question "by Private Notice.(a) Is the Minister aware that plot parcel Wamunyu/ Kwakala l80 in Wamunyu location has been sub-divided into three parcels?(b) Is he further aware that one of the family membersis selling the third piece of land to an outsider without the concent of the other family members?(c) Can the Minister take urgent action to stop this private sale?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LANDS AND SETTLEMENT (Mr. Nyakiamo): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(a) I am aware that an application for the sub-divisionfbT'hcw.S of the plot parcel No. Wamunyu/£wakala/l80 into three "pr&censj- was ajnpzB approved by the divisional: land control boards the plot has already been sub-divided into two portions.(b) I am not aware that a third portion of the plot is being sold by  a member of the family without the consent of the other family members.	(c) The family members who are against any proposed the land or a third portion of the land may present their grievances to the division land control board who will in comformity with the current Government policy demand the presence of all members of the family and consider their objections before making a decision. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I want to make a clarification here although an approval was given for the divison of land into three portions, so far has only been divided into two portion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUNYAO: Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister was totally misled. I have a copy of the title-deed which I am talking about. I have also given the Minister a copy of these documents which I am holding and which contain information showing that the land has been sub-divided into three parcels. Why is the Minister misleading the House that this particular plot-has not been sub-divided into three parcels when authority had been given by the division land control board? That is not true.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. NYAKIAMO: Mr." Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have not seen the information which the hon. Member says he has given to me. I agree that it might have been passed on to my officials.The information that I got yesterday and today is that although the approval for the sub-division of the plot into three parcels was given so far only two have been sub-divided.I am prepared to receive any further information from the hon. Member to enable me to investigate this matter further. This morning, I even said that I was not satisfied with all the information that I got and I have asked for more information."</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MHNYAO:  Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister has misled the House even further. This is because in the last one or two weeks when the Minister was replying to a Motion here, he sent hon. Muturia who is his Assistant Minister to come and collect the information that I am talking about from me. I informed him that the land was to be sub-divided into three parcels. Why is the Minister still misleading the House? I am insisting on this one, so that I can give us the facts.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NYAKIAM0: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker Sir," I am trying to be very truthful. The more giving of permission for sub-division of the land into three portions does not necessarily mean that has already been done. I have said that I am quite prepared to receive further information on the matter. I do also agree that hon. Munyao passed on the information to my people, as I had requested him to do. It is on the strength of that information that we are asking for further information.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not like the idea of an hon. Member saying that I am misleading the House because I am trying my best to give him the truths.</Newspeech>(applause)<Newspeech>MR. SIFUNA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Information and Broadcasting the following Question by Private Notice.(a)	Who was given the tender for supply of electronic values for Radio and Television Transmitters as per the authority given by Treasury, letter Ref. No, AFN.720/42/01/51 dated 3rd February, 1987 in response to the Ministry's letter Ref. No. MID 9/11/252 dated 6th January 1987?(b)	How much did it cost the Government for the purchase of four valves type TH 521 that were bought in May June 1987?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Khasakhala): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir; I beg to reply.(a)	Local Purchase Order (LPO) No. 838549 dated 8th April, 1987 was issued to Kenya Auto Electrict Limited, P.O, Box 46631, Nairobi.(b)	The total cost for four valves was Kshs. 1,580,000/</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SIFUNA: The answer given by the Assistant Minister is very mis¬leading. According to the information and documents I have here, the PermanentSecretary in the Ministry of Finance gave the authority to the Ministry ofInformation and Broadcasting to order these four valves directly from the overseasmanufacturers. After the Director of Information and Broadcasting got		this authority from Treasury, he refused to order directly from the said manufacturersbut purchased them locally. I can quote his letter which"The known- price of valves procured from manufacturers and actual prices quoted and paid for orders with the local firm e.g. valve type TH521 whose price if procured_from manufacturers is Kshs. 262,230/- for four valves as underlined on the attached list Ref, No, VOK/ENG/s/55; as opposed to the price paid to the local company of Kshs. 1,580,000/- vide Invoice No. 4758 of 24/6/87Therefore, this shows that the Director of Information and Broadcastingswindled the Kenya Government Kshs  1,317,770/- Can the Assistant Minister .tell us why they refused to buy directly as previously agreed? They went? and		bought these valves locally so that they could be able to yet more than 80 per centcommission a that is Kshs.317,770/-.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KHASAKHALA: Sir, that is a one sided question because the details the hon0 Member is referring to can only be verified by going through the documents which I have here0 The facts of this matter is that we were preparing for the Fourth All African Games which were due to be held here and most of our stations were not in working order because most of the valves had blown off and, therefore, we wanted to get valves very, urgently. In view of that fact, an open Tender No 12/86-87 was advertised, and the valves TH521 were awarded to Messrs, Berk Enterprises at the unit price of Kshs. 190,000/- When LPO was issued to them, they returned it and said that their prices had gone up to Kshs.422,255/- per valvesThe matter was then referred to the Central Tender Board (CTB) which § approved Messrs, Kenya Auto Electricals to supply the same valves at Kshs.225, 843/- each. Again when ± an LPO was issued to Messrs Kenya A Electricals, they also wrote back and said that their price is had also gone up to Kshso395,000/- for each valve.</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: Where is the evidence?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KHASAKHALA: The letters are attached; I have got them with me. At this stage the price validity period for the subject tender had expired and hence the Central Tender Board was requested to approve re-validation of prices from all the tender so I have those particular copies®We went ahead and ordered the same from the local approved representative Messrs? Kenya Auto Electrical at their new prices of Kshs.395,000/- which then totalled to Kshs.1,580,000/-We had gone through all required systems and authority was given to us to buy these valves.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIKIYU: Sir, arising from that lengthy explanation from the Assistant Minister, can he tell the House how in one weak there was such a big variation in prices such that the prices of these items trebled? And due to these variations, were these items re-tendered to check whether there were other Kenyans prepared to supply them at lower prices?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR, KHASAKHALA: We had checked with the manufacturers to find out thecheapest way of getting the valves, and that is how we awarded the tenders.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. KIKUYU: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. My question is very clear and I do not know why the Assistant Minister wants to avoid it. In the first instance there was the normal tendering, A few manufacturers connived together and offered prices which they would 3: change later In fact, they later changed the prices and the Ministry agreed with them, I am asking the Assistant Minister why he did not cancel  that, tender after it had gone through all the difficult cheatings and re-tender to find out whether there was any other company in the Republic which could offer these items at lower prices than offered by those companies which had already tendered and later on varying the prices?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KHASAKHALA: The information being given by the hon. Member regarding local manufacturers having colluded together to raise the prices is outside our knowledge, because we do not know whether they did that or not0 The fact is that we needed these valves for the Fourth All African Games urgently and we were running out of time. We should congratulate the Ministry for what it did during the games.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: No! No!</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KHSAKHALA: The stations could not broadcast the games live without these valves and they had to be brought in order to make it successful.(There was a lot of noise in the Chamber) We could not wait to be instructed by others people when we knew that we wanted to succeed. So, we had to do it.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SIFUNA: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. The hon. Assistant Minister is misleading the House and I wonder whether they shared this money or not. The information we have here is that they were preparing for the Fourth All African Games and that is why the Treasury gave them authority to purchase directly from Thomson CSF through their normal agent here and they were given that particular price which I quoted. The Director of Information and 8ra Broadcasting deliberately refused and placed the order with another company which made us suffer a loss of more than Kshs. 1.3 million. Is he in order to mislead this House whey shared that loot?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KHASAKHALA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am one man who can never "be named under any circumstances on corruption. I am as clean as I am, and as I am standing here. The fact of the matter is that the persons who supplied these valves axe also local agents. We had to use local agents frsKM.MSK to get the valves "because we wanted the system to work; and it did work</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OMIDO: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, is the Assistant Minister serious in telling this House that within a few days of the cancellation and disregard of the instructionsfrom the Ministry of Finance, prices could jump by nearly five times? Is this not a case where the Minister should have referred the matter to the police for further investigation "because it is clear that the Government has been swindled over Sh.l million?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KHASHAHALA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not know why hon. Members are having their own  HON. MEMBERS: What do you mean?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ICHASAKHALA: I am answering; you are not going to answer on my behalf.</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: Shame.'</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KHASAEHALA: The fact is that one valve had been tendered for and the price quoted was Sh.190,000/- HON. MEMBERS: What do you mean?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KHASAEHALA: Wait, I am answering. Then</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Karauri.): Order! Shall we listen to the Assistant Minister?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KHASAEHALA: The price quoted was Sh.l50,000/ oreach valve. After we SEE supplied  Local Purchase Order, theperson who had quoted the prices changed the prices and saidthat the price of each valve had increased to Sh.422,000/-. We then went to another local agent who deals in the same things, who quoted the price of Sh.225,484/- for each valve. When he was issued with Local Purchase Order, he changed his priceto Sh.395,000/- per valve.  Hon. Members should listen to thereply correctly and note that it is not one valve which cost Sh.l million; there are four valves costing Sh.395,000/- each, and the price comes to Sh. 1,580,000/- for the four of them.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister has avoided answer in the question raised by the hon. Questioner to the effect that there was: a letter from the Ministry of Finance which instructed the Director of Broadcasting to purchase the valves from a certain person at a certain price the & Director of Broadcasting refused to do so and did it in his own way. Can he tell us why the Director of Broadcasting sidestepped the instructions from the people who know about money? That is what we want to know. It can only be for one reason to swindle. Let him not defend that swindling; let him tell us why the g± Director of Broadcasting refused to take the instructions from the Ministry of Finance.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KHASAHALA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.all finances are audited and a report produced(noise)A report is produced to this House by the Controller and AuditorGeneral If hon. Members (noise)</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Karauri): Order! The Assistant Minister is answering the Question. If you want to listen to the reply, then you have to keep quiet so that you do not have further questions on what he ha3 replied to.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KHASHAHALA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir,if the hon. Member who has the Director of Broadcastinghaving refused to follow the instructions from the Ministry ofFinance has documents to that effect, he should produce themto the House and the Ministry h will take action onthe principles of those documents.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. SIFUNA: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister is continuing to mislead the House. Mr. Muinde is the one who was directed by the Director of Broadcasting to handle that particular corruption package.In the end, Mr. Muinde's daughter, who is not an employee of the e Ministry, travelled to Italy to train on how to handle Ampex equipment at the expense of the Government. She later presented herself at the Voice of Kenya for allocation of duties for coverage of the Games. She was assigned duties on the fourth camera OB Van at the Nyayo National Stadium, as a present to Mr. Muinde. I am going to lay these documents on the Table.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KHASAKHALA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have answered the Question as it was asked. Those details which are cropping up now involve the police9 and if the hon. Member has the details, he should come forward and we will take the s usual action through the Attorney General.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

We will go to the next order.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTISO: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir The Minister for Tourism and Wildlife is here. I do not know why he does not want to answer my Question.</Newspeech><Header>POINTS OP ORDER</Header><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary. Deputy Speaker, Sir. My point of order concerns what appeared in The Standard newspaper of Friday, 11th December, 1987? concerning the National Social Security Funds.7 billion not credited to members. In a 5 Press statement, the Director of the N.S.S.F. Mro Mulei, a said that this Sh.7 billion had been held in the suspense account because the N.S.S.F. had not been given vital information concerning the employees by the employers concerned, concerning the contributions of the members. He went further and said that the majority of the employers affected? were Government Ministries. He also said that 65 per cent of this money has been held in the suspense account. However, I do not agree with this report of the Director ofthe N.S.S.F. because it is quite unbelievable that they can/know the amount of money which has been submitted to the N.S.S.F. without the vital information. I think this is a cover-up story; maybe they, have kept this money elsewhere and they E are trying to cover themselves while they are trading with the money.should have taken action against thoseemployers who are not submitting the vital information concerningtheir employees contributions. That is why members of the Fund are suffering.In 19850 the Minister agreed here that out of thelent to £ a private financial institution without security,,Since then the Minister has g not told this House how much ofthe money has been remitted to the N.S.S.F. from the privatefinancial institution. I would now like the Minister forlabour to issue a Ministerial Statement on these workers money.Why is has the Ministry is kept quiet; why has the Ministrynot taken action against those employers who are not givingvital information to the N.S.S.F. The workers are suffering. The N.S.S.F. has admitted in this report that the workers are suffering. It will be talking a long time for the contributor to get their money because the Fund says that if a contributor applies for his money it takes a long time for the Fund to fish out that money from the suspense account, and take it to the contributor’s account.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, before this House goes on recess, the Minister should issue a Ministerial Statement to tell us and the workers the circumstances which led to this. He should also tell us what is happening in the National Social Security Fund. The Government should also probe this Fund.Thank you.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Karauri): Does the Minister for Labour wish to respond?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. arap Iietto): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have been listening to the remarks which have been made by the hon. Member and we will prepare a Ministerial Statement and give, it when it is ready.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KOSKE: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. My point of order is directed to the Ministry of Lands and Settlement. There has been a big delay on the completion of sub-division of land and also in the issue of title deeds. Although several Questions have been submitted to the House, the answers which were given to us were that there are very few surveyors in the country. Can the Minister for Lands and Settlement issue a Ministerial Statement to tell us"! the action he has taken or is taking to accelerate this matter?Thank you, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIKUYU Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise on a point of order concerning the general situation of drugs in our health centres, dispensaries, district hospitals and. provincial hospitals. I do not know much about the situation in the Kenyatta National Hospital. There is aserious shortage of all categories of drugs including pain killers in practically all dispensaries, health centres, district hospitals and provincial hospitals. This situation is causing untold sufferings to the sick who frequent these hospitals and their relatives are left wondering why this is happening and yet drugs are supposed to be provided in these hospitals. I believe it is time, if the Government cannot provide fluids for drugs, they started charging wananchi for the £ drugs rather than letting people stay in hospitals without treatment. We also need a proper explanation from the Minister for Health as to why he withdrew the kitty system of supplying drugs which was working so efficiently in the country? Since that system has now been withdrawn, all health centres and dispensaries in the country do not have drugs. This is a pathetic situation whereby sick people are denied their right and yet their relatives are not aware of it. ¥e need an explanation from the Minister on this issue.Thank you, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Karauri): Does the Ministry of Health wish to respond? It seems as though there is no response from the Ministry of Health. Let us continue.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OMIDO: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I rise to raise a matter of very serious concern and I believe it is a matter of national importance to this country. As the House is aware, we have been provoked by Uganda, a country which we thought was friendly.(Applause)They have decided to commit wanton crimes against our people. Sir, I wish to raise this matter under Standing Order No. 20 as a matter of national importance so that this House can discuss it.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Karauri): If you wish to that kind of matter, you have to consult the Speaker first. If you wish to	do so in the afternoon, you can consult the Speaker about it.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHUCUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.

MUNYAO: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker. Sir. I have two very short points of order to make. The first one is directed to the Minister for Supplies and Marketing About three or four weeks ago while the Mina Minister was replying to a Question here, in relation to food situation, he assure the House and the country that his Ministry is making arrangement for proper distribution and control of food prices to all parts of the country. I still have a lot of confidence to his statement. However, I would like to say that there is food shortage in some areas. For example in Kachakos District, the prices of maize range between Shs.280/=, Shs.300/ and Shs.350/= and the package is not the usual oneMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we feel that it will be in order for the Minister to make a Ministerial Statement streamlining the prices and distribution of foodstuffs, and also allowing the co-operatives which are more of communal organisation to hold food days as it happened in 1984-. He should give us that kind of assurance. 'Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have another short point of order which 'is addressed to the Office of the President. On 12th ; December, 1987, during the Jamhuri day celebrations, after the district officer read the Presidential address in Mwala, all the other celebrations which were supposed to come after the Kebr address football, dances and others  were cancelled, when these groups were ready to perform. We would want to know what insecurity was in Mbooni. We were also  told that the renewal to business licences will be censored by the Kanu organisation of the area and we do not know what it meant. This is an issue that is bringing a lot of fear to the business community in that area.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. Kitele): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have been trying our best to make sure that Kenyans get sufficient supply of foods. It was just the other day when hon. Ivuti requested me to open some maize selling centres. I have already opened three selling centres in his area. Hon. Ivuti is here and he can bear me witness. We do not open any selling centres unless we have been requested to do so.	All the same, I will make a MinisterialStatement regarding the prices of foodstuffs. If any hon. Member requires a maise selling centre in his area, we are prepared to deliver the foodstuff to the nearest place where people can buy from.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIPKORIR: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Minister of State, Office of the President promised to this House that he will issue a Ministerial Statement regarding the Duke of Manchester Farm, and till today, he has not issued it. The people of Elgeyo Marakwet are still waiting for that Ministerial Statement because they want to know what happened to their money.</Newspeech>	<Header>MOTION</Header><Newspeech>MR. MBORI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the following Motion:-THAT, in view of the fact that good road network may serve an important role in a given area as regards human communications, agricultural activities, commerce, industry etc. this House urges the Government to tarmac road Cl8 which links Oyugis - Rangwe - Rodi Kopany and Sori Centres in South Nyanza District.Sir, Safe South Nyanza District is a very bigdistrict in Nyanza Province and perhaps, people who do nothave s its geographical knowledge do not realise that it is big.South Nyanza District is half the size of the whole of Nyanza.Province. As regards communications, South Nyanza is perhapsvery, well served along lake Victoria because there are nohinderances there but when it comes to road network, we onlyhave one complete tarmac is road, from Rongo to Koma Bay. Thisroad has a distance of about 30: kilometres. Considering thatthis district is nearly three times bigger than the other districtsin Nyanza, this road is just a drop in the ocean. Therefore,I would like to request the Ministry of Transport andCommunications to link Oyugis with Sori Centre. I request theMinister a not to oppose this Motion. If this road isconstructed, it will add to the already short distant roadnetwork which is complete.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this road that I amtalking about is completely impassable during rainy seasons,and particularly between Rodi Kopany and Sori Centre.There is an area known as Aura Chuotho which is a stream of	mud if you had a four wheel drive car, it can never gothrough during the rainy season. Unless this road is tarmacked the people will never be able to travel from Oyugis which is in the highlands to the shores of LakeVictoria. If this road could be tarmacked it would serve as	an administrative links among the various administrative divisions that serve South Nyanza District. These divisions are Oyugis,Rangwe,i Biwe and Sori. Politically, this road would serveKasipul ndhiwa Kabondo, Homa Bay and ndhiwa, both of which will havetwo constituencies as from next year. So, if this road istarmacked it would serve this district very well.Sir, if this road is tarmacked it will help to raise thehuman communications. Human Communications, includecultural activities, educational activities social and maybe political and commercial activities. The people will be able to communicate easily if this road were tarmacked, otherwise, today this areas is very much faced by communication difficulties through no fault of the people who happen to be living in this particular part of the worldsMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this area is & highly potential in agriculture. There are various crops which are produced £ in this area and to mention a few there is cotton which is grown in the highlands that border Oyugis tea, pyrethrum, and later the people might grow	other crops.They also grow maize and between Rangwe and Rodi Kopany a lot of sugar-cane is grown16.12.87.A new sugar factory is being planned to serve a place called Opapo and, once thatis dono the road will be a link to the present South liyanza Sugar Company Agendo.That way, we will not only be maximising industry but, at the same time, we will bemaximising commerce, communication and other facilities in this area. So, the peopleof South Nyanza are asking for this kind of thing in reply to what this countrydemands? in reply to what the people need.- and because the people are devoted tonothing other than agricultural productivity. This is an area where cattle ranching \is extremely potential. Indeed, in Nyatike, a new constituency to he, there is a very important cattle ranching area. So, it goes without saying that when the road is tarmacked, this kind of stock trade will be enhanced and the people will be eng¬aged in activities which will be profitable to them.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, what I am talking about, according to the present day development projects of Kenya, is a plan which has gone through and which has been approved by the South Nyanza Development Committee. Down the lake- shore in Sori, people find it easier to move into Tanzania because they can use their boats, canoes and other sailing vessels. However, people in that area find it very difficult to come upcountry through land routes because this road becomes completely impassable during the wet weather, mainly in the months of March, April and May. These months become very wet and the area also becomes very muddy, that it has been given the name of the stream  I named earlier  Aura Chuodo.Sir, we need this road because, as I said earlier, South Nyanza is a vast district. Failure to give it a proper road network is a disservice. If the construct ion of this road is started, we will be very much appreciative to the Ministry of Transport and Communication which has been doing a very good job. We also want it to do the same to South Nyanza District. This road I am talking about is of a distance of 140 kilometres only. By the time it has been completed, it will not only serve South liyanza District but also the neighbouring Kisii District which also grows sugar-cane that also requires to be transported. This is a bulky kind of crop that requires good road network for transportation. By the time this roadis completed, the link between Nairobi and Sori will be at hand because, as youknow, the railway line reaches kisumu which is the provincial headquarters. Therearc also routes on the taken how which lead to the round-abouts in parts of Nyanza,and Sori happens to be one of them it is one of the way by which you can reachSori from Nairobi One way of transporting the sugar-cane which is produced fromOpapo and Awendo is by tarmacking this road so that this bulky good can be carriedalong a good road then downwards to the £ lakeshore Sori. That way, we will allow the product to come to other parts of Kenya through the railways system.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this will be a fair way of enabling our people to have an accomplishment of transport communication of human souls, goods and other merchandise which we require. In doing so, we shall be definitely enhancing commerce and industry in this country, something we require so much for our existence. If this is not done, then there will be a part of South Nyanza District which will be lying dormant. I am glad that most of the hon. Members from South Nyanza District, who know more about this area, are here. If there is a section I will have not talked about, then I know that hon. Members e who will be affected by the line which Trill run from Oyugis through Rangwe, Rody Kopany and Ndhiwa downwards to Sori will definitely support ne. As I have said before, the Ministry of Transport and Communi¬cations should see sense and accept this Motion as it is because, in doing so, it will merely be replying to the fact that a good road network enables an area to be opened up, advanced and be in contact m not only with the immediate neighbourhood but even with the distant neighbourhood.Sir, I know that the Ministry of Transport and Communications has a lot of work at the moment, but I would like to ask it to look at Sough Nyanza as a vast district which suffers because it receives the same portion of the national cake as the smaller districts. Whereas we could ask that our neighbouring district receive one portion of the national cake,  we would ask that we receive three times the size of the portion received by the smaller districts.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not want to tire the House with a lot of information about this road. However, I think I have giventhe necessary information to the relevant Ministry and the House. At this point, I would request the Chair to allow me to call upon hon. Kanindo to second the Motion. With those few remarks, Sir, I beg to move.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KANINDO: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Before I start seconding the Motion, I would like to thank hon. Mbori for having brought it to the House.This is a very important Motion because the road in question runs from Kasipul Kabondo Constituency and, along the route, passes through very important centres. The reason why this road 5 requires to be tarmacked urgently is that it has been approved by the South Nyanza District Development Committee as top priority. On the way from Oyugis, before you reach Rangwe, there is Mititi Secondary School with over 400 students who suffer very much during rain seasons due to lack ofproper transport. This is so particularly at the end of school terms. From MititiSecondary School there is Bodera Forest, which is also a very important area in thedistrict. There is also Asumbi Girls Secondary School and Asumbi Teachers Training College which have over 2,000 students.This road is important because it facilitates their movement. In wet weather, the road sometimes becomes impassable and the parents who would like to collect their children from school find it difficult to reach the school. On several occasions, we have requested that this roadbe improved.I remember that when hon. Kosgey was the Minister for Transport Communications, he toured the road and gave the hope that it was not going to take too long before it was tarmacked. A recommendation on the same road was made by the Kenya Tea Development Authority to the effect that the land there is good and the names of potential areas for tea growing were submitted here. The tarmacking of this road has also been given approval by the local District Development Committee because there is also a sugar factory in the area. He count all these ways in which the tarmacking of this road is going to benefit Kenyans. When you have sugarcane being grown in an area, we expect to get sugar there. Sugar is consumed by all Kenyans all over the Republic. That road has always been a problem.Moving on, you will find that we have a big-secondary school near the road, known as ogandi Girls Secondary School, with well over 1,500 students. We take into consideration the fact that we also have Boarding Primary School, in addition to Girls Secondary School with its two streams of students and teachers. This road is always a problem. If you tour the road right now, you will find that it is almost impassable because the bridge across it is worn out.This road passes through a fertile area with a heavy maize production. Groundnuts also do very well here. A road is always tarmacked after considering the heavy productivity of the area it serves and the other benefits that are going to come out the exercise, besides the traffic the road is going to service Rodi Kopany is an important trading area.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me thank the Ministry of Transport and Communications  it i3 good to thank the Ministry while we talk about this particular road  for the work they have done. You will find thatthe construction of a telephone network in the area is going on very well. I wish that the way this construction is going on applies to roads as well.While talking about this Motion, let me say that when we come to tarmacking this road after the Motion has been passed it will be important to remember that the contractor who is going to be given the job should be able to do it properly. The Homa Bay-Rongo Road, which was tarmacked just a few years ago, is now wearing out and it will soon require repairs. Despite the fact that funds were made available, and the local District Development Committee and the Government did well in tarmacking the road, the road is wearing out so soon afterwards. So, regardless of how much money we have already used on this road, we are now going to do the same job again. Let me request the Ministry to ensure that when they award the tender for the tarmacking of this road, those who are awarded the contract are able to do a good job and get the road into a good shape.The area between Rodi Kopany and'Karungu is very difficult as will be confirmed by hon. Mak Anyengo here who represents the area. Sometimes, he finds it difficult to tour his constituency during the rains. At times, necessary fund raising drives have to be postponed until the weather is dry. The tarmacking of this road is important considering that Ndhiwa is a very rich area in respect of food production. The people there do not know what to do because they work hard, but transportation of food crops, such as maize, to stores is becoming impossible. This is why we are requesting the Ministry to take it seriously and see that this road is tarmacked.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, considers that we have Mirugi Girls and Mirugi Boys Secondary Schools in the area under question. We also have Ndhiwa Town, which is the headquarters of Ndhiwa Constituency. Getting officers to the headquarters sometimes becomes impossible when you get to Rachuotho, and this delays certain action that should be taken immediately. This is why we are appealing to the Minister concerned to tarmack this road urgently.The tourist industry has not played a major role in South  NyanzaDistrict simply because of the poor condition of the roads there. We have very important things there for the tourist to sec Tourist attractions are not only at the Coast where tourists normally go South Nyanza District, with a population of over one million people, has only 30 kilometres of tarmacked roads. I think it is high time this district was given its rightful share of the national "cake". When you consider its population and the 30 kilometres of tarmacked roads it has you find that we are not getting our rightful share of the national "cake" in respect of tarmacked roads.We are not getting as many tourists there 33' we should, and if this road is tarmacked, it will be a step forward' towards getting our share of tourist so The road will make sure that no matter how many tourists visit the country, we have some going to South Ivyanza0 Tourists have automatically abandoned visiting South Nyanza, and we are now not getting a good number of them, and yet we have such historical places there, such as Sindi Ifyaima, Homa, with a still active volcano and Rangwe Forest with a good game variety. There are many more such places in the area.This road will also enable people from Mbita through Godbura(?) to movewithout problems Sometimes the condition of this road deters people working outside their home places from going home during the as rainy season because they might not reach their homes and come back to work in time the next day. I appeal to the Ministry of Transport and Communications to look for funds to facilitate the tarmacking of this road. We have recommended the tarmacking of this road through the local District Development Committee as required and we appeal to this House to implement this recommendation. We request that it be tarmacted in order to serve the important parts of the district with a heavy agricultural potential so that we may feed Kenyans who need the maize in the area, we should help our people to produce cash crops there.We have the opportunity of producing tea. We also have coffee farmers who take a long time to get their coffee to the right destination, particularly during the rainy season. This road has been deserted, and the cost of travellingby matatu on the other roads is always very high because the owners of these matatu get them worn out on a single trip So, they have to inflate their charges because of the bad condition of those roads0Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir5 the people of this area are loyal and devoted to serving the Government. They heed to be served just like any other Kenyans in the Republic This is why we appeal that this road be tarmacked.Now that ray time is gone, I appeal to the Ministry with these few remarks to work out a plan so that this road is tarmacked. I beg to second.</Newspeech> (Question proposed)<Newspeech>MR. arap KOSKE: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me an opportunity to make some contribution to this Motion,, First of all, I would like to thank the hon. Mover for having found time to prepare and bring this Motion to the House0 As far as I am concerned, the Motion deserves support in that it brings out the idea of our economy We need a reasonable economy for our necessary subsistence.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is not easy to achieve reasonable economy without good roads. We need to have reasonable agricultural production and trade in order to achieve the necessary economy. However, such reasonable agricultural production and trade may not be possible without good roads and therefore,this Motion is ideal and should be supported if funds for implementing it areavailable, as they no really say. I am saying "this because the tarmacking of thisroad is actually ideal for such an area as South Nyansa District.   Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, lack of good roads normally curtailstrade and agricultural production. I know of some areas where shops areaclosed during the rainy seasons until such a time when the weather is dry. Thisis because fuel cannot be transported to such places nor can goods be transported	to the shops due e to lack of means of transportation. I do not need to emphasize thefact that even people need to move from one area to another to buy or sell goods in various places. However, without good roads trade is actually curtailed if not paralysed completely.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have areas where the picking of tea and the transportation of milk is done daily and when roads in such areas are in poor condition or when there are no bridges, toe, tea and milk industries		Come to a standstill and the farmers are discouraged and even a number of people are forced to leave their jobs. If these roads cannot be tarmacked due to lack of funds, then they should be improved into all weather roads, particularly in farming areas, where farmera need to transport their agricultural produce to the market everyday throughout the year.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I have said before when customers cannot reach the industries, then the problem is similar because trade is actually curtailed  while supporting this Motion, I would also like to appeal to the Govern¬ment to see to it that we have enough access roads, particularly in the newly sub¬divided farms. Before we attained our Independence, the colonialists had very large farms. Some of these farms were as large as a location and when wananchi bought these farms, they had to subdivided them. After the subdivision of thesefarms, some of the farmers found themselves without access roads to the main 	road. Therefore, it becomes a big problem to even transport patients to thehealth  centres. It is very annoying to transport a pationt for a long distanceon a stretcher.  therefore, I appeal to the Government to see to it that wherethere has been subdivision of farm rendering farmers to have no  access roads,something be done to enable them transport their agricultural produce tothe market and also be able to transport their patients to the health centres when necessary.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to touch, on the questionof security. In places where there are no access roads, people have a lot ofdifficulties in sending messages, say, to the district office to the chiefsoffice or to the police station due to lack of proper roads. Therefore, it isvery important that we have good access roads in all places where wananchi live.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, because of the high population which isstill growing, we have the unemployment problem increasing at a very high rate.We need to encourage our youth to practice self employment. Hot all our youtheither in the public or in the private sectors will be able to get employment said this is a statement which we cannot avoid tomake. This is because of high population growth and scarcity of employmentopportunities. Therefore, it is ideal to have, sore roam for encouraging ouryouth to take trade tests so that they can be able to take up selfemploymentjobs for themselves. I know it is very espensive to tarmac a roads in all	places more or less at the same time, but it is also as equally bad and expensive, to have very many unemployed youth in the country. When wehave such a situation then of course, we shall continue to have serious problems.	Whenwe have a lot of youths with no employment and no land, then they will have no means of living. For this reason, it is important for 1i.e Government to censider tamarcking this road in order to solve such problems as lack of employment and the rest.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, while also supporting this Motion, I would like to urge the Government to see to it that it continues to tarmac the read from Fort Tarnan to Londiani. This road has been tarmacked from Muhoroni to Londiani but the construction work for the remaining section has actually delayed for a long time and I would like to urge the Government to make sure that the	tarsoacking of this road is continued up to Londiani so that it can facilitate easy travelling from Kisumu to Nairobi. This road, if tarmacked, would open up that area which is also very good in agricultural production. I am saying this because farmers in this area grew coffee, pyrethrum maize and we also have quit some good business there.	With those few remarks, I beg to support this Motion.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>THE ASSISTAHT MINISTER FCR FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Mr. Mak’Anyengo): Thank you, MR.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I stand to support the Motion. In so doing I would also give some due credit to the Ministry for certain things that have been done in connection with it.Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as the other speakers have stated, this road is a very, very important one, because it runs throughout South Nyanza. Actually it divides South Nyanza into two halves, the southern half and the northern half; it runs through almost half of the locations in South lyanza, from Kaspul-Kabondo through Homa Bay and Ndhiwa Constituencies right up to our border with both Tanzania and Uganda. The area through which this road rims is a very rich are one; the soil is very rich. You can grow anything in it; mentionAny crop and will grow there. In actual fact, it passes through an area which has been approved for growing tea and coffee, besides sugar-cane and other local crops like simsim, groundnuts and many others. So, it is important that the Governmen has thought of working on this road.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other thing that I would like to say is that the Government, or the Ministry, should speed up the starting of the job in this area. I happen to know that almost half of it has beer, surveyed and all the necessary work has been done. what is remaining now is for the matter to be brought up for tendering and then the work starts. I feel that the sooner it is done the better. This is because there is plenty of rain in this area; we have two rainy seasons, which receive very heavy rainfall. Luring the rainy season, as my colleague had stated earlier, there are some places which you cannot reach by road. This is because the road is a black-cotton-soil road, and during the rainy season vehicles cannot use it. I remember that during the last rainy season, for a distance of only 13 kilometres, the matatu people were chargingSh.45 for a single journey. This was due to the fact that there were very few vehicles that could brave the road. At the same time, if any vehicle owner uses that road for six months, the vehicle will get worn out.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in order to help the people, I would urge the Ministry to do the best they can to speed up the opening of this road. I am sure that by opening it we shall in encourage the production of crops. As Istated earlier, I am sure that with good roads, the areas through which this runs,particularly in Ndhiwa Constituency, production will be increased to the extent thatwe can be able to feed the whole of Nyanza and Rift Valley Provinces in terms ofcrops like maize, millet, groundnuts, simsim and choroko. I would not like takemuch of the time, because I know that the Ministry is doing something about thisroad. My only urge is that the Ministry should speed up the start of the work. If possible by next year, as was recommended by our district development committee, work, on the road should start. This will give us the challenge of using the road to increase production.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in addition to that, for this road to be very useful, we would like ±s the Ministry to also think in terms of feeder roads; the minor roads that would feed this road from the interior. There isin the programme of the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife what is known as the Southern Circuit. At present, the tourists do not utilise the facilities that axe in the Southern Circuit due to the fact that there are nofeeder roads. Takefor example Tourists fly from Kichwa Tempo to the Lakeshore in order to fish, because there are no roads. Otherwise, roads could have opened the Lakeshore and the tourist industry to the extent that those investors who would like to put up lodges andhotels along the lake would do so. But at present this has not been done becausethe roads leading to those areas have not been, opened. So, I would urge the Ministry that, in addition to this major road, they should also construct all weather minor roads in order to encourage and boost the tourist industry in this area.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to remind the Ministry that we have the Rambwe National Park, and that if this roads done we will be getting more revenue from the tourists who visit Rambwe National Park. In addition to that, we have a museum in North Kadem, known as Timilichi; it has been idle; nobody has been visiting it because of lack of roads, we also have fishing facilities on the lake; there are Nile perch in the lake, some of them bigger than myself. If these roads are opened, I am sure that those tourists who would like to go to Mombasa for fishing would turn their minds to Lake Victoria: visit it and see very good sceneries in this area.Mr. Temporal Deputy Speaker, Sir, with these remarks, I would only like to thank the Ministry for the much they have done so far. But so far, the much they have done is little. So, we would like them to speed up and do more in ± order to open this area for the general development of this country.Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. DR. OMAKO: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to support the Motion. I happen to Know this road very well. I remember way back in 1963/64 when I was the district agricultural officer, there,this road was my headach number one, the Oyugis-Rangwe-Rodi Kopany-Sori Road.Iwould like to support what my hon, colleagues have said about the necessity of this road being tarmacked. This road is like an artery: other veins and little capillaries get into it.[The Temporary Iteputy Speaker (Mr. Karaurj.) left the Chair ]	[Mr.Deputy Speaker took the Chair]	I remember in 1964 when we wanted to teach the small farmers modern farming, there was no road cutting across the half of South Nyanza District. You had to go through the periphery: you go to Kisii; enter a tarmac road; then go back towards Awendo, and get on up to beyond Kenhancha. But there was nothing right in the interior to help you get to the farmer.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other point, which the Ministry should take into consideration, is that right now a lot of fuel is being burned by people travellin, from Qyugis to Homa Bay via Kisii and Rongo and then into Rodi Kopany. This is because the area between Qyugis, Rongo aridRodi Kopany happens to form a triangle. Now, we were taught in elementary mathematics that the sum of two triangles is greater thanthe third the third is always shorther when you add two sides of a triangle.</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: Even Modern Mathematics!</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. OMAMO: I do not know even modern Mathematics, but I am using the old ones. But a lot of fuel is being burnt by motorists trying to get to tarmackcd roads.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, my colleagues have said rightly that this kind of road will promote agricultural production, and I quite agree with them. I also agree that tea may be planted there, but I am not sure the kind of variety. Pyrethrum has been mentioned, but I do not know the variety. pyrethrum that has been recommended. However, sugarcane does very well in that area. That is sugarcane area with its black cotton soil mixed with that light soil common in South Nyanza. It is the ideal land for sugarcane, and with the rain¬fall available, the Opwapo or Opapo Sugar Factory will have no difficult in getting sufficient supply of sugarcane.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other crop which I would like to stress because it is important for the nationals that between now and' the year 2000, in our Development Plan, some 50,000 hectares of robusta coffee should be grown here in Kenya. I am sure with 50,000 hectares of robusta coffee, the district that will have the lion's share is South Nyanza District. It is South Nyanza District that should grow for Kenya the additional robusta coffee which we are lacking in the world market today. All that good soil the soil that has produced the hon.Mover of the Motion, hon, Mbori, the great Mak’Anyengo, and “Okuku Danger" this is the kind of soil that should produce for Kenya the robusta coffee that we must add to the traditional arabica coffee in other areas. We are lacking robusta coffee in the world market todai We do not have it. But our neighbours in Uganda grow plenty of robusta coffee and of good quality. Therefore, South Kyanza should be keyed up with proper road system and proper road infrastructure to enable the small-scale farmer to grow robusta coffee for Kenya.My last point, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, is that this road 	Oyugis - Rangwe - Rodi Kopany and Sori Centres in South Nyanza District should be considered seriously as one of the security roads in Kenya. I happe to come from the border, and today we are bothered by neighbours. I do not want to mention their names, but they are bothering us.</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: They are not!</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. OMAMO: Well, they are bothering us and they are also doing all sorts of things. We are going to react. Even if we bite them with our teeth, we will react. This road should be considered as a security road so that our security officers can move quickly from Kericho, Kisii, JCisumu and get to Sori Centres in South Kyanza. This is the road that I would compare with Ndori., Aram, Ragenyi, Luanda Kotieno Road in Bondo. This is also the	road with the same rankas Bondo, Manyuanda and Misori Road in Bondo. These are security roads. Much as I know that it costs a lot of money to tarmac roads, it is myplea with the Ministry and the Government that some money be found so that these security roads are done at once.With those few remarks, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I fully support the Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. arap Koech): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I wish to assure the House, through you, that the Government appreciates the sentiments of the Mover, and that the Government has been and is still improving those road communication networks throughout the country in order to enhance human communication, agricultural activities, commercial activities and also industrial activities. The Government will do everything possible to improve various roads throughout the country, but within the Budgetary provisions.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, in South Nyanza District, the road networks which are being undertaken by the Government are quitecommendable. This is because we are already doing a road at the momentfrom Kisii/Kisumu junction all the way to Homa Bay, and also the roadfrom Homa Bay through Rodi Kopany to the Kisii/Kisumu junction againis already done. So, you can see that the Government is doing a verygood job to improve the road communication networks in South Nyanza.Now, the hon. Members have spoken about South Nyanza giving a lot of good qualities which are indeed true. There are very good roads, a lot of agricultural activities in terms of sugarcane and so on. I also do understand that coffee is being started to be grown in those particular areas.Now, on this particular road, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, which the hon. Mover has requested the Government to tarmac, I want to say that the Motion is already overtaken by events because the Ministry is already committed to tarmacking some sections of this road, and we have already moved much ahead. In fact, I believe that we have moved much ahead of the Mover. At the moment, if I could give a broad coverage, the road from Oyugis - Rangwe - Rodi Kopany to Sori Centre which I also understand, is known as Karungu has a length of 81 km. Now, the 48 km. section, that is between Rodi Kopany and Sori Centres is now being considered for bitumenisation. Survey and designs are already completed. In fact, the compilation for, the tender document is at hand, and the work for tarmacking the road is going to start soon, or as soon as the funds allow. Otherwise, we have already done the groundwork. So, this road is alreddy completed. That is why I said the request is already overtaken by events. So, that section of 48 km. is going to be tarmacked.Nov., the 12 km. section, that is between Rangwe and Rodi Kopany, was gravelled only last year, and it is in very good condition. Now, from Rangwe to Oyugis, the road was graded in January, and the Ministryis making sure that from Oyugis to Rodi Kopany the road is alwaysIn very good motorable condition. Of couise, I have already said thatthe section of 43 km. from Kodi Kopany is going to be tarmacked soon.So, it is going to serve all the sentiments expressed by hon. Members.This road is also going to reach the border. So, if it is a security type of a road, we know that the Government is already doing something about it.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, many hon. Members have spoken about quite a good number of roads passing through areas of great agriculture potential. Now, it is the Ministry's view to ensure that these areas are actually made to be accessible, and the Ministry is doing everything possible toensure that these are made passable so that they can improve the agricultural development in the country, the commercial development and also the industrial development.So, since there is nothing to amend because the road has already been overtaken by events, I only wanted to let the House know that the Ministry is already committed to this road. I do hope that the hon. Mover is going to bear with us. It would be the wish of the Government to  complete the whole road, butthis is going to be done when this other section is completed  and then we are going to start on the programme to settle the designs on the remaining roads. So, this section will be handled well. Since this is something which is straightforward, I do not think I need to spend so much time to give the hon. Mover more information I would only say that the Government is truly committed to the improvement of this particular road.With these few remarks, I beg to tell the House that, the Motion is already overtaken by events because we are already casing working on this road.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ANGATIA: Thank you very much Mr. Deputy Speaker,Sir, for giving me this chance so that I make a few comments on this Motion.The Assistant Minister has left us wondering whether he is supporting, opposing or amending the Motion or whether he is inviting us to talk when he knows that nothing is going to be done at the end. Nevertheless, despite the dead position in which he left us, we want to encourage him to go home and. dosomething about it and not just to leave it</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr.arap Koech)) On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. My point of order is that I do not know what the hon. MemberWas Maybe he did not follow my sentiments, I said verycategorically: How can we say that we urge the Government tosomething which it is already doing? We are already doing thisroad. So, I think what the hon. Member should stand up and sayis that he thanks the Government for going ahead of the hon.Members wishes in the implementation of this particular project.We are already doing so. What do you want me to amend? Do youwant me to say that we are not going to do it? Maybe, whatyou can only request us is that if we can do it sooner, the betterand I think that will be more meaningful.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ANGATIA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think that isan acceptance from the of the Government that while someparts and we are thankful for it, they are going to do theremaining parts which are mentioned in this Motion. So when eventually, weapprove this Motion, we are hopping that the Minister will extend the work that he has already done to those parts which he has not done, and which this Motion covers.Therefore, I want to thank the Member who raised this</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! I Can I put something straight first? This is directed to the Frontbenchers Normally, where a Motion is not going to change, we advise that the Minister responsible responds before the Mover replies. The purpose of that is to enable the Minister to respond to some of the other things that the Members have already raised  Ministerially as a policy. As hon. Angatia raised it, this particular oneHas left us a little bit hanging. Although as has been said by the Assistant Minister, work has already started on this particular road but Meaners who still want to contribute on this still have the Floor until the time allocated for it expires because I think there will be allot to be reflected.Unfortunately, the Minister will not have a second chance to Respond and the Mover will have to come at the end. Can we go on now?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MGATIA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am very gratefulto you for making it clear.  I want to urge the Minister, as Ihad already said, to go and look for ways and means ofextending the work that has already been started on part of thisroad to cover those parts which are mentioned in this particularMotion but which he had not yet started working on. I haveonly two points to make.The first one is to ask the Ministry to look into waysof constructing permanent roads or roads in which some degree ofbitumen has been put on in a cheaper way. The figures we heargiven to us through the Press and other means of communicationare very frightening. they talk of millions of shillings forconstructing one kilometre of road. With all this period sinceIndependence, we would have expected the Ministry to have carried out some investigation:Is there 110 way we can build our roads cheaper than we are doing at the moment  tarmac roads? Tarmack roads seem to consume a lot of money and some of them do not last very long. They go out of use in a very short time or they require resurfacing and therefore we spend further millions of shillings within a very short time. We have got very many examples of roads of this kind between Nakuru and Eldoret; between Ainabkoi and Kapsabet a very short roadthat was done very nicely recently only sudden has very dangerous potholes. We want to know whether these large expenditures are giving us permanent roads or whether they are giving us roads that arc of a temporary nature  that within three years, they should be done again. If this is the case, can the Ministry carry cut someresearch to find cheaper ways of building roads so that we know if we are going to be redoing them every three or five years, they are reasonable enough and they are in good enough conditions for us to drive on comfortably without dangerous potholes, some of  which are contributing to the road accidents today.The second point that I want to put to the Minister isthat there are roads which are built in this countryAll districts in this country have sponsored roads called Rural Development Fund Roads and are also those ones called the Rural Access Roads. While the Rural Access Roads are being maintained to some degree and this is a very good arrangement as we have said many time s before  we find that no one maintains the Rural Development Fund Roads. Of late, we have noticed some roads, particularly in Kaksmega, which have turned into gullies due to erosion because they are not maintained. The Treasury gave money to the district the district gave money for this work to be done under the Rural Development Fond Programme; good roads were built  earth roads which were very good. But because they are not maintained, they are worn out water is now flowing on them so that where roads were constructed, we have merely accelerated the formation of big gullies on which water is flowing, carrying  away our soil. We would like the Ministry of Transport and Communications to initiate the formulation of a policy on the Rural Development Fund Roads. What is going to be done about it? Are we going to build these roads and give them to wananchi who cerebrate for having got a good road only</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR.DEPUTY SPEAKER: Sorry, Mr. Angatia. The Chair is a little bit at a loss because you have used this title Rural Development Fund Roads which I am not aware where it fits.Maybe I do not know whether this is a new title by the Ministry; but I have never heard about it myself and it may give a misleading connotation.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ANCATIA: Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I am trying to differentiate between the rural accessroads which is a very special programme  which are very¬beautifully done they are murramed and are maintained by theWananchi.Tney are very good roads although the Ministry has doeshavenot seem to taken them over yet. But there is another class ofroads which are done from the District Development Fundsallocations to each district. The various districts use thisRural Development Funds on different things  youth polytechnicsschools, roads, cattle-dips and so on. In some cases, someroads in Kakamega are built out of these funds. They are const¬ructed by wananchi who are paid and the intention we had was to later hand them over to Ministry of Transport and Communications. These are the roads I am talking about I do not know whether they exist in other districts, but in Kakamega we have got several of them. Unfortunately, after they have been finished, they are not handed over to the Ministry or the Ministry of Transport and Communications does not take them over. But because there are no funds allocated for maintainance, they are used and used and wear out very rapidly especially under the heavy rains that fall in those parts of the country, and after a shorttime they 	turn into water gullies. These are the roads that I am talking about and I want to urge the Ministry of Transport and Communications to allocate funds for the maintainance of these roads. If it cannot allocate funds for maintainance of these road then they should formulate a policy on whether Rural Development Funds could he used in the construction of roads. If they were taken over, no road can be constructed in places like Kisii,Kakamega and be left without being maintained. It could even turn into a water gully if it is constructed and not maintained.Therefore, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to appeal to the Ministry of Transport and Communications to formulate a policy on this one and mean while take over the roads that have been done so far. The Ministry should take over those roads, classify them arid maintain them in the normal way that roads are maintained in this country. So, I urge the Minister to look into this. Also I would like to thank the Minister for the tarmack work that has been done in this country. But as I have stated this ±s appears to be a very expensive affair. Right now a road is being constructed between Turbo and Webuye. The work is being done very well indeed. But our worry like it has been on the road between Nakuru and Eldoret and between Ainabkoi and Kapsabet  is that the large sums of money that are being spent on these roads may not give good roads for a long enough time. we may find that we will be called upon to spend more money within three or five years to come.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, by now the Ministry ought to have formulated ways of building these roads to last a very long if we are going to spend those millions of shillings that I hear about. The Ministry should formulate ways of doing roads relatively cheaply but roads that will give us the service that, we want.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, before I conclude my speech, I would like to thank the Minister for re-opening and widening the shoulders of the roads between Kapsabet and Chavakali. But a similar job is not being done on the road between Kakamega and Webuye. I am suspecting that the Ministry has set aside the necessary 22iitx funds and has told a contractor to go and do it But the work is being done in. pieces and patches. We do not know whether this is really what the Ministry intended to do; to widen the shouldersof the already tarmacked road to make sure that the edges ofthe road do not wear out too quickly.With those few remarks, I beg to support the Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I have got only a few points to make on this Motion. I was very happy when the Assistant Minister said that this Motion has been taken over by events. That means that the Ministry has been going round trying to identify roads which need to be tarmacked.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to state here that transport and communications and other facilities are very essential in the farming industry. These things put together form what economists call catalysts of economic development. This is because we cannot have a rapid economic growth unless we have reliable means of transport and communications. These things enable us to market our farm produce without problems. Farmers should be able to take their goods to the markets. This  makes it easy for many people to participate in the agriculture sector of this country.	Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir, when the Ministry gives a job to a certain contractor it must make sure that that contractor sticks to the specifications which are approved by the Ministry The contractor must use the correct materials that have been approved by the Ministry. I say this because sometime back a certain job was given to a company known as Esasso. The contractor was given a contract to tarmack the Magongo road. But you will find that the road did not last more than two months. But I am happy to note that the Ministry has ordered the contractor to do the job again.Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would also like to thank the Mover of this Motion because the road which 2±k links Oyugis - Rangwe- Rodi Kopany and Sori Centres will benefit the people in those areas. The farmers in those areas will benefit from this road and as a result the whole country will also benefit. The Ministry should go round the country and try to pinpoint roads which need tarmacking. There are some roads which should be given first priority. A roadshould not be tarmacked just because it is in a Minister's constituency. All Ministers should have a national outlook to every tiling in this country. Roads which lead to farming areas should be given priority. Roads leading to coffee growing areas and  those in major urban centres should be given first  priority. This will enhance the growth of our economy.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is not good, to over-burden a contractor. If a contractor has been, given a job somewhere he should not be given, a second job before he completes the first one. If a contractor has a job he should be left alone to complete that job before he is given another job. we have enough contractors in this country.Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Ministry concerned should indigenise the building and construction industry in this country. We should not rely on foreign contractors. It is good to support our indigenous contractors Y/ho repair our roads and so on. This particular Ministry of Transport and Communications is doing a good job. The Ministry is paying attention to the problems facing our people in this country.I also want to commend the Kenya Railways Corporation for what they are doing. The other day I heard that the Corporation has purchased 10 locomotive engines. But the truth is that this Corporation needs more such engines. This is because railway is the cheapest means of transport we have in this country. So, the Ministry of Transport and Communications should support that parastatal body.In conclusion, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, since the Mover of the Motion specified the roads which need to be tarmacked the Ministry should not just tarmack some sections. The road mentioned in this Motion should be tarmacked completely.With those few points, I beg to support the Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWARUWA: Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to join my colleagues in contributing on this Motion. This Motion is very} very important; particularly to the people of Kasipul-Kabondo and Kenya at large. The Ministry of Transport and Communications is one of the richest Minis tries in this country. We therefore urge this Ministry to visit every part of the country and inspect all roads. It should not concentrate its activities in the City of Nairobi and other big towns. Most of us come from rural areas and that is where the Ministry should direct its attention to. Nairobi City and Ma Mombasa Municipality do not benefit the Government very much. This is because all farmers are in the rural areas and</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. KILIEU: On a point of order, Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is it in order for the hon. Member to say that this country does not benefit from Nairobi and Mombasa when, we know that the Port of Mombasa collects a lot of foreign currency for this country? why is he saying that the Government does not benefit from Nairobi and Mombasa? Can he withdraw that remark?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWARUWA: Mir. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am a farmer and I come from the rural areas. I produce food for people living in this City and other major towns. Also as a farmer, I  experience a lot of problems. We have problems because there are no roads in our area. There are no roads and we are unable to bring our farm produce to Nairobi and Mombasa. So, through, this Motion which is very important, we urge the Ministry concerned to make sure that roads are constructed in every part of this country. These roads will it easy for the farmers to bring their crops to towns to feed the nation.</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: Watu wa mijini hawana mashamba.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWARUWA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is high timeour Government valued roads more than anything else. We do not want to be beggars. We do not want to beg for food from other countries. We want to produce our own food. This is why I am saying that we need good roads in the rural areas. If there are no good roads farmers I being included will bediscouraged. They will not be interested in farming activities any longer.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am saying this a frommy own experience. There are a lot of farm products which gobad because the farmers cannot get quick transport to enablethem transport these products to the city or towns. For instance,I was once invited as a guest of honour at Kasipul-Kabondo whereI saw hard-working people doing a lot of farming. But it tookme a long time to get to where the meeting was to take place.I had to leave ray car along the way and walk some distance. Atone time, I had to jump across a small river. This was verydiscouraging.We are the only people supporting this Government.This Government is ours, and when we need something, we haveto tell the Government. The Government cannot know all the problems in every place. We have to tell it the problems we experience in our areas. By so doing, it does not mean that we do not like our Government; we love it and we need it. But where we need its help, we have to stand up and say so. That is what I am doing here.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, when you go to Mombasa North to a place called Mwakirunge, you find that the inhabitants are farmers but, unfortunately, even a pregnant woman who is just about to give birth finds it very difficult to get to h a maternity hospital because there is none nearby and the roads are no good. When it rains for two days, no vehicle can go there The Ministry of Transport and Communications should take care of that place. The people in that area pay heavy tax and so they expect services from the Government.Kwale District is t a district just like any other in the country. In that district there is a place called Lukore and another one called Majimboni. The people of these areasare the ones who feed Mombasa until now. Two weeks ago, Imade a friendly tour to those areas and I really pitied, thosefarmers when I saw how they transport their farm products to	Mombasa. The roads there as are “rotten.” They are murram roads and nobody takes care of them, so when it rains, it means that those farm products have to stay there until the rain stops. The Ministry should spread its people throughout the country so that they go to the places where there are farmers who need to transport their farm products. Those are the most la impor¬tant places where the Ministry should send its people to serverepairingand give the people assistance in	these roads andtarmacking them.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for the first timein history, the Assistant Minister has said that theGovernment  is already committed taking t care of the roadsin Kasipul-Kabondo. We have been asking questions about roadsfor a long time in this House but there has been no responseBut today, I feel very happy with the reply by the Assistant	Minister for Transport and Communications to the effect thatthe Government is taking care of those roads. This should bedone all over the country to ensure that roads are well takencare of Where tarmacking  is required, this should bedone, because the Ministry of Transport and a Communicationshas a lot of money. When I am coming from Mombasa, I pay toll charges at the Nyali Bridge, which is under the Ministry of Transport and Ccmmunications. When I reach Machakos, I pay some more at the toll station. At Gilgil, there isanother toll station. Every day, the Ministry of Transport and Communications earns around Sh.l million. If you do the calculations of this money, you will find thatthe Ministry gets a lot of money, which can easily enable the  to repair to repair all the country's roads and even tarmac them to make the country look more beautiful and become more useful to the farmers who would be encouraged to do more farming. At the moment, the farmers do not have good roads by which they can transport their products to big towns like Mombasa and Kisumu and the city of Nairobi.  Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is us who have been sentHere by the voters; it is not everybody who has had an access into this place. The few of us who have managed to come here have to pinpoint the necessary roads which need tarmacking. In so doing, the country would benefit.My hon. friend here, who stood and challenged me when I said that Mombasa and Nairobi do not benefit the Govern¬ment, was wrong. He did not know what he was talking about. Maybe he did not understand my English. He is an hon.Member who comes from Mombasa, but he does not understand the importance of having roads in farming areas. He just stood up and talked and sang just like an ordinary, bird who has no| cage. When I am speaking here and an hon. Member stands up on a point of order which does not benefit anybody, he is just wasting	his time and mine also. when I stand, I stand like a bull; like a man; like a lion.

DEPUTY SPEAKER: I think it is now time for the Mover to reply.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MBORI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am very grateful, first to the Ministry of Transport and Communications for accep¬ting the Motion as it is, even though the argument developed by my colleague, the Assistant Minister, hon. arap Koech, was that the Motion was over taken by events. I would like to say that I moved the Motion quite early, perhaps, some technical problem arose in the office which was neither of his making nor mine. I would like to thank the Ministry for	Accepting to tarmac part of the road Sori-Rodi Kopany, which is 48 Kilometers long. We are grateful for that, but the Motion talked about the road from Oyugis via Rangwe to Rodi Kopany and down to Sori which is on the lake shore. I hope the Ministry is committed and will look for funds elsewhere, to be in a. position to cover the whole area so s that the highlands part of the road, which is potentially rich agriculturally, is equally covered,, .Bad roads affect both passengers and matatu operators equally badly.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, bad roads affect both passengers and matatu operators as vehicles break down frequently. The amount of tear and wear does equal the profits the y make. The passengers are affected most in the sense that matatu operators hike the fares to such a high extent that ordinary passengers cannot afford. I would like to appeal to the Ministry to look into that matter very carefully.I am equally grateful to my hon. friends who contributed and those who did not have the opportunity to say something but who took time to listen to the views expressed on this Motion. One of the speaker did say that if this road is constructed, it will be a security road. I am grateful for that important point. This road will be of strategic importance to Kenya, say, in case we have problems with the neighbouring country I am not making reference to any country right now it would play a very big role to the country. This road will also boost the tourism industry in Kenya. We do not only have tourist attractions in Lambwe Valley but also in Oyugis where we have a bird sanctuary called Oyugis Bird Sanctuary at Mbusira Kevra. If this road is tarmacked, it will boost the welfare of the people who live in this area.Since the Ministry has a positive attitude to this Motion,I just wish to stress that the Ministry should look into the remaining un¬tarmacked 33 kilometres, that is, 81 kilometres minus 48 kilometres. The Ministry should send its staff to survey that place and look for funds to tarmac it.With these few remarks,I beg to move</Newspeech>(Question put and agreed to) <Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Let us move on to the next Motion.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MUNYAO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move thefollowing Motion:-	THAT, in view of the fact that urbanization has brought about problems related to youth up-bringing which resulted in an existence of large numbers of delinquent children in big towns, (sometimes referred to as parking boys); this House urges the Government to check this trend by establishing homes for such unfortunate youths and raising funds during National Lays for their upkeep.I thank His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Home Affairs under whom this Motion falls for coming here personally and for notsending his Assistant Ministers to take notes for him. If the Motion isaccepted, it will be in line with what His Excellency the President hasbeen saying that Libya should bring back our parking boys who were taken therethrough Uganda for unknown training. He have so many parking ban boysin this country. Examples of towns where parking boys are found are Nairobi,Mombasa and a few others. Some of these children have either lost theirfather or mothers and in very extreme cases they may have lost both parents.As a result these children have nobody to take care of them and they finallyfind their way to big towns. These children have nothing to do other thansleep in Mathare, Kibera and on streets. At night, Sir, one cansympathetically see children moving about and some of them are usually naked.I remember one time I was passing near Uchumi House, which isopposite Kencom House, and I saw some children searching for food in garbagebins. These boys were saying; "waeha nichukue chakula hapa; babangu alikuwaakiendecha Mercedes Benz. Mamangu alikuwa anakaa nyumba hii." This kind of thing makes one feel so emotional. A nation like Kenya should be proudand take care of its people. It is my wish that at one time, Kenya willboast of having taken care of its children. I thank the Government for thework it has done in this respect. We know of Tumutumu Approve Schools and	many others. we hope that the .Minister for Finance will put into practisewhat he said when we were discussing a Motion about the disabled persons.It is also our wish that the items used by the disabled will not be taxed. I would like to thank His Excellency the President for the speecheshe has been giving with regard to the disabled. If this Motion is accepted,we would be the only nation south of the Sahara without anybody begging inthe streets due to lack of education. We have a lot of idle land and it is my view that the Government could spare about 10,000 acres 	 in Kajiado and other part of the Rift Valley, equip those places with all social amenities and collect all the orphaned children in the country and pat them in those homes. The established homes will then develop into primary schools, secondaryschools and even universities. Such homes should be given equipment like,tractors and other agricultural implement so that the admitted children can be given agricultural training. In this way, we will have overcome two problems at ago. The first one is that we shall educate these Kenyans who have lost their parents through no fault of their own. They will be educated from primary school up to university level. The other one is that when these children come out as trained officers, we will be in a position to over-come the problem of food shortage. I am assuming that these children will purely be trained in the line of agriculture, veterinary and other pro¬fessions which will benefit Kenya.We read in the Press at one time that Libya had collected parking boys from. Nairobi and elsewhere for mischievous training and purposes. This is very saddening. It may also suffice to enhance a statement which was made by His Excellency the President the other day that Kenya is able to take care of its nationals. I request Parliament to make a categorical statement to the effect that our neighbours who are giving our youths money to influence -them to start thinking otherwise, should lay their hands off Kenya. This is because Kenya is a nation which is very strong and which can support its people adequately. We are able to support our own country. There is no other country in Africa which is as strong as Kenya, and that is why we have become the envy of all Africa. We are suffering because we have done very well in projecting our own image. Indeed, we have done so to an extent that our neighbours and many other countries are envying us. My only appeal to those countries is that they cool down and organise their own economies so that they could be like ours. Our interest is to see Africa uniting together just as we have united Kenya. It is for this reason that we, as a Parliament, should support His Excellency the President's word that Col. Gaddafi should be told, wherever he is, that we are able to take care of our boys. There should be no stealing of human beings from Kenya. Let Col. Gaddafi come here and our country will take care of him.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is my feeling that if the Ministry of Lands and Settlement could be approached to set aside some parcels of land in the areas I have mentioned for the construction of rehabilitation and training institutions for the delinquent children all over the country, that would serve a very good purpose. We could train the children in .agricultural matters properly, something that will help them a lot.Sir, I know that the Vice-President and Minister for Home Affairs willask how we are going to sponsor and finance these institutions, and I would liketo say that I have already indicated that we have several nation holidays in Kenya, during which I propose that money be collected to support the institutions. We have Madaraka Day, Kenyatta Day and Jamhuri Day. On top of that, according to a Motion passed by this House not too long ago, the Government will set aside a day to be designated Moi Day which will be a national holiday. When that is done, we shall have four national holidays every year in this country. Since we are proud of our Harambee spirit in Kenya, if everybody dims donated a shilling to this worthy cause, we would be able to collect between KShs.8 million and KShs.10 million every national holiday. In total, assuming that we collect a minimum of KShs.8 mil¬lion during every national holiday, we would be able to collect KShs.32 million per year. This money, added to the contributions given by voluntary organisations suchas the Lions Club of Kenya, the Jaycees and others, we would get enough money to run the proposed institutions. In any case, the Government would be giving something every year to make sure that the institutions are well managed.Mr. Deputy Speaker. Sir, there is nothing better than an organised nation. We are organised in all sectors. We now want to make sure that our streets are clear of these boys who have no parents.Sir, I am aware of another question that His Excellency the Vice-Presidentand Minister for Home Affairs may pose to us, that we have no law to force theseboys to go to the proposed rehabilitation and training centres. Let these boys be collected from wherever they are and be taken to these institutions. They can be allowed to go out once in a year, as long as they are known ate and as long as we can be able to train their minds to make them good nationals. That is the only way we can be proud of having a nation where no youth under the age of 18 years does not go to school. In any case, there is a rule that everybody who gets to school age must attend school. So, we can enforce the training of these parking boys under that rule. I was saying those few words because we must support thepolicies already projected by our Government. If we succeed in this programme, then we will be the first country in Africa to have everybody of school ago going to school. Those boys will come out fully trained as professionals in agriculture and other fields.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, since I want other hon. Members to contribute to this Motion which I feel is very important, and since I have already highlighted the most important points I wanted to cover, I might as well stop there and ask hon. Wamalwa to second the Motion.With those few remarks, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAMALWA: Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me a chance to second this very important Motion. Let me state from the outset that thi6 Motion is not asking for a totally new thing in Kenya. In fact, the spirit of social concern is very much alive and strong in this country. The Ministry of HomeAffairs, under the Vice-President’s Office, already look after many social institut¬ions that cater for the less privileged members of our society.In any country, the two groups of people that require the greatest social assistance are the youngsters who have matured in terms of being able to look after themselves and getting jobs for themselves and who, quite often, therefore,run the risk of turning into juvenile delinquents. The second group is the agedpeople who, having retired, cannot look after themselves any more. This group couldvery easily fall into another description of senile delinquents. I do believe that it is the moral obligation for any government, properly so-called, to show concern and to be actively involved in the roc welfare of these two groups of people. The Kenyan nation is an exemplary Government as far as these two groups of people are concerned and, I believe, what this Motion is asking is simply that the Ministry of Home Affairs, under the Vice-President's Office, enlarges the programme to spread it but to most parts of the country. Also, the Motion is seeking for the opening of new boys' homes in the city of Nairobi as well.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is important, particularly where the infants are concerned I am using the word "infant" in a legalistic manner to point at those who have not achieved the age of the majority and joined the labour market and not in the medical sense that they be given due care because of the attendant risks of neglect. The lots of infants who are neglected can no longer be described as non-neglect because it carries elements of a dangerous situation in the sense that those children who do not have an approximation of parental love in the form of an institutional love will grow up as mean people who feel that the whole world is against them and that to survive they have to be mean, rough and tough. If a little concern, care and love was shown to such infants, they would probably realise that they have grown up in a world where people cared for them and are expected to care for others.This sort of thing is described in the proverbial writing on the wall of one the pyramids outside Cairo. The writing says in Arabic, "And nobody cared”. That maxim says a lot. It says that there is so much going wrong with the lot of people who cannot look after themselves, and nobody cared.I believe that we are a caring nation, as we have demonstrated many times, and that we will intensify our spiritual caring by looking after the youngsters who are growing up in town now and who, for no fault of their own, do not have parents to look after them. Urban areas are the breeding grounds of this class of people, firstly, because of the laxity in the morals of the people in the city which is brought upon them by all kinds of influence, both local and foreign. It is in these towns that young ladies, for the sake of looking after themselves, have dropped any expectation of ever getting married. So, they fulfill their natural urge of producing children without any hope of getting spouses to look after them. So, they become both the mothers and the "fathers" of these children0 Quite often, these ladies fail to look after these children0 There is also the case of unwed mothers who try very hard to look after their children. Once these children, especially if they are boys, reach the age of puberty, they automatically rebel against their mothers control, take to the streets and engage themselves in all kinds of unlawlessness.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it would be a wonderful idea to expand this programme of social welfare homes in the City of Nairobi and other big metropolises such as, Mombasa, Kisumu, and so on, and in all the small towns, too. There is an old lady near Ngong who has started her own children's welfare home. I saw a programme on this home on television sometime back. The lady has about 10 children that she looks after, and they engage in all kinds games and other activities, such as, cultivating the garden, growing vegetables, selling their produce, and so on. Apart from asking the Ministry of Home Affairs to intensify this programme, I would also take this opportunity to appeal to Kenyans of good will to do what this lady in Ngong is doing for unfortunate children.In Kitale, where I come from, there is now a growing population ofespecially Turkana children who have refused to go to school and who roam thetown asking for a shilling, 50 cents, and so on. We have requested theMunicipality of Kitale to look into the possibility of starting a home for these children. We are quite sure that Kenyans would be forthcoming in terms of contributions towarding enabling us to look after these children, instead of seeing them get totally derailed at this early stage of their lives.I think the idea canvassed by the hon0 Mover of this Motion, that tracts of land be set aside where institutions could be built to cater for the education and upkeep of these children, is very sound. I would go further and suggest that a "kibbutz" type of idea such as they have in Israel, where youngsters-are taken and engaged in education and agriculture by irrigation, would be a very useful example to borrow. I think that if these institutions are set up in our marginal lands where irrigation is possible but none is being undertaken at the moment, these children could be very gainfully employed, and the spirit of nationalism nurtured in them so that they grow up as Kenyans who can also make a positive contribution to the development of this country,, This idea is not totally far-fetched, Mr0 Deputy Speaker, Sir, In Garissa, there is a "Boys Town" which was started by an Italian missionary, called Brother Mario„ Brother Mario's "Boys Town" in Garissa took in delinquent or potentially delinquent children. He gave them love and also engaged them in active agricultural activities. The Garissa melons are very well known in this country today. These children have produced a lot of horticultural products inthat "Boys Town" which has proved extremely successful.Such a project would be an interesting experiment for Kenya toundertake if land was set aside in marginal areas and sufficient funds wereraised, either through the K usual Kenyan generosity of Harambee, through donoragencies or otherwise to set up a “kibbutz” we could start off with one "kibbutz”,and we do not have to call it a “kibbutz” where these children could be taken,educated, fed, looked after medically and, eventually, engaged in productiveagricultural activities,,As I have said, it is incumbent upon the conscience of any nation to look after its people, particularly those classes of people who are incapable, or cannot look after themselves,, In line with these sentiments, I believe that this Motion although it is not calling for anything drastically new; it is calling for an intensification of what we already have in this country is most timely. This n facility of looking after 6ur socially less fortunate people should be expanded and strengthened.With these few words, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to second.</Newspeech>(Question proposed)<Newspeech>MRS. ASIYO: Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to support this very timely Motion by hon. Munyao. I would like to congratulate him for the ideas that he expresses and the concern he has shown towards the youth who form the majority of our populace. I would also like to congratulate hon. Wamalwa very much for some of those very authentic and original ideas that he has expressed today with regard to this Motion.I think our Government has done a great deal in terms of theprovision of health to children from the time before they are born to the timethey cease to be children. The Government also spends a lot of money in theeducation of our children in many other services that it renders not only tochildren, but also to the families who take care of these children. However,there is still much more to be done in this regard. Hopefully the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Home Affairs, which is concerned with children,will take some of our views seriously and do something about them.So far, we know that Non-Government at Organisations (N.G.O.'s), such as the Child Vie If are Society of Kenya, the Faith Homes in Eldoret and elsewhere, S.O.S. children's villages and the African Independent Church and other churches are giving a lot of assistance to the youth of this country. However, as I said earlier, much more still remains to be done. Many social workers in this country have expressed their concern about the future of these children. Infact, when "parking hoys" were so evident in Nairobi, most of us were veryconcerned and we came up with some very good ideas about how they should lietaken care of. We knew then, as we know even today, that the devil will findwork for idle hands. This is exactly what Libya and President Museveni of Uganda have done. We cannot go on exposing our children to these evil people who have taken away our children and dehumanised them. They have even brutalised the children and taught them how to kill. These are innocent children who should be brought up within their home background, loved, educated and otherwise prepared for their future lives.I think these two countries, Libya and Uganda, stand condemned, notonly in the eyes of the hon. Members of Parliament in this House, but also in the eyes of the international community for dehumanising, brutalising and demoralising our children to the extent that they can no longer be useful either to themselves, their families or their nation which, I am store, they  loved very much before they were taken away by these two evil men, Gaddafi and Museveni. Therefore, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we want to emphasize here that problemsaffecting our children cannot wait like you would pick up a file and then push itaside hoping to get the tine to look at it later. The problems affecting ourchildren cannot be made to wait because these children are growing very fast all the timeand therefore, the first attention must be given to them because they are the bestresources that ire have in this country. Therefore, all the investment that we haveto make in this country must be made in these children in the way that ourown President has done. Not only normal children need education, but even those or mentallywho are physically or mentally disabled require to be educated. I think His Excellencythe President, as hon. Munyao said, has shown us the way and it is up to us, in thisHouse and in the Government to fellow his footsteps by implementing some of theideas that he himself has originated, and others that have emanated from this House.I agree entirely that we should have farms where these children should be trained,but I would like to pass a word of caution here, that even where children are beingtaken care of very well in those institutions, they do lack something else. What they lack can only be given by a mother or a father or a close relative. I am saying this because we want to bring up these children within their traditional as well as cultural values. If these children are not given the tame to go back home and interact with the members of their families, they	 will have lost this very important aspect of their national development. Therefore, much as I feel that the ideas expressed in this Motion are very useful, I must also say that the children after every three months on these institutions, should be able to go back home and stay with the members of their families, so that they can be part and parcel of those families.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is also the question of the mothers of these children. I think the time has come when too mothers of these children must be given some assistance even in the form of loans to be able to protect these children and bring thorn up on behalf of the Government. After all, this country is accountable for every single child who is born. Therefore, through these mothers, I am sure that a great deal of good can be done, if they can be helped to feed cloth and educate their children.  Another area which I would like to touch on, Mr. Deputy Speaker, is the area ofyouth, polytechnics. I think there is need now to establish a foundation or atrust for all the youth polytechnics in this country which would solutionenable them to pay the teachers and also expand youth programmes in these polytechnics. A lot has been said in this House about the staff salaries in these youth polytechnics and hon. Members have expressed the fears that many of the administrators have regarding the problems of the youth, polytechnics. I think within the framework of this Motion, we can also suggest that a foundation be set up at the highest position possible by the Ministry concerned with children affairs so, that they can get the necessary funds with which, to carry out all the good work that is being done.I am saying this because we know only a small fraction of the children are affected by this Motion. He know that quite a good number of children drop out after Standard VIII, but we do not know what happens to those who do not continue with education. By the time a child has gone to Standard VIII he or she is already aware of his or her hygienic needs and, if the child cannot get the money for food is unable to dress properly, any other means to get the money is acceptable to the child in orderto provide himself with these requirements. Therefore, unless we do somethingfor that child now, it will be too late, just as we have witnessed how late wehave been in rehabilitating the parking boys. If in the Office of the Vice-Presidentand ministry of Home Affairs, action had been taken to take these children awayfrom streets and put them somewhere in the farms or in lie youth polytechnics,nobody would have reached them and taken them out of this country to utilize themon teach then certain things that they have now been taught. There is no way that you can now vise to bring these children back to lead a normal, human beings life and to learn how to love their mothers again and how to cherish their fathers and their traditional values and so on. I think we are too late in this and there is no tiling we can do about it', it is a spilt milk issue, but for those children who are innocent and still suffering, action must be taken now to safe them.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I said before, and I want to repeat it again,all other things can wait, but children's problems cannot be made to wait. With those few remarks, I support the Motion.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KOSKE: Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving methis opportunity to also contribute to this very important Motion. First if all,Sir, I would, like to thank the lion. Mover of this Motion for bringing this veryimportant Motion to the House.Having said that, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to say that itis very pathetic to see the way these destitute children behave, and it is alsovery discouraging indeed to note how the rata of their population growth is rising.It is very discouraging to note how undisciplined these children are. Sir, thisis not only happening in the City of Nairobi here, but you will find that the numberof destitute children in other towns as well, is rising. The way these childrenapproach foreigners and visitors is most unbecoming and something really oughtto be done at all costs possible.Mr. Deputy Speakers, Sir, it is also very discouraging, as a parent wholoves children, to see these children going without food all the time and to seesons of them eating rotten food. I think it is our duty to make sure that thesechildren are assisted in everyday possible and Government ought really to come outand look for ways and means of assisting these children. Something really shouldbe done about these children. They should be put together somewhere and givenspecial education. I am saying this because I believe that there is something wrongwith these children and they cannot actually be given the normal education that wegive to normal children. Therefore, a special educational curriculum should be established for these children.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, these children are doing what they are doingnot because, .their parents are not able to support them. Some of them have able parents but they have got out of their hands and cannot be assisted. They run away from their homes and start coving around the way they are doing. It is true to say that some of them gat astray from their parents for lack of food, proper care and other facilities and have now been forced to behave in the way they are now behaving. So, it is quite correct to say that if some of these children were assisted, they would turn to be normal children, and therefore, something shouldbe dons to assist them.With those few remarks, I beg to support the Motion.</Newspeech> <Header>ADJOURNMENT</Header><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon. Members, it is now time for the interruption of business and the House is therefore adjourned until this afternoon at 2.30 p.m.</Newspeech> The House rose at thirty minutes Past Twelve o'clock HANSARDWednesday, 16th December, 1987 The House met at thirty minutes past Two o'clock.Mr. Speaker in the Chair PRAYERS <Header>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</Header> Question No.807MR. WAKIONDO asked the Minister of State, Office of the President:-(a)	whether he is aware that Mr. Mathew  	Inoti of P.O. Sox 1631, Meru, aformer employee of D.C's Office, Meru, Personal No.181111, retired in 1984 but has not been paid his pension benefits; and(b)	 whether he would order that Mr. Inoti be paid his benefitswithout any further delay.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Onyancha): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Mr. Mathew Inoti, whose Personal Number is 181112 and not 181111, was working in the District Commissioner's Office, Meru, as a member of the subordinate staff until he retired from the Service with effect from 31st May, 1985. On his retirement, he was entitled to a compassionate gratuity which is payable to officers of his grade, and not pension gratuity. My information reveals that his compassionate gratuity was paid to him through cheque No.031227 for Sh.22,272/50 and the cheque was dated 9th June, 1987 and was to pass through the District Commissioner's Office, Meru. He is now advised to check with that office if he has not already received the cheque.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAKIONDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Assistant Minister for that reply, but is it in order that when this retired officer has been in the cold for some time, it is only after the Question was put forward that he was paid? Would the Assistant Minister, therefore, rectify the situation in his office?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not sure what is left for me to rectify; we have already done so by paying out the cheque.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, would the Assistant Minister not agree with me that it was only after the hon. Questioner brought this Question to this House that his officers woke up and gave the cheque he has mentioned this year? I thought I heard him say November, this year? Could he explain to the House why they have done injustice to this man from 1984 when he retired, and they are paying him in 1987yand they are not paying him any interest? This is very absurd on the part of his office.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not sure that my colleague is right because the cheque was paid in June not November.</Newspeech>	Question No.793<Newspeech>MR. MATE asked the Minister forEnvironment and Natural Resources:-(a)	approximately how many treeseedlings have been planted in Gachoka and Siakago Divisions of Embu District for the past three	years;(b)	what the survival rate of these tree seedlings have been and whether he is happy with this rate; and (c) 	if the answer to the second part of ("b) is in the negative, what immediate steps he is going to take to improve the survival rate of the tree seedlings in the dry areas.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES (Mr. Korellach): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(a)	A total of about 1,584,080 seedlings have been planted in Gachoka and Siakago Divisions of Embu District during the last three years.	(b)	The Minister is informed that the survival rate has been approximately 65 per cent.(c)	The survival rate is unfortunately low due to a number of reasons, such as:-(i)	Drought conditions caused by lack of sufficient rain in the area.	(ii)	The area has a lot of termites which destroy tree seedlings and other shamba crops such as maize, peas,et cetera.(iii)	The other cause is the lack of fencing aroundand as a result, goats and other animals have aroused and devoured the seedlings.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MATE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to differ with my great friend because the survival rate of trees in that area, according to very good information which I have is 2 per cent and not 65 per cent. To me, it could be a futile exercise if every year, we plant trees and most of them die because of lack of water and other facilities and other evils which have been mentioned the Assistant Minister. So, could the Ministry consider first of all,providing water I hear one Minister here saying that we shouldwater them, but there is no water in the area for watering them.Therefore, could he first of all, consider providing water there rather than doing a useless exercise where the survival rate of tree seedlings is only 2 per cent?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KORELLACH: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have given the reasons and it is appreciated that this area is one of those dry areas in the country and water is not easily available. But every effort is being made to water seedlings in some areas wherever water is available that is if the water is available. The best thing is to educate wananchi that whenever there is water, they should try to water the seedlings and also to make sure that they provide fences around these tree seedlings.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MATE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think we are talking the same language with my friend, the hon. Assistant Minister that there is no water. My bone of contention is: Could the Ministry provide water before even planting these trees? Again, he has been misled there where he says that the survival rate is 65 per cent when I have said that it is about 2 per cent if anything.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KORELLACH: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the hon. Member agrees that we are talking the same language, especially on the fact that this is a dry area and it is not easy to find water,it is agreed that whenever water is available, this can be done. But, when the water is not available, then there is nothing we can do, save to educate wananchi to do their best just like our Ministry is doing its best.</Newspeech> Question No.769<Newspeech>MR. GACHANJA asked the Minister for LocalGovernment:-(a)	whether he is aware of the existence of a very bad smell around Dagoretti Market which if not eliminated will risk the lives of the residents of this area; and(b)	what steps he is taking to eliminate this smell.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT(Mr. Marita): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.I am aware that there is a very bad smell around Dagoretti Market due to the poor maintenance of the butcheries. The City Commission has already served the owners of the premises with 30 days notice to avert the nuisance, failure of which will lead to closing down of the premises.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. GACHANJA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Assistant Minister has said that the Nairobi City Commission has sent noticesto the butchers But what part is the City Commission playingitself to make sure that these butcheries are clean? I ask t his because the City Commission is also charging these butchers money.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MARITA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the responsibility of maintaining cleanliness around this area, where butchers do their work is their own. There is no question of the City Commission going there to make the place clean for these butchers.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. GACHANJA: But, Mr. Speaker, Sir,</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order! I have not called you.Mr. Lotitiyo.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. LOTITIYO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister say she something about butcheries in other towns? This is because the same conditions prevail in Maralal Town. Can the Assistant Minister give a general directive to these local authorities so that these butcheries and slaughterhouses are cleaned and their conditions improved?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MARITA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I agree with the sentiments expressed by the hon. Member. But I would like to say that any businessman who does not keep his premises clean will face action from the Government. The Government will take action against such businessmen. So, these people have to keep their premises clean.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. GACHANJA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, is it really fair for the Nairobi City Commission to exonerate itself from any responsi¬bility in this City? Is their responsility only that of collecting rents and rates and nothing else?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MARITA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, a lot of services are being rendered by the Nairobi City Commission. So, it is not right for the hon. Member to claim that the Nairobi City Commission is not rendering any services in this City.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAEER: Let us move on to hon. Muthura's Question.</Newspeech>Question No.745<Newspeech>MR. MWACHOFI, on behalf of Mr. Muthura, asked theMinister for Labour:-(a)	whether he is aware that civil servants who are being retired prematurely before attaining, the age of 55 years cannot withdraw their N.S.S.F. benefits; and(b)	what steps he is taking to help these wananchi.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. Okondo): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(a)	I am aware that civil servants who retire before attaining the age of 55 years do not receive their N.S.S.F. withdrawal benefits because under the operative law this is not permissible.(b)	As the hon. Member is already aware, Parliamentpassed a law recently amending the National Social Security Actwhich permits retiring members to withdraw their benefits at the age of 50 years of age instead of 55 years. I am at present in the process of making arrangements to implement the amended law effectively. I hope I will be able to do with effect from 1st January, 1983.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWACHOFI: Mr.; Speaker, Sir, while thanking the hon. Minister for that reply, I would like him to tell the House how many members of the N.S.S.F. who qualify to be paid their benefits have so far not been paid in time and how much money is involved?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKONDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, in as much as I would like to please the hon. Member, that question is completely different from the one hon. Muthura asked and I cannot agree to answer it at the present moment.</Newspeech>	 <Newspeech>MR. MWACHOFI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a bit sad that the Minister does not want to answer that particular part of my question. But I would like him to tell the House why, when the law was amended, it was amended up to the age of 50 years when in fact in the Kanu Parliamentary Group meeting we agreed that people should be paid their N.S.S.F. benefits immediately they retire irrespective what their ages are?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKONDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the question here is not what the hon. Member wants me to tell the House, but rather what is lawful and necessary to tell the House. I will tell the House what is lawful and necessary. When the Bill was presented to this House, it was very clearly written and published, that the age would be 50 years. We debated that Bill here for a long time. We agreed on it and passed it. So, we cannot, at the moment, with due respect to the hon. Member start another debate as to why it was 50 years and not 45 years. That debate passed, and I am not prepared to start another debate on it.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Next Question. Mr. Shikuku.</Newspeech>Question No.8l6<Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU asked the Minister for Labour:-(a)	Why M/S. Alfonse Muhunzu and Walter Okong'o of City Garden Restaurant were sacked on 19.10.87; and(b)	whether the said employees had been paid their three months salaries before dismissal.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LAB0UR (Mr. Okondo): Mr.: Speaker, Sir, you will excuse me because the reply is a bit long. But I think I should give a detailed reply.	(a) Mr. W. Okong'o went on leave on 4th September, 1987 and resumed duty on 1st October, 1987. At that time, that day, he learnt that the police had been, investigating thefts of restaurant property during his absence and that his name was being implicated in the investigations. He then disappeared from duty that same day and he has never gone back since. So, Mr. Okong'o was never dismissed but rather absconded from duty.Mr. Muhunzu, on the other hand, was dismissed on 16th October, 1987, for persistent absenteeism and for late reporting to work persistently. He had been issued with withree warning letters on the matter.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am reading out this reply because this is a very protracted issue.(b) Mr. Okong’o's September salary was paid by Mrs. Khan who was managing the restaurant that month. His August salary was paid by the current manageress Mrs. Scot. He did not work for October, 1987 and as such no salary was due to him.I will now go back to Mr. Muhunzu again. His salary for September was paid by Mrs. Khan and for August he was paid KShs. 1,550.00 as advance leaving a balance of KShs.950.00. The balance together with pay for the 13 days worked in October brings his dues to KShs.2,198.00. During August and October he was absent for a total of 96 hours, which, at the rate of KShs.12.00 per hour comes to KShs.1,152.00. So the balance of his dues is KShs.1,046.00 which has been deposited with the Labour Officer, Nairobi. This money will be paid to him when he returns the uniforms he is holding in his possession at present. The uniforms are estimated to be worth KShs.3,765/- and made up as follows:2 suits	- KShs.3,500.002 shirts	- KShs. 190.001 neck-tie	- KShs. 75.00.So, this adds up to KShs.3,765.00. That is the position as we have it at present.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: Arising from that long reply, which is in defence of the employer and which is normal to us will the Minister lay on the Table the papers he has referred to? He has said that the employee had been served with three warning letters. We want to know he was warned from what date to what date, because this lady is very famous in doing very tricky things. Even now she is supposed to be in jail, but she is not. She is capable of doing anything. Canhe lay those papers on the Table?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKONDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, obviously, ladies are capable of doing many things; they are so capable of doing them that hon. Shikuku is here. So, we cannot dispute the capacity of ladies to do a lot of things, and she is not inhibited either. She has got a terrific amount of capacity; that is why she runs the restaurant successfully, and also doing all sorts of things.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was not expected to produce copies of letters of warning, but, in anticipation of my hon. friend's ubiquitiveness, I did bring them forward. If the hon. Member would like to have a look at them, I will them here on the Table to show that he got three letters of warning and a salary slip going along with them. So, the hon. Member can have a look at and read them; they have the dates and the figures.</Newspeech>(Hon. Okondo laid the papers on the Table)<Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: Arising from that reply and the Minister knowing that I am capable of leaving this place, looking at those papers and then asking a supplementary question, could he be kind enough as to read the dates of those letters? I cannot read them now and then ask a supplementary question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKONDO: Mr. Speaker, I have laid the letters on the Table; he can read them. All of them are long; some of them are giving names. So, they can be read by the hon. Member.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWARUWA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, could the hon. Minister tell this House where he got all that information and how he got it? Was the employee there when this information was being given, or was it given by only one party?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKGITDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the employee does not keep records of hisemployment; these arc kept by the employer. There is no employee who keeps a master-roll on how often he attends for duty; but the employer writes down every time the employee reports for duty. When every employee who goes into a factory picks up a clocking card and clocks in. But he himself does not keep a clocking card. So,that is the case here. It is true that some employers play tricks on wananchi, but this Ministry is not tolerating that sort of situation. The Nyayo Government is for the simple man or worker. That is why this Government looks specially after the interests of the small man or employee. But this excludes rascals. Mr. Speaker, Sir, a joint meeting was called by the Labour Officer, Nairobi at which Mr. Muhunzu was invited to attend at 2.30, but Mr. Muhunzu did not turn up at the meeting.</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: Why?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKONDO: Well, you can tell me why he did not turn up. Subsequently, he came and complained that he did not know that the employer was coming to the meeting. This was irrelevant because the labour officer had told him to come and have a joint meeting with his employer. Mr. Muhunzu would be well advised by the hon. Member to call on the Labour Officer, Nairobi, so that they can go to the employer's office and discuss whatever matter he has against the employer. However, it appears to me that Mr. Muhunzu is dodging a bit.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHUKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I am wondering whether the Minister was in order in the course of responding to my supplementary question to refuse to read to the House the dates of those warning letters. Was he in order to refuse to do that?</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. SPEAFCKR: Yes, he was very much in order. The papers are available and you can check if you want.	(Mr. Shikuku made some remarks while sitting down)Mr. Shikuku, I have to warn you. I can hear you very clearly. The people Surrounding you are people who will not tolerate the kind of remarks you are making.</Newspeech>Question No. 770<Newspeech>MR. WAGURA asked the Minister for Health:-(a)	how many health centres are operational in Nyandarua North Constituency;	(e)	how many are not operational; and(f)	how many the Ministry is going to construct in the constituency during this financial year.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Muthamia): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I begto reply.(a) Five health centres are functional in Nyandarua North Constituency; namely, Mwangi and Maina, Mirangini, Leshau Pondo, Njabini and Uanjohi Health Centres. (b) There are no health centres in Nyandarua North Constituency that are not operational.(c) The Ministry has no plans to construct new health centres in Nyandarua North Constituency during the current financial year. But there are two dispensaries in Nyandarua North Constituency currently under construction, namely, Turaaini and Nevr Mawingo Dispensaries. The first one has been allocate £15,000 and the second one has been allocated £30,000.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAGURA: While I thank the Assistant Minister for a part of the answer that he has given, he has misled the House. In the first place Njabini and Wanjohi Health Centres are not in Nyandarua North. Can the Assistant Minister now give the correct number of dispensaries and health centres in Nyandarua North Constituency</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTHAMIA: Mr. Speaker, you can then reduce then by two</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAGURA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister should not take the House for a ride. I am telling him that Njabini and Wanjohi Health Centres are not in Nyandarua North. Can he give us the correct figure of the health centres in Nyandarua North?</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. MUTHAMIA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I had given five, and he is insisting that two of these five health centres are in Nyandarua South, then that leaves three health centres in Nyandarua North.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAGURA: On a point order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order! No! Mr. Kisuya's Question.</Newspeech>Question No. 808MR. KISUYA asked the Minister for Education why Mr. Timothy W. Musee, T.S.C. No. 20711/50, retired before attaining! the mandatory retirement age.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. M'maitsi): Mr. Speaker, Sir, Ibeg to reply.Mr. Timothy Wanyaaia Musee, T.S.C. No. 20711; P3 certificate No. T3/59/2981, was correctly retired on 1st May, 1937 by the. Teachers Service Commission after attaining the mandatory age of 55 years. Furthermore, during his first appointment by Nakuru County Council in January, I960, Mr. Musee gave his official date of birth as 1932, and hence this is the official date of his birth as clearly recorded in the Teachers Service Commission Computer Bi-product, and which is strictly adhered to when retiring teachers.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KISUYA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not know where the Assistant Minister got his information from because according to the old identity card which was given to him in 1958 - K/TN 2359 - and also the new identity card, they both tally with the same time. He was born in 1940. How come that he was retired before the retire¬ment age? Both the old and the new identity card show that he was born in 1940.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. M'MAITSI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the problem which this teacher has created himself, and he has not given the hon. Member the correct information. As from January, I960, he was employed by Nakuru County Council under the Roman Catholic Church Management. His official records maintained by the Teachers Service Commission (T.S.C.) indicate that at his own accord and voluntarily, he indicated that he was born in 1932 in Elgon Nyanza District, MLuhya by tribe, and of Catholic Religion. The history given by the teacher at the time of his first appointment determines his future records which is clearly reflected in the T.S.C. Computer By-products, and it is strictly followed, as I said, when we are retiring teachers. Records also held by the T.S.C. show that the service of this teacher Timothy Wanyama Musee T.S.C. No.20711 - gave three different dates of birth.As explained above, Mr. Speaker, Sir, during his first appointment by the Nakuru County Council in January, 1960, he gave his date of birth as 1932. Secondly, when he transferred his services to the T.S.C. in 1967, he gave his date of birth as 14th February, 1934. Thirdly, on the T.S.C. records sheet which he signed on 13th February, 1980, he gave his date of birth as 10th January, 1940.I have already explained the correct date which was recorded in the T.S.C. Computed By-product, and which, as a rule, is adhered to when retiring teachers from the service. This, is the date which this teacher gave during his first appointment which was 1932.Mr. Speaker, Sir, Mr. Timothy Wanyama Musee, T.S.C. No. 20711, was,therefore,correctly retired on 1st May, 1987 by the T.S.C. after attaining the mandatory retirement age of 55 years.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTISO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. While listening to the Assistant Minister, it does seem to me that this contradicting information was either verbal or hand written. Could he clarify whether when somebody is being employed he does not give his identity card which shows the date of birth which is shown there since the time he took his identity card? Was this information obtaine from the identity card, or was it just verbal information?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. M'MAITSI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would say that even when I brought my identity card, those clerks merely wrote "over 18 years". They may not have written I was born in 1934 or 1932. They merely wrote "over 18 years". But what I have explained here is what he gave himself and what he has put down and signed.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MBORI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is not yet very clear from the Assistant Minister's reply because since Kenyans became registered every person gives the most correct date of his birth. Now, could he tell us whetrher this teacher had his identity card which would indicat when he was born so that that could be taken as the most correct record</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. M'MAITSI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think this teacher gave his identity card number. When he finished his teacher training course, he was entered into a register and his age was also determined. According to his own statement on the first appointment, we have determined and processed his retirement benefits based on that record. The Treasury has paid him and he is on pension now. So, the T.S.C. cannot re-employ him.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Next Question, Mr. Muia.</Newspeech>Question No . 788<Newspeech>MR. MUNYAO, on behalf of Mr. Muia, asked the Minister for Water Development:-(a)how many storage water tanks are earmarked in the Kilimanjaro Water Scheme to be built between Sultan Hamud and Machakos Town; and(b)if he can assure this Mouse that the Kilima¬njaro pipeline will be extended to serve the people of Kasikcu Location, Nunguni, Malani, Kasunguni, Kalama, Ndolo and Upete.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR WATER DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Mwendwa): Mr. Speaker,Sir, I beg to reply.(a)It is planned to construct one big storage tank between Sultan Hamud and Machakos Town. This reservoir will be located at Kiima Kiu area.(b)Residents and their livestock living within the Kilimanjaro pipeline route will be supplied with water. The pipeline passes through kasikeu Location, Nunguni, Mayani, Kasunguni, Kalama, Ndolo and Upete. Demand for water for the residents of these areas will, therefore, be catered for.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUNYAO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the hon. Questioner and Ukambani people, I would like to thank the Minister for his direct answer. But in part (b) of the Question, in his reply he has said "Mayani". Would he confirm whether this is the same as "Maiyani" we are talking about, or it is a different one? Could he also confirm or deny the rumour that already there exists a problem with the Kilimanjaro Water Scheme?</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: What problem?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWENDWA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is the same "Mayani". It is just the question of pronouncing "y" as "i". As regards the rumour, I must confess that I have not heard of it.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: We move on to Questions by Private Notice.</Newspeech><Header>QUESTIONS BY PRIVATE NOTICE</Header><Newspeech>MR. MUTISO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister forLands and Settlement the following Question by Private Notice.(a)Is the Minister aware that since 1968 allowances for the eldersof land arbitration cases has been only KSh.75/- per day?(b)In view of the present High cost of living, would he consider raising this allowance as a matter of urgency?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANES AND SETTLEMENT (Mr. Muturia): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. (a) I am aware that the allowance for the elders who sit to hear land arbitration cases has not been reviewed since 1968.(b) Consultations are in progress to review upwards the current rate of allowance for the elders who sit in land arbitration boards.</Newspeech>	.	.<Newspeech>MR. MUTISO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, arising from that inadequate answer from the Assistant Minister, could he be specific and tell the House exactly the progress of this review because the question of allowance to these arbitration elders is very important? In fact, they are open to bribery and corruption. Many people are losing land because these people do not earn anything. Can he tell the House how soon this review is likely to come up, and with how much?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTURIA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, with all due respect to the hon. Member for Yatta, I have already indicated that there are some consultations taking place. We are looking for ways and means of raising the allowances paid to the elders. It is only a matter of giving us time and the hon. Member will be very happy.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Let us move on to Mr. Munyao's Questionby Private Notice.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTJYAO: Mr. Speaker Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Health the following Question by Private Notice.(a) Is the Minister aware that two vehicles, a Land Rover and an ambulance, allocated to Masii Health Centre were withdrawn last month?(b) Why were they withdrawn?(c) Could the Minister order that they be returned immediately since they are urgently needed?</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. arap Chehoiwo): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(a)I am aware that a Land Rover G.k. 84IT was taken to a garage for repairs. There was however, an ambulance at Masii Health Centre. This was done a long time ago and not last month as the hon. Member has alleged.(b)The vehicles were not withdrawn as the hon. Member has again alleged. The Land Rover was taken to Cooper Motors Corporation for repairs (C.M0C.).(c) The vehicles was returned to Masii Health Centre on Monday, 14th December, 1987.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUNYAO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I partially thank the  Assistant Minister, but why had they to wait until a Question was brought to this House before returning the vehicle?There is however, a need for an ambulance because this 	is a high-way and due to the high rate of accidents taking place there people have to be rushed to Machakos District Hospital. Will the Assistant Minister assure this House that along with this Land Rover which  serves	the area that he will return the ambulance which is very badly needed at Masii Health Centre?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. arap CHEBOIWO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I said earlier on in my reply, there was no ambulance last month at Masii Health Centre. It was there some time back.As a matter of fact, the Land Rover has not been permanently attached to Masii Health Centre. The Health Centre gets assistance from Machakos District Hospital which is only 18 kilometres away. There was an ambulance at the Health Centre in 1981. It was a Chevrolet, G.K. 0I72, which was loaned to Makindu Sub-District Hospital the same year. It however, broke down and was taken to a garage where it has been lying since 1981, and you can imagine what a long time that is. Makindu Sub-District Hospital had another Chevrolet vehicle which used to break down quite often. It is   recorded that spare parts were obtained from the Chevrolet at Masii and used 	to repair the vehicle at Makindu and that is why the one at Masii Health Centre has never been repaired.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have issued instructions for theambulance to be bonded because it is not serviceable any more. Since we are, however, receiving a lot of generous donations from foreign countries, the Masii Health Centre will be considered when we get one of the new ambulances.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWACHOFI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister has told the House that this vehicle has been in the garage from 1981 until today. That is a period of about seven years. Can he tell the House why such public property should have been left                                                   There is however, a need for an ambulance because thisis a high-way and due to the high rate of accidents taking place there people have to be a rushed to Machakos District Hospital.

Can he tell the House why such public property should have been left rotting in the garage for seven years? Why did his Ministry allow that to happen when wananchi were suffering?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. arap CHEBOIwO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, there were two problems; this being a Chevrolet, it has not been easy to get its spare parts we have been looking for them. The other problem has been money. It is not only this vehicle which has lacked spare parts. There are so many others not only in the Ministry of Healthy which have stayed for a very long without being re pained because of lack of funds throughout the Republic.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. SPEAEER: Let us move on to Mr. Abuya-Abuya's  Question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. ABDYA-ABUYA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Health the following Question by Private Notice.(a)Is the Minister aware that Kisii District Hospital is. in an appalling state, with many of its buildings having been condemned for human use?(b)Is he further aware that services in this Hospital have deteriorated due to congestion in both out patient and in-patient wards?(c)What happened to plans commissioned by the Ministry three years ago to have the hospital renovated to cater for the prevailing situation?(d)How much money was earmarked for this reha¬bilitation programme and what happened to it?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. arap CHEBOIWO): Mr. Speaker Sir, I beg to reply. (a)I am aware that Kisii District Hospital is an old hospital. It is, however, not correct to say that the buildings have been condemned for human use.(b)It is common for hospitals situated in highly populated areas to experience congestion, but this does not necessarily mean deterioration of services. In fact, Kisii District Hospital is not worse than many other hospitals in the Republic. We have others which are worse than Kisii District Hospital with regard to congestion.(c)I am not aware of any plans commissioned by my Ministry to have the hospitals renovated three years ago.  A sum of kshs.l74,750/- has been earmarked for the 1938/89 Financial Year for the improvement of certain sections of the hospital.(d)I am not aware of the money previusly set aside for the hospital.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ABOYA-ABUYA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am surprised that the Assistant Minister has given a totally misleading picture of the situation in Kisii District Hospital.As regards part (a) of the Question, I would challenge the Assistant Minister to deny that for the last five years the three buildings near the main entrance to the hospital have not been in use. They are therefore, condemned for human use and so he is not right.Two wrongs do not make a right. The Assistant Minister has said that Kisii District Hospital is not the worst hospital. Even if that is so then that is still not an answer because two wrongs do not make a right. The Assistant Minister has not said what he is doing to correct the situation in Kisii District Hospital despite the fact that there are others in the country which are in a similar situation.Hon. Nyakiamo and other Members of Parliament will bail me out of that late last year when hon. Nyakiamo toured Kisii District, he announced that a sum of shs.18 million had been sanctioned for the development of some hospitals by the Governmentunder an agreement signed between the World Bank and the Kenya Government. He said that Kisii District Hospital was going to "benefit from this agreement which covered ten hospitals in the whole of the Republic. The Assistant Minister is, therefore, not right in saying</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order! You are taking too long to ask your supplementary question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ABUYA-ABUYA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, could I ask the Assistant Minister to go back and check the correct answer? I can even quote the name of the contractors who had been given the job of drawing the plans? The answer he has given is totally wrong.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. arap CHEBOIWO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member can E2 challenge me or the Ministry by saying that the answer is wrong. That is according to his opinion. I have no quarrel with him. If what he says is correct, it will be done. What I know is that a total of kshs.27,000/- was allocated during the 1986/87 Financial Year for the renovation of the theatre for operations related to family planning. The Work was completed and the theatre is operational now. To improve out-patients wing, what I know is that</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. ABUYA-ABUYA: On a point of order Mr. Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order! Mr. Abuya-Abuya, why can you not wait for him to finish what he is saying?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ABUYA-ABUYA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister is still misleading the House. I am not asking about the allocations for maintenance given every year. This is a special programme or agreement between the World Bank and the Kenya Government. The Assistant Minister is talking about the annual allocation for maintenance but I am a talking about the special agreement signed between the World Bank, and the Government.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. arap CHEBOIWO: Sir, if the hon. Member could be patient, I was coming to that because I do not have any quarrel with him. What I was saying is that a total of K£27,000/- was allocated in the year 1986/87. Therefore, the renovation of the theatre for the family planning operations has been done. The work was completed and the theatre is operational. In order to improve out-patient services, MCH/FP and surgical contraceptive unit is going to be added to the hospital at a cost of K£174,750. The work will be carried out during the 1987/88 and 1988/89 Financial years. A sum of K£ 20,000/- has been allocated to the hospital during this Financial Year for constructing a perimetre fence to improve security in the hospital. As regards to what the hon. Member has said about the contract between the World Bank and the Government, I am not aware of that. He is talking of an announcement which was made about two years ago by the previous Minister for Health, hon. Nyakiamo. It is good in that he is still here and he is a neighbour of the hon. Questioner, I will check whether this is correct. If the Kisii District Development Committee all hon. Members from Kisii are member? of the committee has recommended that then it must be in the records, I will inform the House a tomorrow about my findings. If my statement will turn to be wrong, I will apologise. If my statement will turn to be correct, then the hon. Member will have to apologise, I will check that information today and tomorrow I will tell the House about my findings if it will be meeting,</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order! Let us go on to the next order.</Newspeech><Header>POINTS OF ORDER</Header><Newspeech>MR. LOTITIYO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. When I asked a Question by Private Notice about the Samburu Consumers Co-operative Society, the Assistant Minister who answered the Question promised to produce the minutes for the liquidation of the said society. I am still waiting for those minutes. Meanwhile, if he cannot get the minutes, could he implement what part (b) of the Question referred to.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CO-OPERATIVE DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Ejore): Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is true that I promised the hon. Member that I would bring the minutes on the liquidation of Samburu Co-operative Society. However, the auction was organised by the District Commissioner, Samburu and that the minutes are being held at the District Commissioners office and not in our Ministry. Our investigations have shown that our officers were not involved and that the auction was done by the then District Commissioner, Sambaru and elders. The minutes are not available, but I am still pressing to see whether I can get them.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OMINDO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I rise on a point of order to seek the leave of the House to allow me to raise a matter of national importance under Standing Order No. 20 on the frequent incursions into our country by the Ugandan troops and also on the interference in our internal affairs by the Libyan Government, It is a matter of national importance and everybody in the country is concerned.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order! The Standing Order the hon. Member is referring to reads as follows and I quote:-"If any Member rising in his place at any time shall propose to move the adjournment of the House for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent national importance, and if (a)Mr. Speaker, rules that the matter is a definite matter of urgent national importance; and(b)not less than 15 other Members rise in their places in support, Mr. Speaker shall nominate a time on the same day at which such a Motion may be moved".Therefore, I agree that it is an important matter indeed and thus you can raise it at the rise of the House, 6.30 p.m. this evening,</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Do we have the required 15 hon. Members rising in their places in support?</Newspeech> (Several hon. Members stood in their places)<Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: All right, you can take your seats. The Motion has the support of the required number of hon. Members,</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUNYAO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I raised a point of order in the morning which I wanted to be replied to by one of the Ministers of State, Office of the President who was in by then. Can he reply to it?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: We have already finished with matters like that. The method you are using shows that we are going backwards.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MATHENGE: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I would like the Minister for Local Government to issue a statement regarding the allocation of plots in Laikipia District. It was only yesterday when about 200 people in one village were allocated plots which were not available. This is particularly happening in Muthara and all other small areas left for public utility. This has become a confusing issue in my constituency. Therefore, I would like the Minister concerned to issue a statement to show how a very small place which is not even suitable for a town can be sub-divided among all the people living there?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order! Mr. Mathenge, actually that is covered under the Local Government (Abridgement of Terms of Office) Bill, The debate on that Bill will be open to all hon. Members to raise such matters. Really there is no need for anybody to give you an answer on that since already there is a Bill on the Order Paper regarding the local authorities.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUNYAO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise on a point of order to pursue another matter which I had raised in the morning. I wanted the Minister of State, Office of the President to make a statement. I was rising on a point of order so that the Minister may respond to that.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: No. Next Order.</Newspeech><Header>PROCEDURAL MOTION</Header><Newspeech>THE VTCE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. Kibaki): Mr.Speaker, Sir, I beg to move:-THAT, this House orders that the publicationperiod of the Nairobi City Commission (Extension of Tenure) Bill (Bill No. 23) be reduced from 14 to 3 days.Mr. Speaker, Sir, those of us who were here yesterday will rememberthat we did go through this discussion on why the matter is urgent and why we  have as it were to clear all the debts so that whatever will happen in 1988 will happen.It is in that process that this particular Motion has been brought because the Bill dealing wi1h the Nairobi City Commission specifically had to be published a little bit later than the others. The reason for this is the same as was explained yesterday.</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: What were the reasons?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE VICE-PHESIDENT AND MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. Kibaki): Mr. Speaker I hope the hon. Members are not asking mo to repeat myself because this is against   our Standing Orders here. However, the particular reasons</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: ON a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is the hon. Member in order to mislead the House that he is not supposed to repeat the same matter when he knows that this is a different Bill altogether. The Bill we now want to deal with is not the same Bill that we discussed yesterday. Therefore, is he in order to mislead the House?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE VICE-P5ESID5ET AND MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. Kibaki): Mr.Speaker, Sir, we are not talking about any Bill here. An hon. Member interjected   asking what were those reasons which were given yesterday and it was in response to that interjection that I said what I did say. I am not making such an obvious mistake and no one should possibly make it by saying that this Bill is the same as the one of yesterday. I was responding to a	n interjection from an hon. Member from this other end of the House.			With those few remarks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. RUBIA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I think we should get that point cleared. The reasons that were given yesterday referred to an entirely different natter and I think, quite seriously, that the Vice-President and Minister far Home Affairs who is also the leader of Government business, should show a little bit of seriousness in this matter. He should know that he is talking of a Commission, which takes care of 1.75 million people in Nairobi. Therefore can he give us reasons why we should reduce the publication days of this Bill from 14 to 3 days?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE VICE - PRESIDENT AND MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. Kibaki): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I seriously object to the idea that I am not taking this matter seriously. No one could be more serious than I am on this Batter, and I do rat know what I am expected to do to show that I am serious on this matter. I am not sure whether one is supposed to show a particular face or even look at anybody in a particular stand, or even shout to show that one is serious. This is a serious matter and ought really to be given due seriousness. This is a legislative matter and it is a fact that Nairobi, as the hon. Member says, has been under a Commission and we are intending to extend the tenure of the Commission and this is in the Bill, itself, hence my avoidance to debate the substance of the Bill. You will agree with me, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that for a Bill so precise that it has only one clause dealing with, the extension of tenure, if one began to give reasons why we intend to extend the tenure of the Commission, then this would be unprocedural. As to whether to debate the Bill or not, it would amount to my moving the Second Reading of the little Bill. So, those of us who have been in this House since 1963 and have gained	 substantial experience know the distinction and that is why I said that I was not going to be tempted to move to the Second Reading of the actual Bill.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Motion before the House now is purely procedural on whether we should go ahead and s discuss the Bill or not and I proposed why we should go ahead.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTORHEY-GENERAL(Mr. Muli): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I stand to second this Motion and I endorse the distinction that is envisaged here. The Motion is calling for the reduction of publication period from 14 to 3 days. If we had the time no doubt we would not call for the reduction of time because obviously the time would naturally run until the 14 days are over.Mr. Speaker, Sir, you did agree the day before yesterday, to recall this Parliament so that we can dispense with certain Government business which Government requested us to carry out. This is why we do not wish to keep the House for a longer period than necessary. When we come to the substance of the Bill, we shall tell hon. Members, particularly, hon. Charles Rubia, why we want to extend the tenure of the Commission. However, there is need, to reduce the days because  the House will not sit for a longer period than is necessary with those reasons. I think the Motion is very well grounded and I therefore, second the motion.</Newspeech>	(There, was noise in the House)<Newspeech>MR. SPEAKERS Order! Order!</Newspeech>(Question proposed)<Newspeech>MR. MUNTAO: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to vehemently object to proposal of reducing the publication period of this Bill from 14 to 3 days. Sir, I will be very brief in my contribution.  First of all, Bill No.22 which was introduced yesterday was dated 11th December but the other Bill which we are now trying to introduce, on the Nairobi Commission(Extension of tenure) Bill No.23, is dated 14th November. In accordance with our Standing Orders No.98, we have only three types of Bills which can be exempted from the publication period of 14 days, that is if a Bill has anything to do with the consolidated fund, Supplimentary Appropriation Bill, or Appropriation Bill. In anycase the publication period of any of these Bills is reduced to seven days and not anything less than seven days. However, here we are being asked to reduce it to 3 days</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order! Do not mislead the House Mr. Munyao because you know  that the days are getting less and less as we along, and so, if the period was 4 days yesterday, it is 3 days today.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUNXAO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I agree with your ruling because I would not like to mislead anybody in this House. However, I feel it will be totally   wrong to reduce the publication period of this Bill because even our Standing Orders require that such a Bill should first appear in the Kenya Gazette and I am doubtful whether this was done with regard to this particular Bill. I will ask the Clerk to the National Assembly to get me the Kenya Gazette of last week to check whether this Bill appears there.	I am saying this because I doubt it ever appears there. I therefore object to reducing the publication period from 14 to 3 days.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR EKERGT AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (MR. Biwott): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think hon. Members ought to really be realistic in this particular case. We are only seeking the permission of the House in order to go deep into the substance of the Bill and that is the time when hon. Members can go deep into the Bill. However, to refuse to grant this House the permission to discuss this Bill, is in fact, being very unrealistic. Saying that the period of 3 days is short, is not enough reason to block the Motion regarding this Bill, in this House. Therefore, I would like to appeal to the hon. Members to be pragmatic because this is one of the Bills which necessitated our being recalled here to debate. I think hon. Members are full of suspicion and there seems to be something which is worrying them or influencing them which, is not the real substance of the Bill.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to conclude by appealing to hon. Members to agree ex to this Procedural Motion so that we can go into the deep details of the Bill where Members will be free to contribute effectively and constructively for the good of the people of Nairobi.With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OMIDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to support this</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OMIDO: Mr. Speaker, sir, I rise to support this Motion because just as the previous speaker has stated, we are not dealing with the meat of the Bill. It is just a Procedural Motion so that we can quickly start discussing the Bill and determine what is going to be the future of theCity Commission of Nairobi. I do not think this is the right timeto oppose because in many occasions, the House has beenrequested to shorten the publication period of Bills and ithas always given leave. So, I believe in the same spiritthat has happened in the past, and in the same spirit we shoulddemonstrate that we have one Government, Therefore, weshould show that the Back—Benchers and the Front—Benchersare working towards the same cause and aspiration. Therefore, I believe that it is proper for the House to agree to reduce the publication period of this Bill.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. Kitele):On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

Biwott has said we will get a chance to debate the substance of this matter. This is purely procedural and, with that, I be to move.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. RUBIA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.I am not challenging the Chair, and I would be the last person to do so but Sir, do you not think it is a bit too much? Front—Benchers are very many I do not see why they  should shorten debates like this.(applause)What kind of democracy are they practising. Is it just	the question of numbers? I felt that I should put this matter to theChair because that is what happened yesterday, and it will happenwhen we start passing the bills. In my view, this amountsto overstretching ones powers.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order! I will now put the Question.</Newspeech> (Question put and agreed to)<Newspeech>THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. Kibaki On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I am just seeking your guidance. The hon. Member for Starehe raised, a point of order, where he asked you whether you could do something about the size of the Front—Bench. Is the hon. Member in order to ask the Speaker of this August House to do things which he cannot do or even attempt to do and which he is not even authorized? This only makes the situation look ridiculous by asking theSpeaker to do things that he cannot do.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. RUBIA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.I would like to respond to that in saying that the Leaderof Government Business knows very well that the Chair, in theinterest of democracy and freedom can allow or disallow theclosure of a debate. If the hon. Vice President and the Leaderof Government Business thinks that I was asking the Speaker.to intervene because of the size, of the Front Bench, that was not my view. I was only appealing to the Chair to use that lee way to allow more freedom of expression which seems to be suppressed by the mere size of the Front—Bench. That is all I was saying.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Biwott): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I think the Leader of Government Business told us the truth, that Front Benchers the Ministers and the Assistant Ministers are there by virtue of other authorities which do not exist in this House. My main point of order is in connexion with the point of order which was raised by the hon. Member for Starehe. Why should he tell us that it is the Front-Bench that carry the day, while the truth of the matter is that the Front—Bench was heavily supported by the Back—Benchers and we had only two or three “does?” Therefore, is the hon. Member in order to continue misleading the House further, while he is still confessing to being a champion of democracy, and democracy is fully working in this House?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: On appoint of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order! I think, Mr. Shikuku, you had better behave like a grown up. I do not see why we should bring in a lot arguments on a thing which  is  really obvious on the point which hon. Rubia raised. The only problem was that you interrupted at an unusual stage. Normally, hon. Members do not stand up and interrupted at such circumstance. With that, I thinkwe better now proceed on like ladies and gentlemen.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We are now on Order No.5 which is followed by the first Reading of the City Commission's Bill and in Order No.7, I think the Clerk of the National Assembly or the typist forgot that the Local Government	 Abridgement of</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>AN.

Sir, I think that Standing Order No.80 prompted hon. Rubia to make the suggestions that he raised. I want it to be put on record that hon. Rubia was not challenging the fact that the Front-Benchi_has a higher number of people, but he was saying that according to Standing Order No.80, the Speaker has discretion to allow debate irrespective of whether the 'Ayes' have it. The Speaker has the discretion to allow debate in the spirit of the Constitution and democracy. Therefore, it should not be understood that hon. Rubia was challenging the number of the Front-Bench.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order! The Standing Order is there, and I do not see any difficulty. I do not see why we should start arguing about a Standing Order which is not really necessary in what we are doing.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: It is!</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

Members will recall that in 1984, I introduced a Bill in this House seeking to amend the Local Government Act, Cap. 265, in connexion with the terms of office of councils from four years to five years. This request was granted by the House. As a result, Section 40 (1), (2) and (3) was accordinglyamended to give the life of terms of office. Therefore, may I move that weread the Bill on Abridgement the Second Reading. I beg to move.</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: No! No! Oooooh No!</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. Mudavadi): Mr. Speaker, Sir, the principal object of this Bill.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. With all due respectto the hon. Member on the Floor of this House, I thought I heard him say "I beg to move", after which he proceeded to resume his seat. After that, something happened and he has now come back to the Floor. Where do we stand? He is supposed to know how to move the Second Reading of a Bill. I heard him say "I beg to move" and then proceeded to resume his Beat and he has now come back again- to explain.</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: He is moving.  He is moving!<Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order! Order, hon. Members. The Minister had just goneback to collect his reference papers and he has now come to continue.</Newspeech>	(Applause)	<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT- (Mr. Mudavadi): As I was saying, Sir, the principal object of this Bill is to shorten the terms of office for all mayors, chairmen, deputy mayors, vice-chairmen and councillors so that they end on a date to be appointed by the Minister for Local Government. Those terms of office would have, otherwise, run in accordance with the 2 provisions of the Local Govern¬ment Act to the end of 1988. The due date to be appointed will enable the local government elections to coincide with the Presidential and National Assembly Election;I beg to move.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Oloo-Aringo): Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me a chance to second this Bill. . Because the Bill is very straightforward, I will highlight one or two issues in it.First of all, I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to His Excellency the President for his wise and pragmatic leadership of our country.This Bill must be seen within, the context. First and foremost, we want to placeit in context. I do this very sincerely because it is the leadership which has been the most important input in the management of state affairs. In fact, it is this leadership which accounts for the success of Kenya, a story that is very well known to all of us.Sir, allow me, first and foremost, to start by thanking His Excellency the President for providing national unity in this country, for providing peace and stability as well as for laying the foundation for socio-economic progress in our country. No matter which direction we look,  whether in education, health, transport or communication, we have made  strides. It is important to register this fact as hon. Members of Parliament, so that we can count our blessings as Kenyans. One of our greatest blessings is the leadership of His Excellency the President.Secondly, Sir, there is another dimension which is important to register. That is that it is the President, more than anybody else in this country,that has taught us to uphold the Constitution. It is the President who firmly supports constitutional government in this country. Besides, it is the p President who has provided us with leadership in support of the rule of law. We have come here because this Government respects the Constitution of this country. We have come here because I this Government respect the rule of law. In fact, Sir, you have recalled Parliament in accordance with the Standing Orders of this Parliament, and also in conformity with the laws of this country. You have recalled this Parliament to give authority for the legal action or actions of both Parliament and the Government. Therefore, as Kenyans, we must support by recognizing that we have always upheld the Constitution and the rule of law. The recall of this Parliament is an excellent example of our commitment to the rule of law. Our critics should acknowledge this, Mr. Speaker, Sir.This is important because this Bill is intended - as the Minister himself has pointed out  to give the Minister  power, as provided for in the Act of Parliament, to dissolve local authorities in the event of the dissolution of Parliament. That is all it is about. I do not see any panic in this. What we are saying is that we acting in accordance with the relevant laws. We are also saying that in event of the dissolution of Parliament, the Minister will act Constitutionally and legally. What is so contradicting about that?Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am so surprised that some of my colleagues want to confuse the country and project as if we are acting unconstitutionally or illegally. We are acting Constitutionally and legally. Secondly, Sir,</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.MWACHOFI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Much as I do not want to interrupt the hon. Member who is contributing very well , my concern is with regard to what he says that some of .his hon. friends would appear or are implying that we are acting unconstitutionally and yet noboby has spoken on this Bill as yet. How does he know? Can he tell us who these people are?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Oloo-Aringo): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was here during the Procedural Motion yesterday and I listened to some of those extravagant remarks and they are the ones I am now referring to. I am intelligentenough to read between the lines. Sir,</Newspeech>(Applause)<Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. This is a very serious matter and I am entitled under Standing Order Ro. 68 to stand at any time on a point of order and I would like the Front-Bench to listen. Could the hon. Minister - he said categorically that he is intelligent enoughto read between the lines - be specific and tell us who thought  or said yesterday that we were acting unconstitutionally?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Oloo-Aringo): Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member for Butere is supposedly an expert on matter of Standing Orders. In this particular instance, I do not see how he can pin me down because I did not refer to him or to anybody else by name. My hon. friend will have time to contribute to this Bill and he will challenge me on every issue that I have raised here.I am not timid; that should be quite clear. I am an hon. Member of Parliament who is popularly elected by the people of Alego. There is no particular speciality in which the hon. Member for Butere is going to try to intimidate me. There are various claims that the hon. Member for Butere was supposedly at Lancaster House but he was, in fact, in the back room somewhere.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. It is a very serious matter for the Minister to use the word "supposedly" when I was in Lancaster House and the Minutes can prove that. If he is not going to sub¬stantiate that, I would like him to withdraw that remark because I was in Lancaster House. He should not use the word "supposedly" because I was there.</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: So what?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: I am on a point of order, Sir. I was not  as he said, in the back room. Can he substantiate that hon. Shikuku was in Lancaster House in the back room?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Oloo-Aringo): Mr. Speaker, Sir. the hon. Member for Butere and I agree that he was in Lancaster House but it is a huge building.	</Newspeech>(Laughter)<Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker,  Sir. When people talk of Lancaster House, they are talking about the Independence of this country which took place in the Lancaster House Conference. I am talking of having.- not supposedly  attended the Lancaster House Constitutional Conference in London in 1963. Can the hon. Minister now substantiate that I never attended that Conference and that I was in the back room? He should say so.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr.Oloo-Aringo): Mr. Speaker, Sir, withall due respect to lay hon. colleague; the hon. Member for Butere. I didmention, of course, that Lancaster House has a conference hall and otherrooms in which other functions take place. Secondly, Sir, the evidence in the Press in the last publication on Jamhuri Day, did not include his name amongst those who attended the Lancaster House Conference. That is adequate evidence.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Am I to believe that we can have this sort of misleading and rather vexing attitudes? The truth of the matter is that I was in Lancaster House.	</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: So What?</Newspeech><Newspeech>ME. SHIKUKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am on a point of order. The hon. Minister said that my name did not appear amongst those who were in Lancaster House Conference. The facts are that I was the Secretary-General of the Kenya African Democratic Union. I was together  with hon. Muliro - who is an hon. Member  of this House, hon. Seroney, who was a Kadu delegate and hon. ole Tipis. Is it true that</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order! I think this is becoming rowdy. There is nothing really in the fact that hon. Shikuku was in the Lancaster House Conference; many other people were there too.</Newspeech>	(Applause)<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Oloo-Aringo): Mr. Speaker, Sir,I thank you for your very wise ruling</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENERGY AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Adichareh): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I think we should not be proud of what we have done. Hon. Shikuku is saying that he was in Lancaster House; I was there also. It was not in 1963 as he says butfrom November 1961 to April 1962. We were there and we are not proud of it. Everybody was there including hon. Nyagah. Why should we be proud of what we have done; it should be upon the people to praise us.</Newspeech>(Applause)<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Oloo-Aringo): Mr. Speaker, Sir,I once again thank you most sincerely.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ANGATIA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I would like to seek your guidance on this issue. Being in Lancaster House is a fact of history and it is either that somebody was there or not.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>AS HON .MEMBER: So what?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ANGATIA: I am still on a point of order, Sir. It is not a question of who argues loudest or most accurately in this House today. It is a fact of history. If hon. Oloo-Aringo knows that hon. Shikuku was not in Lancaster House, you have the right, Sir, to give us the correct facts as to whether he was there or not. If he was there, then hon. Olco-Aringo should withdraw those re narks. If hon. Shikuku was there, there is no reason why we should be told that he was not there when it is a fact of history.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: You can continue, Mr. Oloo-Aringo.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Oloo-Aringo): Thank you, Mr.Speaker, Sir. I can handle the situation.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BOMETT: On a point of order,Mr. Speaker, Sir. I do not think that the matters which are .now being raised all the time are really points of order. We have a matter here which is urgent and we are now being taken back on matters of Lancaster House. It was stated that the hon. Member was in Lancaster House. Why should we continue to talk about Lancaster House? Can you protect this House, Sir?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Oloo-Aringo): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.Sir.</Newspeech> '  <Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: OrderI I think we better stop all these. There is too much shouting and so on and I think we had better change the way we are doing things and embark on the job which we have here.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Oloo-Aringo) : Thank you very much, once again for your wise guidance. As I said, even in this honourable House, there are members of the public who are attending the proceedings within the Galleries. Likewise, there are those who attended the Lancaster House proceedings within the galleries./Having said that, let me turn to the main issue and the theme of my discussion. The theme of my discussion is that we respect the Constitution and the rule of law. That is why we have come to this. House, to seek the authority of this House, to act legally and constitutionally, in the event of the dissolution of Parliament. Yesterday, in the course of the deliberations, we were misled by being asked what the hurry is about, that this Parliament has a five-year life. This is true. The Constitution provides for the life of Parliament to be five years, but  the Constitution also provides His Excellency the President, as Head of State and Head of the Government, with the prerogative to dissolve Parliament and call elections in the interest of the State. He is the one person who has the mandate of this country, as a whole, for that Constitutional prerogative. We should not, therefore, as a Parliament, be seen, as these few critics are trying to put it, to be here to tie the hands of the President. We must not be seen here to be attempting to usurp the power which, by Constitution, we have arrogated to the President. Therefore,</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>MR. ANGATIA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I do not know why the atmosphere is being unduly heated up. If there is anybody who is trying to anticipate when the President will call elections, it is the people who are hurrying these things, as if elections are going to be held tomorrow. As far as everybody knows, we have not finished five years, and itis completely the prerogative of the President to call elections.No-one should anticipate that; no one should try to tie thehands of the p President,  that elections will come in thenext two weeks. We should be debating s as if there is noanticipation for elections; as if there is no expectation ofelections, until the President ,himself, calls elections. The Minister is out of order; he is misleading us.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: That was not really a point of order; you are arguing against him but not raising a point of order.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Oloo-Aringo) : Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir. I thought that after these healthy four and a half years or so, my colleague would have understood what a point of order is as appeared to sheer argument. That was a point of argument. I will play it as it is.Mr. Speaker, let me point out, therefore, that while  there was this argument, which was put forward yesterday by my colleague, the hon. Member for Starehe, in fact, he ignored the other part of the Constitution which vests the power of dissolving Parliament in the hands of the President. Therefore, this House has every right to give His Excellency the President the freeway. That is what I mean. We must not, as hon. Members of Parliament, argue as though that Constitutional prerogative does not exist; it does exist.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. RUBIA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Cabinet Minister has become very controversial. The hon.Minister is misquoting me and a little bit of civility will help him. What I said yesterday was in answer to hon. Mutisos words. I was not raising that purely as my contribution to the debate, I rose on a point of order. I would like your protection, Mr. Speaker. The hon. Minister is becoming a bit provocative.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Oloo-Aringo): I have a lot of respect for my hon. colleague from Starehe, but I also know that if he can only listen to what I want to say, he will get the point of my argument.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would, therefore, like to take thisopportunity to appeal to my hon. colleagues to pass this Bill as it is and to allow us, as a country, to continue to act Constitution¬ally and legally. Having said that, I think it is very fitting,  on an ocassion like this one, to pay tribute to the role which has been played by some local authorities in assisting in the management of affairs. There are some local authorities which have discharged their duties very honourably, and, I think, they deserve a pat on the back. Some members of various councils have joined hands with the hon. Members of this House and have continued to contribute very effectively to the development process of this country. They have contributed at the level of sub-locational development committees, locational development committees and also as members of the district development committees. They have also contributed as members of district education boards as well as land boards. Therefore, it is fitting, first of all, to give due credit to the role that has been played by several local authorities.It is also true that the work of some cotmcils has been paralysed because, councillors, instead of seeing their role in the development process, see councils as stepping stones to Parliament. Therefore, we hope that councillors will take heed and understand that they have a responsibility to contribute to the development process of this country, even at the council level, and not to see coun¬cils as spring-boards to Parliament., If we did this, the councils would have more initiative, they would run more effectively, and they would  assist in the total contribution of the developmentof our country in all its various aspects. I am saying thisbecause they have the platform. In fact, if there is any traditionwhich we have preserved in this country, it is the democratictradition  that we participate and discuss our issues freely,and that people are free, at all levels, to contribute tothe development of this country.Having said that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me also addthat we in the Party members of the Party, which all of usare have an important role to play. I say this becausewe are continuously and His Excellency the President set avery good example here searching on how to make oursystem function effectively and democratically. The searchcontinues. There is no end to it because we are an evolvingsociety and we shall continue to learn from our total experiences,as a people. Therefore, I think we have a role, as a Party,to guide the various institutions. I do not think there is anydoubt in Kenya any more that it is the Party that is supremein this State because this Parliament emanates from the Party.The Government emanates from the Party. All the other institutionsare subordinate to the decisions of the Party. For that reason,I think the Party's role, in assisting the mobilization ofour people, in giving advice to the various members of our variousinstitution this House and the local authorities includedshould be strengthened even more. In fact, the Party has nowreached the grassroot level. The Party is present at the sub-locational and locational level. It is very important that even though all candidates who run for elections aremembers of this Party, it is very important for the leaders ofthe Party to expose  those divisive elements; and they are many.Only the other day, we had “Mwakenya” members in this House.Those elements that want to infiltrate the Part y to subvert it from within, should "be exposed.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.WAMALWA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I have a lot of respect for the Minister contributing, but if this Bill will .</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order, Mr. Wamalwa. I think I should put the Question first.</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: But he is on a point of order.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. WAMALWA: I was on a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to state that as much as I respect the Minister, and given the urgency of this Bill, I wonder whether this debate on party matters is really terribly relevant here.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Oloo-Aringo): Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a Bill, and all the elements that touch on it are important and relevant. I think it is important that you-allow me to put the discussion of the Bill in context. I have placed that context.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. MWACHOFI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. In his last sentence before he was interrupted, the Minister mentioned something which could be misunderstood. He said that the party leadership should have the power to expose those who are not in line with the party. He said that such people are there, and that it was only recently that we had "Mwakenyas" in this House. I hope that he meant to say that we heard "Mwakenya" being mentioned in the House.  However, he said that we had "Mwakenyas" in this House9 He should make a correction here very clearly.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Oloo-Aringo): Mr." Speaker, Sir, I was. referring to the former Member of Parliament, hon.Ngumba, who himself declared that he was prepared to lead "Mwakenya".	Having said that, let me add that it is my duty as Member of this House to ensure  that as a people, "we evolve this democractic system without fear, and that we support the constitutional and legal action which we are taking to safeguard this country and democrac.,Mr. Speaker, Sir, with those few remarks, I beg to second.</Newspeech> (Question proposed)<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT ARD NATURAL RESOURCES (Mr. Nyagah): Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me an opportunity to speak. I willstart off with an appeal to my colleagues here to look at the memorandum ofobjects and reasons of this Bill. The object of this Bill is very simple.We know that in 1988, which is just next door, on a date to be appointed by the President, the House will be prorogued and there will be elections. That is a fact. The Bill says that in order to save our people from being harassed by two sets of elections the Presidential and National Assembly elections, and Civic elections at another odd time of the year - the two sets should be brought	Together. We know that, in order to do that, the President, in his wisdom, willappoint a date for that purposes, according to the Constitution. The Minister inthis case is asking that he, too, be given powers to be able to say, "Since thePresidential and National Assembly elections have been declared, I, too, dodissolve local councils." These councils will include mayors, deputymayors, chairmen and other elected officers of local authorities. That is what we have to address ourselves to.We went on a very well-earned recess but, because the Kenya Constitution is paramount, we had to come back to give a constitutional right to the Minister to do what is being asked for in the Bill. I believe that that is all we are in for. If we could, disregarding anything else that we feel, confine ourselves to that very essential part, of the Bill, we would do this work with the utmost speed that it deserves.With these few remarks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. BOMETT: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not want to say much because this Bill is, in fact, straightforward. However, from the trend of affairs, during the last two weeks before we went on recess and during the period that we have been back here for the purpose of this Bill, we should not  see the unfortunate and an uncalled for situation whereby, although we are one partyand are all Members of Parliament.- I have never seen any division here there has been a tendency of bringing up an "ugly head". I appeal to hon. Members, as the hon.Member for Nakuru North/ and as a member of Kanu, to remember that we are one and we belong to one country.There is only one thing that we are requested to do here. I do not see why we should really fear. If these elections come tomorrow, as members of Kanu, we should respond when we are called at any time. I know that somebody is afraid of something, but I do not know why this should be so. I hope thatwe are all ready to move on. We have worked for four years now, and we knowthat the prerogative of dissolving this Parliament rests with the President. If the President dissolves Parliament in August, 1988, or at any other time, it will "be all right because he has that power. All that is being required here is that we synchronise the Presidential and National Assembly elections with Civic elections. I think this request is straightforward. I appeal tohon. Members to ensure that we give the Minister for Local Government to supportare being requested to give him.I do not think that there is any point in our talking as if we are different. In fact, we are all elected by Kanu, and we have all sworn our allegiance to Kanu. So, I appeal that we all get together and pass this Bill this afternoon without any further delay.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MRS. ASIYO: Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to support this Bill. I will be very brief.The Bill  speaks for itself. Even if this House was not going to be dissolved, we would not come back in time next year to discuss the City Commission and give it another life because its life would have expired on 31st March, 1988. Surely, the whole point is very clear.</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: It is not the City Commission, but other local authorities. It is local authorities.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MRS. ASIYO: Yes, I am talking about the abridgement, of term of officeof local authorities.I do not think there should be any problem in the passing of this Bill because in his introduction, the Minister made it very clear to the House why there should be this abridgement of terms of office. I want to go along with the sentiments that have been expressed and whole-heartedly support the passing of this Bill this afternoon.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR-ENERGY AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Biwott) : Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I would like to express similar sentiments to those that have already been expressed regarding this Local Government (Abridgement of Terms of Office) Bill. This matter is clear. It is a consequential and a contigency matter. This is a Bill that has to be passed in order to synchronise our elections timing so that the Presidential and National Assembly elections and civic elections coincide. Whether these elections will take place in 1988 or not, all we know is that they will take place. This is a fact. Whether we are made to pass this Bill now as opposed to doing it in the beginning of next year, is immaterial. Suppose, for instance, that we are recalled here on 2nd January, 1988 - no elections will take place before 2nd January, 1988 because Christmas comes in the middle of next week - we will have been recalled to deliberate on some formal Business. As members of Kanu, to which we have  all sworn allegiance, we stand ready to be called to serve the nation at any time. We will have been recalled to serve the nation by tidying up some Ioose ends that require tightening.	Because  the memorandum of objects and reasons of this Bill is so	clearly stated and because we know that this has to happen as the Bill istriggered for the Presidential and National Assembly elections and the Ministerfor Local Government has to call his own civic elections, too, in order to getthings moving, my only appeal to hon. Members is that we do not read too manyextrenuous things into an otherwise straightforward and clear proceduralmatter which must be legalized.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me an opportunity too to support this Bill. This is a clear demonstration of Democracy because, if the Government was to ignore these facts and then perhaps, the Minister for Local Government acts against the Constitution and against the Law, we would be blamed for not doing our jobs.(applause)We will not then be Upholding the Constitution. Hon. Memberswill agree with  me that they leave fears about the elections - notfears of being defeated but fears of the elections commingsooner than they expected. I am sure that everybody wouldsupport that if the elections were to come sooner than they wereexpected, it would be better because the registration of voters andis over, and we would not like stay campaigning for more than a year. So, if that is the fear, it should not be there.I would only like to ask the Minister for Local Government not to repeat the mistakes he made in the previous years. If the elections were to come, and councillors were to be elected, there are a lot of vacancies for nomination of councillors. The mistakes I am talking about are the mistakes that were made in certain areas like in Meru District where nominated councillors - even where they are more than the seven constituencies - they were all nominated from one particular constituency. We would like to see a fair distribution of the nomination of councillors so that the Minister will appear to be acting rightly.My last point is that the Attorney-General should think of making the registration of voters a permanent phenomenon so that we do not have to go to register voters when elections are near; so that we do not have to give our people anxiety about elections and election feaver when people start registering.I think the laws of this country must change so that the registration of voters becomes a permanent feature so that it becomes like now that you have an identity card, you have a voters card. Then elections can be called any time without a lot ofWarning. We are taking too much time on registration; checking the register and so on. So, if we were carrying the voters card like we carry our identity cards, then the President would have a very easy time saying elections are going to be next month  without raising any election feavers anywhere and so on. With those few remarks, I support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE (Mr. Muigai):Thank you Mr. Speaker,:Sir, for giving me this opportunity. All  we Kenyans should be grateful to God because we very often hold elections when they are supposed to be held. This is a phenomena that is not found in a lot of countries on our continent. I thinkour citizens have done this country proud  to have kept the tradition of democracy ; of holding elections.</Newspeech>(The Minister for Education (Mr. Oloo-Aringo) Stood near the Table taking water)<Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.Do you realize that there are two Members on the Floor; one takingwater and the other one speaking? I thought he would take the glass of water and withdraw, but he stood there taking water while the other Member was still speaking - which is against the Standing Orders.</Newspeech>(laughter)<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE (Mr. Muigai):Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir. The  Bill in front of us only servesto make that system neater and to bring the elections ofthe local authorities closer to those of Parliament. For that</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE (Mr. Muigai) (Ctd.):we have no reason not to support this Bill because it just facilitates what is good in Kenya during elections to be done even better.My point is a little bit different. Members have talked about when the elections would be; or when they will not be, but elections will come in 1988 when His Excellency the President chooses to announce the elections. My point is that we have now a new system of doing elections which involves queing. It is a system that we have, not gone through before. Probably, because there is some nervousness among the Members of Parliament, it is also reflects to a certain extent some nervousness among the citizens, while one cannot say when is the appropriate time to know all the details as to how the elections will be carried out, we would call on the Kanu headquaters to probably come up with the rules, the regulations and the logistics on how this election will be done, and that nervousness may calm down a little bit. People have a habit, or it is human nature to be a bit apprehensive for what you do not know; but once you know it, then you can live with it and settle down. Y/e might also ask that the Kanu headquaters through the media, especially the Voice of Kenya, to come out with these rules and regulations that will be practised. The Voice of Kenya, should publicise those rules so that the electors and those that are aspiring to be elected know what their role is and how they are supposed to behave. There are some things that have not been quite clarified in those procedures and we hope that the Kanu headquaters will do that. In the middle of this, as a central point, is whether the queing system is a clearing system or a nomination system. If it is a clearing system  as we know clearance, such that it takes the place of the clearance that the Party headquaters was doing - then it has certain implications.I do not know whether - if we consider it strictly as a clearing process - the 70 per cent will also hold in a clearing process. Because once you have been cleared and have to go by the laws of nomination, then you still have to go to nominations whether you got your 70 per cent or did not get you 70 per cent. You might even fail once you been cleared with 70 per cent. If it isthe nomination process, then we must think whether we need to change the law so that the law that governs the nomination process is brought into line with what we are doing. It is a brilliant idea to have this system. As one of the Members said I think it was hon. Oloo-Aringo: our political processes must keep in pace with the other developmentof the country and that evolvement is what we are in now. Nobodyshould feel afraid in any way that change should not be welcome.Change can always be welcomed so that our country must continueto evolve politically, economically and socially and that this will keep in pace with each other.With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>Mr. SIFUNA: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to support this Bill. I hope that the entire Housewill support this Sill. But I would like to remind the Minister for local Government one thing. At one time when he was replying to a Question I had asked in this House, in connection with four wards created in M Bungoma Municipal Council. Up to now these wards have not been Gazetted.I therefore hope that the Minister for Local Government will take note of this and make sure that the four wards - Range, Seretanyi, Ndengelwa - are Gazetted so that wananchi will know where to vote during the next general elections.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to urge the Minister for local Government to consider giving more responsibilities to these local authorities. This is because a lot of responsibilities have been taken away from local authorities. You will find that councillors have been left with no work and as a result of this they have resorted to squabbling and so on.So, if they are given more responsibilities they will have no time for gossiping and so on."I would also like to touch on the salaries paid to councillors. We know that the Government reviews civil servants salaries from time to time. Even we Members, in this Parliament and the previous one, have had bur salaries  reviewed twice. But you will find that councillors salaries were reviewed only once. So, the Minister for local Government should review the salaries paid to councillors in our local authorities.Y/ith these few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING(Mr. Kitele): Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me a chance to air my views on this Bill. I will be brief. First of all I would like to thank His Excellency the President for leading this country peacefully. We are breathing the air of freedom and this freedom is guaranteed to us by His Excellency the President.Mr.Speaker, Sir, I think this Bill is very simple and straightforward and it shows very clearly that Kenya is a democratic country. He brought the Bill here so that it can be discussed by this august House. The House should discuss and pass the Bill.Mr.Speaker, Sir, yesterday one hon. Member said here that His Excellency the President takes this House seriously. This is why this Bill has been brought  to us here as representatives of the people. We should discuss it and pass it. Mr.Speaker, Sir, if you look at Clause 3 of the Bill you will find that it reads as follows:"Upon the date appointed under section 2, all councils shall stand dissolved and the Minister shall take immediate steps to reconstitute them in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Local Government Act."Mr.Speaker, Sir, I think this is a very good thing.HisExcellency the President has promised us that we are going to enjoydemocracy in this country. So, hon.Members should feel honouredbecause this Bill has been brought here for them to see and pass it.This Bill is short. We do not know when the general elections willbe held. According to us elections should be held sometime in a August or September next year . But the President has got powersto call elections any time.But we hon. Members of this Housemust feel honoured because we have freedom to discussissues in this House.This is because in other countries they passthings without discussing theme. We have democracy in this country.People say that there is democracy in Europe but there is no democracy in Europe. This is because a party chooses the people it wants to contest seats. So, people in those countries are never given a chance to make their own choice. But here in Kenya, during the next general elections, people will form a queue behind the candidate of their choice.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. GACHANJA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.We are not supposed to interefere with the running of other people's Governments. Is it in order, therefore, for the hon. Member to tell us that there is no democracy in Britain?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr.Kitele): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will hot say that there is something wrong with my hon.friend's ears. I know that he is perfect.But I mentioned Europe. There is no country called Europe. If the hon. Member knows of a country called Europe I challenge him to tell the House where that country is. We have freedom in Kenya. We are here to do whatever we want to do.Mr.Speaker, Sir, since there are many hon.Members who want to speak, I will not take a lot of time on this, and with those few remarks, I support this Bill fully.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR RESEARCH, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (Mr. Ayah): Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I really did not want to say very much. But as I listened to my hon.friends contributing to this Bill one thing came out very clearly to me; the fact that we are all agreed that we in this country are following the rule of law. We in this country are following our Constitution, word for word. Also in this country we are trying to make quite sure that the basis of law is the reason for our peace.Mr.Speaker, Sir, as I sat down listening I also had one idea which came to me; that sometimes we do not go to the next extension of this very fundamental issue. We are attempting to pass this Bill - and I am sure we will do so - based on the fact- that we want , to be Constitutional, legal and peaceful. But we must go to the logical extension. I have tried to say to myself that this must be the reason why some people do not like this country.Some people would like to see a state of unpeacefulness in this country. This isbecause we happen to want to follow the rule of law we want to be peaceful; becausewe want to be constitutional some people feel that this is a country that should be		Undermined and interfered with. Where I come from we have a saying that a hyena mightlive in a sugar-cane farm without knowing how sweet the sugar-cane. Mr. Speaker, Sir, sometimes I get the feeling that we are In living in acountry which is so legal; so constitutional and so peaceful that we tend to take  these things for granted; we do not look beyond that and be proud of thatfact. But we should look at the logical extension and see that the reason why people do not like some is because we are doing exactly what we are doing here.Mr. Speaker, Sir, yesterday, you gave us the guideline by Quoting to us the provisions of our own Standing Orders, which have made us come back here I therefore feel that I can only explain for instance, the reason why Libya, through other countries in the neighbourhood and some of our own people in this country maybe some students You can only explain the machinations of people like the Libyans.you look at the fact that because we are so peaceful, constitutional and follow the law so well, other people would like to undermine our stability. The reason, therefore, why I stood up was to ask my hon. colleagues that sometimes we mustgo to the next extension of our state of affairs. Once we accept that we are following the rule of law; we are being constitutional, we-must also expect that other people will try to undermine our stability.On that basis, Mr. Speaker, Sir, while I support this Bill very strongly,would like to say to people like the Libyans  and whoever else they are using in the neighbourhood  that we have intention of changing our ruling our country of changing bur method of conducting our £ affairs just because we happen to be peaceful, constitutional and legal.Mr. Speaker, Sir I beg to support the Bill.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Kisiero): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. In view of the fact that this is a very simple and clear Bill, I would I be in order to propose that the Mover be now called upon to reply;</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order I will put that Question.</Newspeech>(Question, that the Mover be now called upon to reply, put and, agreed to)<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVORNMENT (Mr. Kudavadi): Mr. Speaker, Sir, first of all I would like to thank all hon. Members of Parliament in this House, who have supported the idea of shortening the terms of office of local authorities. I am very pleased because what this Bill means is very simple. It merely means that since the local authorities, according to their terms of office, will run up to the end of next year, it would be better for me to seek this permission from this hon. House to appoint a date when the local authorities would stand dissolved. The date to be appointed will entirely depend upon the date when His Excellency the President will choose to dissolve this House and call for the Presidential and Parliamentary Elections. For that reason, it would be unfair for the House to hold the hands of the President. He has got to be free because he knows the secret; he knows the date when he will make his own decision to dissolve Parliament. For that reason, I should be well equipped; otherwise, it would mean that local authorities would continue operating until such a time that their terms of office expire towards the end of next year.Mr. Speaker, Sir, our intention has always been that the Presidential and Parliamentary Elections must coincide with the elections of local authorities. I am very pleased that the hon. Members are going to give me this approval. This will enable me to be ready so that when the President dissolves this House and calls for Presidential and Parliamentary Elections, I will then be in a position, depending, on his date, to dissolve all local authorites in. the country, except in Nairobi.Mr. Speaker, Sir, there have been interesting remarks s about how we could improve our institutions. I think hon. Karauri was right; it did happen in when the Administration gave names which appeared to be from one constituency. In normal circumstances, the Administration, in consultation with .the local people, try to give me names of people whom they feel, when nominated to be councillors are likely to serve the interests of wananchi and the Government. This is what they normally expect. But I can assure this House, because there was that weakness, this point will be observed very strictly.Mr. Speaker, Sir, regarding the wards in Bungoma, the district commissioners (D.C.s) and my officer in charge of Local Government elections, together with the office of the Attorney General, have been going round to look at the newly created locations, and see whether they would be regarded as electoral units.that I can do about this is to assure that the Member for Bungoma South, Hon. Sifuna, is that if registration has already taken place in certain areas, known as electoralunits, it will be difficult to change that now If registration has not taken place, it will be up to the hon. Member to consult the D.C. Bungoma, and then advise me on the possibility of creating those new locations or sub-locations as electoral units,Mr. Speaker, Sir, with regard to responsibilities of councillors it is true that councillors, once elected, some of them keep on quarrel ling as to who should become the major Even after electing the mayors or chairmen, they always want to remove them. That is the reason why they remain idle backbiting each other. But as a matter of fact, in a county council like Bungoma, if the councillors are to go round and check on development, there is enough work for them to do. But I agree, with the hon. Members that they tend to group themselves, or divide than selves into groups just to oppose those who hold offices in their councils.Mr. Speaker, Sir, with those few remarks, I beg to move.</Newspeech>(Question put and agreed to)(The Bill was read a Second Time and committed to a Committee of the whole House today by leave of the House)<Header>COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE HOUSE</Header>	(Order for Committee read)Mr. Speaker left the Chair <Header>IN THE COMMITTEE</Header>Mr. Chairman took the Chair<Header>The Statute Law (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill</Header><Newspeech>MR.

SHIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Chairman, Sir. On page581 of the Supplementary Order Paper, you will find that there is anerror. If you look at the amendment proposed, it reads and I quote:"THAT, the Schedule to the Bill be amended in relation to the Workmen’s Compensation Act (Gap.236) —"You will find that in paragraph (a) it says delete the expression, and insert the following: Now, if you look at what is being inserted, it is exactly the same as what is being deleted. . Have you noticed that?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHAIRMAN: Order, Mr. Shikuku  We had already dealt with that yesterday and at the time of reporting progress, we were on the item "The Local Government Act", and that is where I am beginning now, Continue, Attorney General.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY GENERAL (Mr. Muli): Mr. Chairman, Sir, the amend¬ment is yet is another point which goes to show that this House has got its own respect and must be respected. We do not take it for granted. Again, we would like to do things constitutionally and in accordance with the law.</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Chairman, Sir, the amendment sought under sub-Section 3 of Section 252  on the Order Paper you will see the actual Section as it stands now. It gives power to the Minister on discussion of a Local Authority or formation of a Commission. It gives the Ministerpower to extend the life of a Commission like Nairobi, but I do not want this to be thought it is for Nairobi City Commission because we are dealing with Nairobi City Commission as a separate matter. It gives the Minister power to order by a further period not exceed¬ing one year You can see that under little (i). Under little (ii), lie can only do so with a resolution of this House.Now, Mr. Chairman, Sir, if the House has given a resolution and the Minister extends it for a further period, as I read little (ii you cannot come back to the House at all for a further resolution. That one is restrictive and according to the construction of the section, it means that you cannot come back here for a resolution for power provided by the Act. For the House to give a resolution, it is exhausted by little (i). I say that is restrictive. The amendment ".sought is, therefore; to remove that factor, and to enable the House to give by resolution more than once or as many times as can be necessary for an extension of a Commission. That is provided for under little (ii) on the opposite page of the Order Paper. The new reading will be as follows:"thereafter by the Minister, by order "You can see that I have omitted the word by a further" order. That phrase  by a further order is restrictive. It means only one resolution. You cannot do it anymore. But now we are removing that to allow "by order made with authority of a resolution "</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Chairman, Sir. I have beentrying to listen to the Attorney General very attentively, but there is too muchnoise. I cannot follow what he is saying Could he repeat what he has said?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE CHAIRMAN: Could hon. Members please consult gently? There is a lotof murmuring in the House and this Bill is fairly new and hon. Members ought toreally hear .what the Attorney General is saying. Carry on Mr. Muli.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY GENERAL (Mr. Muli): That you very such, Mr. Chairman.As I have said, and for the sake of clarity, to avoid any repetition, I wouldlike to refer hon. Members again to sub-paragraph (ii) of Section 252. (3) andI would like to read it again."Thereafter by the Minister, by a further order made with the authority of a resolution of the National Assembly"Mr. Chairman, Sir, "by a further order" is restricted. It says thatthe National Assembly can only give "by one further". I am reading "One" insteadof "a" In which case once the National Assembly has passed that resolution,it cannot do it again and that is why I am complaining that the hands of theHouse are tied. Therefore, I would like to move this amendment to remove thefetters, so that should there be a necessity for the Minister to issue a furtherextension, then he can come back to the House and the House; will, with unlimitedpowers say yes or no. We are doing this because s we do not want to do .thingsillegally." Therefore, the new Section will now read as follows:"thereafter by the Minister, by order"Therefore, there will be no question of. "by further order", and it will continue as follows"made with authority of a resolution of the National Assembly for an additional period or additional periods".The House would be interested to know the main clause of the amendment is to removethat fetter so that anytime the Minister would like a commission to be extended,he must come back here. However, as the law stands now, what we did in 1985was enough and cannot be done again, and that is my interpretation of the section.I think I am correct in so interpreting it, that is, the Minister's hands are tiedonly once and fees there could be a danger here in that the House cannot be requiredto exercise its powers even twice or three times should there be a need for extensionof a commission for a further period. I plead with hon. Members to understand that except for the exercise in Nairobi, but this one is not affecting the others, and I will explain so later on This one is a general preposition of thee law for amendment for the future. So, Sir, I think that amendment is fully explained. I wanted to explain it in details because it is new and does things that we would like dons legally and also not to tie the hands of this House where it is necessary for it to pass a resolution.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWACHOFI: Mr. Chairman, Sir, I am grateful for the explanation of the Attorney General and I am just wondering whether I would be allowed to comment on what he has just said regarding what he refers to as a "fetter", which he wants to remove My understanding of what the law says is very clear. It talks of a further period". That means that the House can only be asked to make that resolution once and no more, as the Attorney General himself said. Therefore, Sir, the spirit in which this kind of law is made, where a local government has to be under a commission is the spirit of democracy where we want the people to be represented by the people they have elected. That is why I am quite sure, that fetter was there so that Parliament can only resolve once that those people in that particular local authority remain under a commission and that after that, it should not be possible to resolve to hold an election. So, to agree with this amendment means that we are agreeing with the Attorney-General that this Ho us 9 is going to give itself the responsibility of denying the e people in particular local authorities, the freedom to exercise their democratic rights. This is very dangerous and I do not support it.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY GENERAL(Mr. Muli): I would like to respond to that point. The intention of this amendment is not the way the hon. Mwachofi has put it. We cannot extend the tenure of a commission without first coming to this House. The merit of the extension by a resolution will be	determined at the time ofthe resolution and the House will be able to say, "les" in which case the Minister can exercise Ms powers. If the House has given a negative resolution, there is no reason why the Minister cannot exercise his powers by way of an order is which case, there would be no extension of tenure. So, the merit will be determined at the timewhen the resolution is represented. I do not accept the general prepositionthat the House is being given, the power to deny rights. Those words are veryimportant. the House has been given very close responsibility and theintention hare is not to deny anybody rights. As a matter of fact, the Ministeris now being given that extra power so that in the event of there being need.in a particular local authority for an extension of tenure for a commission, will be one, first there by considering that proposal through a resolution. If, in thewisdom of the House, the House decides that there is need to extend the tenure, it should not be fettered  but the house should be able to say so. If there is no need to extendthe tenure, then the House should limit the tenure. So, Mr. Chairman,this is a very useful amendment which does not, in any way, harm the House.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. RUBIA: Mr. Chairman, Sir, I am concerned about this Clause.The hon. Attorney General has endeavoured to explain the amenement, but he hasnot told us what is wrong with the existing provision. He has not told us why we need to change the present law. The change we have in the Act now was quite deliberate because we know that with this kind of a provision, the Minister  and I am not talking about the present Minister because I do not think he is that type may like to control so many local authorities from his desk by appointing commissions. The hon. Attorney General has explained the essence of the amendment and, I think it is very clear. I do not think there is any need for him to try and explain it further. However, he has not told us what this law in the Act is, so ±s that any Minister cannot extend the life of a commission for a period of more than two or three terms as it is at the moment.Mr. Chairman, Sir, I am very worried</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ATTOENEY GENERAL (Mr. Muli) Mr. Chairman, Sir,</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. HUBIAs Mr. Chairman Sir, I have not finished, and I think the Attorney- General should take this calmly because I am pointing these filings to him very calmly myself. I am concerned about the Nairobi City Commission. As a matter of fact, the Attorney General might say that I am suspicious, but I am human being likeanybody else and a human being must suspect right now, I, am very suspicious. We are being asked to pass this amendment</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHAIRMAN  We already have a Bill before the House and I am sorry, .I cannot allow you to go into other things.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. RUBIA I am just trying to explain Mr. Chairman.  Sir we are being asked to pass this amendment under the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Amendment Bill. However, if we pass this particular amendment, it will mean that even if the one referring to the Nairobi City Commission does not go through, the Minister will still have the chance of giving the commission a further term and I am very saga suspicious about this, and that is the fact as I see it. Mr. Chairman, it may be that the Attorney General is moving this amendment with good intentions, but I do not see why we need to amend the existing Act.The Attorney General says that the Minister will come to Parliament every time, since Parliament is the supreme authority, but that is better written and said that actually done. Nobody should underestimate our sense of intelligence because we have seen, even thi3 afternoon, what Parliament can be put through. Things can be put through the throats of Members of Parliament and there is no way you can reverse whatever goes on because the "Ayes" are the majority. We have seen that this afternoon. So, although that is democracy as we understand it, democracy must also be realistic.Mr. Chairman, what I am saying is that the present Clause is sufficient.A Minister who cannot re-organise his local authorities after, say For example,the City Commission of Nairobi has had a life of five years. That should be a period enough. Why do you want to deny the people of this city, a town or a village that basic right of theirs as democratic people? How we claim to be democratic if we go on denying people democracy? I feel that I am bound to oppose this amend¬ment because I know what it can do. We have seen it in Nairobi and, if it goes through, it will apply elsewhere. I know the Government has a lot of voting power and, therefore, they will probably push it through. However, I have a duty and responsibility to state my mind and say, in the interest of this country and democracy, we should not push this amendment through by using the voting power.I oppose this proposed amendment.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: Mr. Chairman, I would like to comment on the</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHAIRMAN: .Order. First of all, before you do that, I would like to remind hon. Members of a procedural point. Let me request hon. Members who are going to contribute that we are in the Committee Stage. What normally happens at this Stage is that hon. Members persuade the Minister responsible for a particular Bill on one line or another. Otherwise, we might go deep into a lengthy debate and then there will be no solution.Secondly, we are dealing with the Schedule. For that reason, I will be putting the Question in due course. Yes Mr. Shikuku.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: While thanking you for that guidance, we are now dealing with the Schedule and the Attorney General is only interested in some parts of the Schedule which he wants to amend. We have not had the opportunity ourselves to tell him what we feel about other things in the Schedule. I hope you will not put the Question, thereby denying us the opportunity and the right to say what we want to say. We are only dealing with the Minister Attorney General's amendments and he is not amending everything in the Schedule.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHAIRMAN: Order, hon. Shikuku You are not right in that I have gone through - and that was actually yesterday every part of the Schedule and this is the last bit at which we were h±± caught in a hitch.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: Mr. Chairman, Sir, I am sorry if my memory is not serving me right. However, we have been going according to the ± amendments by the Attorney General and s we did not go through them section by section. I know, and I have been here and I do not miss even a second of this House and I did not hear us touching on the amendment to the Posts and Telecommunications Act. That is a very big and major amendment which we have not touched.With all due respect to the Chair, Sir, I now am want to comment on this amendment which has been moved by the Attorney-General. We cannot have our cake and eat it. The point is that if we believe in democracy and in the people electing the people they want to speak for them, we should realise that a commission is a sort of a democratic coup due to an emergency, which is intended to last for a given time to take care of things, after which it should return to the people their right to elect the people they want. If this Parliament is going to be used the way it is suggested in this amendment to/deny the people that right, then we, in this House, shall stand condemned by the future generation of this nation. If you look at the deleted proviso, which the Attorney General has conveniently refused to show us	He is supposed to show us what is being deleted.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHAIRMAN: He has. There is Section 252(3).</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: Mr. Chairman, sub-section (l) says "by the Minister by order, by a further period not exceeding one year". The Minister can do that forhimself and this House can push that extension for two years again. Not only that, additionally, the House can push the extension by a further period. Sub-section (2) says thereafter by the Minister, by order made with authority of a resolution of the National Assembly for an additional period or additional periods". I do not know whether those periods will be 50 or 70. So long as you can push the request through this National Assembly, then you can continue. This Parliament, then, ceases to be what it is supposed to be. In other words, the Parliament ceases to be the protector of democracy for the people of this country. But, few as we may be, it must be recorded that once upon a time there were people in this House who felt that democracy must not only be talked about but also upheld.Mr. Chairman, as we have seen this afternoon, we know that all you have to do is to get the majority of this House so as to do anything you want. But the fact that you are the majority does not mean that you are always right. I have been a loner here, even in the question of money being taken out of this country. Nobody believed me; the Government denied it, the Minister responsible denied it and even the Attorney General himself denied it. But today they agree that money has been siphoned out of this country. Even most recently a woman was found with money in her private parts. Now, why was hon. Shikuku not listened to? So, we know that being the majority does not mean that they are always right. We, as democrats who will die fighting for democracy despite what other people may say, are not in favour of this kind of amendment. The amendment may go through just because we have 88 hon. Members in the Front-Bench and 82 hon. Members in the Back-Bench. The answer is obvious, but let it be e recorded that we are not serious when we tall: about democracy if we can pass this amendment. We should not underrate theintelligence of the people of this country; they know what we are doing. I have only one hope, that we shall go to the people. We 22a may be the majority in this House, but we are not the majority outside this House.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWACHOFI: On a point of order, Mr. Chairman.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY GENERAL (Mr. Muli): I am answering a point of order, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWACHOFI: That was not a point of order.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli): Mr. Chairman, I am responding to those two points raised by hon. Rubia and hon. Shikuku. I would like to assure hon. Charles Rubia, the hon. Member for Bahati who has been a mayor in this city</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. RUBIA: On a point of order, Mr. Chairman. I am the hon. Member of Parliament for Starehe and not Bahati.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY GENERAL (Mr. Muli): I am sorry, Mr. Chairman. I would like to assure the hon. Member for Starehe, who has been a mayor and an elder man of this city that I was also a councillor in the city at some stage in the past. I know that he must show some concern about the commission which was appointed after he left City Hall, but I want to assure him mid hon. Shikuku that I would have been very wrong if I did not come here honestly and openly to say that I feel that there is a fetter, and that there will be need at some future stage, for the Minister for Local Government to come here with one or two resolutions which the House can either accept or reject.Mr. Chairman, Sir, if I came here to say remove the House from beinginvolved I would be denying this House its inherent powers. I didcome with that I only came with the only one request that have power tohear the Minister twice or three times but the decision is for the House.It would be wrong to go behind the House and do what is harmful than that.It is better to have a denial of that democracy and I am giving an exampleof the Nairobi City Commission. Rather than denying those people thisright without the knowledge of this House, that is why we are coming herewith this amendment so that a resolution can be arrived at. I do not thinkI can say anything beyond that, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWACHOFI: On a point of order, Mr. Chairman, Sir. I standto seek your guidance particularly on this amendment.	Theprovisions of Standing Order No. 70 which is on anticipation of discussion,are as See follows:"It shall be out of order to anticipate the discussion of a Bill which has been published as such in the Gazette by discussion upon a substantive Motion or an amendment, or by raising the subject matter of the Bill upon a Motion for the Adjournment of the House."If you look at the amendment, Sir, which the Attorney General was trying to convince the Committee to accept Section (3) it is very clear that the intention of the Aiitorney-Gener.al is to remove that proviso or what he is calling a fetter so that it is possible to come and discuss, then passthe Nairobi City Commission (Extension of Tenure) Bill. For that reason</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY GENERAL (Mr. Muli): On a point of order, Mr. Chairman,Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MHACHOFI: I am still on a point of order, Sir. It is for that reason that I am asking that the Chair rules that that amendment is out order. The proposed amendment is out of order and it should, therefore, not be discussed. The Attorney General should withdraw it.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY GENERAL (Mr. Muli): Mr. Chairman, Sir, the hon. Member has put himself so debased oven to the extent of under estimating my intelligence or knowledge of the law of construction. If I were to anti-cipate the deliberation of the extension of tenure of the Nairobi City Commission by this amendment, I would not bring it. I would have just keep it under my sleeves and then when you pass it, I tell the Minister: Now you have a right to extend the Commission because you have this amendment. I will not do that because I know that the Nairobi City Commission is standing extended with the authority of this House. Therefore I cannot deny this House the right to extend it or not. I, therefore, do not accept what hon. Mwachofi essay is saying because he does not know what, my indigestion is.</Newspeech>(Laughter)<Newspeech>MR. ANGATIA: On a point of order, Mr. Chairman, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHAIRMAN: I would now like to put the Question because we have heard enough of this.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

ANGATIA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for giving me this opportunity. This Bill is becoming a law and I am sure I express the concern of many hon. Members of this House, Where as in Committee Stage we discussed the amendments moved by the Attorney General, hon. Members did not have the opportunity to comment on the Schedule from the beginning to the end. It may have been an oversight or due to the hurry which we are in but it has to be noted that we have gone through, and skipped a very important section.If I had the opportunity, I would have raised the matter on page 442 concerning The Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation Act, I have very strong feelings that the report of The Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation, which came to this House under normal procedures, democratic law and everything, which went to the Public Accounts Committee was discussed and then the Report came to this House to be debated in the normal manner, is being brought in as if it is being brought through a back door, I lot of words have been used, and through that cover-up, another section which is almost irrelevant, is being added into the Act. If we have to maintain the dignity of this House and also our laws so that the rule of law, that the Ministers have told us about this afternoon, can remain supreme not the Party this is a very serious error. It is a serious error to bring in a matter that .is of "such a major concern to this country in such a manner. Instead of discussing a whole Report in the normal way, it is being brought through a miscellaneous amendment and is being made a law,Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have legalized "things that we do not know. We do not know how many millions of shillings may have been stolen; there has not been an audit report of the Corporation; we do not know what we are handing over to the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation, and we just stand here and approve and legalize what we have not looked at. I consider this as a very sad thing.The second point is that I wanted to ask the Attorney General to help us on the amendment he made the Local Government Act," section 252(3). The Attorney General explainedvery crudely about not fettering the House or the Minister.But in sub-section (ii) where he removed the word 'further',I am wondering whether the National Assemblys authority, oncegiven the first time, will be taken for granted the secondtime, the third time and the fourth time, whether will It be "soughteach time an extension of tenure of the Nairobi City Commission will be necessary. Let me not beMisunderstood because the Attorney General and the presentMinister for Local Government means well. But the AttorneyGeneral has seen a loophole which another Minister for somebodyelse who does not mean well could have used to fetter the House by usingthe word 'further'  and then the House would have no powerover it because there would only be one further extension.What resolution is the Attorney General now giving us? Is itthe resolution he has given for the first extension whichthe. Minister can use and that there will be no chance thatthe Minister will be free to make use of that resolution ofthe House many times, we were merely going to tell theCommittee to inform the Attorney General to pat in a provisionthat that resolution of the House will be sought each timean extension of the tenure of the Nairobi City Commission willbe required, and not just one resolution for many extensions.we wanted to do that but, again we did not have an opportunityto point that out to the Attorney-General. I am sure hehas an explanation which he would have given us, but we did not get that opportunity at the Committee Stage. This is whymany of us reserved our votes when it came to showing whether we agreedwith the Report from the Committee. The Report from theCommittee s did not include all the matters that we would have liked it k to be include.With, those few remarks, I beg to reserve my comments.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWACHOFI: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving, me this opportunity to also say a few things during this Third Heading.One thing that all of us are proud of is that we are living in a democratic country, in spite of our democratic country being a one party system, and things are going on well. There might "be other reasons, but the very basic reason for that is the fact that we have recognized that there is a  differencebetween uniformity and unity, and that we are united and /we live under the system of consensus within a diversity of opinion It is for that reason that one feels a little, bit saddened, when we are here to discuss something of national importance like a Bill, and then it is shouted by some hon. Members that "oh we would not like to hear any opinion that is different". We forget that the more differences of opinion we have, as long as in the end we agree, we are in consensus and we can pass whatever we pass, then we would be more united than when we have some opinions suppressed.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am saying this because</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE (Mr, Mwangale): If you are giving a different, opinion, you either leave it or say nothing.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWACHOFI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, can you hear an hon. Member before me here say that he does not want a different opinion He does not know that in fact, that is the foundation of stability anywhere in the world. In any place where you can listen to different views and finally agree, that is the  foundationof democracy and that is why</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE (Mr. Mwangale): Can Museveni take that?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWACHOFI: Mr. Speaker Sir, the hon. Minister sitting in front of me keeps interrupting me and he has just "come in I do not know what he is up to.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER: FOR AGRICULTURE (Mr. Mwamgale): I was just passing through, you continue with you contribution. I will still answer you.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MWACHOFI: Mr. Speaker, he continues to say that he will answer me while sitting the way he is. He is usually very rare in the House.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR PLANNING AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Omanga): You concentrate on your speech. Let us not suppress different opinions.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. MWACHOFI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to say that while we are passing this Bill, on that 3d: bit on the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation, I would like to give ±±s this example. If you have a crippled child and you are res¬ponsive, you do not hide that h child because even if you hide it, one day it will "become sick, and when it does h die, everybody is going to know that it is crippled, anyway. By going the way we have gone, and tried to cover up some¬thing and allowed the sins which were committed, which have been cited by the other hon. Members, to be swept under the carpet so that nobody knows, so that the whole thing is legal, in spite of the irregularities, one day, somebody wi11 have to stand up and answer for it.Mr. Speaker Sir, I do not support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. RUBIA: Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir. I rise to give comments on the amendments on The Local Government (Abridge-ment of Terms of Office) Bill and The Statute Law (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill. I would like to say that this is, in the serious sense of democracy, a very serious day; that we are "going to pass "this kind of law; the law that is going to obstruct the process of democracy and freedom in our country; the law that is going to allow a Minister for Local Government not necessarily the present one in fact as I said at theCommittee Stage, the present Minister is very niceman and we know that. But I am concerned that this is an open-ended law we are creating. Kanu as a Party to which we all belong, is very concerned about people's freedom and democracy, even at the grassroots level. It is very wrong for anybody to pretend that because Parliament will be asked to endorse the extension of the period of tenure of the Nairobi City Commission, as many times as the Minister for Local!Government brings a Motion here, that that is democratic; it is not. The meaning of local government is that the authority of that area is by the people of that area and not by proxy.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: Good point.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. RUBIA.: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to say this "with regard to the City of Nairobi. I am one of the hon. Members of Parliament from the City and I must make this point. we ask have lived with the Nairobi City Commission for nearly five years now. Under the present law, the Minister does not have to do anything more than merely extend the life of that Commission, and then come here and use the voting powers that this Government has, to push the extension through.Nairobi is very worried right now about the extension of the City Commission's tenure during which time the City Commission is going to run the city. For how long are we going to tolerate the democratic right of the people being eroded in this way?The hon. Attorney General made reference to the fact that the former Nairobi City Council was dissolved because it failed here and there. I agree to that, because I was in the Government at that time. However, let me tell you my own experience since the dissolution of that Council. The situation has gone from bad to worse under the present City Commission. The Commission is said to be almost without a penny to pay for services. That is what they tell us in this vicinity Garbage collection has gone completely ignored to the extent that even the people of Nairobi have come to live with garbage. If you go to any of the Commission's institutions for public services, such as, health centres, schools, play grounds, social halls, and so on, you will find that there is hardly any function worth mentioning. I would challenge anybody to share a meeting anywhere in Nairobi and tell the people of Nairobi that the City Commission has improved any service.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I speak with bitterness and feeling because I know that this Bill is going to go through much as I speak, but I must make this point because I belong to this city and this country. I am going to live with whatever the Government is going to provide. It is the City Commission, I will live with it. However, letme say that this Bill is undemocratic and contrary to the principles of the Kanu Constitution and to what we stand for as a free and independent nation. Thank you.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BOHETT: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I did not want to speak, but I rise lest one should believe that there is only one voice here, and that that voice belongs to the trio. I think that alleging that any member has not been given an opportunity to express his views since this Local Government (Abridgement of Terms of Office) Bill was moved is alleging too much. I think</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWACHOFI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker Sir Is the hon.Member in order to say that nobody was denied an opportunity to say anythingsince this Bill came up when, in fact, yesterday there were only two hon.Members on their feet hon. Shikuku and I arid none of them was allowed tospeak? Nobody else was willing to speak at that time. Is the hon. Member notmisleading the House?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BOMETT: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if anybody takes the time of theHouse in any given Bill or topic in this House, I would say that that is 9 s - -trio. I do not want to go further. However, I know that</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: What is the trio? Who are involved in the trio?</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR. BOMETT: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to say that lest there should be an opinion that there are hon. Members here who are more elected than others, this is not the case.</Newspeech><Newspeech>An HON. MEMBER: Who has said that?</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. BOMETT: Mr. Speaker, Sir, ire are as much elected as any hon.Member in this House.(Applause)The reason why laws are made is that people are not straight. The reason why there is an amendment which requires to dissolve any local authority and let it be run by a commission is that certain local authorities have misbehaved and gone over their own powers. Who does not know that the City Commission came about because of the failure of the former Nairobi City Council? There was corruption, tribalism, and so on. Tribalism was rampant in the former Council. This city belongs to the lot of the people of Kenya. It belongs to 42 districts of Kenya. All plots in this city belong to all Kenyans, but they were not being dished to Kenyans at that time(Applause)So, when we speak, you should not assume that we do not know what has been happening; ire only tolerate and accommodate it. We are not fools; we understand things.</Newspeech><Newspeech>R. RUBIA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I really hate to interrupt the hon. Member, who is a good friend of mine. He referred to the fact that Nairobi belongs to 42 districts of Kenya. Has anybody ever refuted that? Does Nairobi belong to these 42 districts any more than Kisumu, Mombasa, Nakuru, Kakamega, and so on, belong to them? What is the dispute here?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BOMETT: Kr. Speaker; Sir, that is not a point of order, but a point of argument. When you were talking, nobody put up a point of order.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: Address the Chair.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BOMETT: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think that we should tolerate one another. When one is speaking, we should tolerate him and stomach what he says. When Mr. Speaker allows an hon. Member to speak, then he may speak. With flimsy points he of order, we just reduce the dignity of this House. (Applause)I think it is only fair to accept that we should give the Minister an opportunity to correct whatever needs correction. Indeed, there is a proviso here that says that the Minister for Local Government can make this decision once but  that the second time a decision is needed, he has to bring the matter to the House so that the decision may be agreed to by the House. That is democracy. If this House approves something and then a tendency of saying that the matter has been approved of by the Front Bench arises, that would not be true.  I am not a Front-bencher. We should not divide ourselves into Front- and Back-benchers. We are all Kanu elected Members and we should, in fact, speak width one voice. It is a fact that some of us must be in the Front Bench and others in the Back Bench. Some of us must be in executive positions in order to run the country, but we still remain elected Members from certain constituencies. There are still hon. Members who were nominated by Kanu, and we cannot run away from that fact. In fact, we should watch matters closely. Kanu is just next door, and its officers are waiting for us. Very soon, we will meet Kanu. So, we should not forget that very important time which is just round these corner. With these few words, I support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. M'Maitsi): On a pointof order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

The first one concerns the question of the Kenya Postsand Telecommunications Corporation. The amendment being sought here is meantto bring in three things. First of all, there is the transfer of the assets,liabilities and obligations of the then Kenya External TelecommunicationsCorporation (Kenextel) to vest them in the Kenya Posts and Telecommunication Corporation,,The second step, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is to transfer the rights and the employees of the former Kenya  External Telecommunications Corporation to be employees of Kenya Posts and Telecommunications. Thirdly, any pension, rights that were accruing for the employees will be vested in. the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications. That is all the amendment is about. The same happened with the Kenya Ports Authority in respect of Kenya Cargo and Handling Services. We did the same thing. There is no sinister motive here. We are not hiding anything.' Any liability or any right that is left anywhere can. be followed by the Corporation, itself. Anybody who knows anyone who has stolen some assets of the former Kenextel lying somewhere he should disclose this to the Corporation, and the Corporation will follow up the matter as if it were the former Kenextel itself.The other point was raised by hon. Angatia and that was</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is the Attorney-General in order to tell us "if there was anything  that was stolen here and there" Is he in order to do that when he knows that the Controller and Auditor-General's report in connection with the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications was completed? That report was supposed to be laid on the Table of the House. There were many irregularities involving billions of shillings. The a Attorney-General says "if there is. There is no question of "if". That report is there. Why has it not been laid oil the Table if he is not hiding anything?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr.  Muli): Mr. Speaker, Sir, all that I said is that if anybody knows any assets of the former Kenextel lying somewhere or being held by anyone or stolen by anyone he should give this information to the Corporation. The Corporation will be the legal person to follow it up. That is all I was saying.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was saying that that matter does notsink The rights of the former Kenextel does not sink with the passing of this Bill.

Angatia as to whether or the order or resolution of this House will given once, twice or three times." My respectiful advice is this Each time the Minister for Local Government would like to extend the life of the City Commission he will have to come back here.

I want to thank you for having allowed me to raise this matter as a matter of national importance.[Mr. Speaker left the Chair][The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Karaurl) took the Chair]Sir, the House is aware that we have had attacks and Slander from our neighbouring country, Uganda. The House is aware that it is through Uganda that our young men have been recruited to go to  Libya in order to train and come back to subvert the stability of this country.Sir, we, as a country, have done a great deal to assist UgandaWe know that our President spent a lot of time chairing meetingsbetween Uganda political parties. These were meetings are asking from morning continuously until the early hours of the following day. This was done not because we hated Uganda, but it was because of love and concern that OUT- President and we, as a country, have for stability in that part of Africa.Sir, we have done this, and we have even gone further. We have assisted Uganda in transporting her goods from the port ofMombasa. What wore can one, do than that to show that weare good neighbours?	We know that as a country, we have even spent money when we brought delegations from Uganda .to this country. He hosted them here because of our concernand love for unity, and also because of our love for stability. Our Presidenthas shown that he is a leader who care a for the welfare of all people of the world.This is why he took trouble to chair their meetings. This is why he also took the trouble to try and assist Uganda in order that they could be stable.If during this struggle, the people of Uganda, under the leadership of Museveni find that he is not able to maintain grip on his Government in his country, then he should not use Kenya as a scapegoat, we are saddened that a country that we regard as a neighbour and a good  friend should allow our citizens to go through them by issuing them with passports to go to Libya to train in subversive activities. It is a situation which no independent country can tolerate. This is why I want to take this opportunity to congratulate our Armed Forces for having taken a  firm stand and a firm action against the intruders.I want to say here, Sir, that Museveni and those who think like him in Ugand should be given a blow which they will never forget ; a similar blow like the one that Dr. Kyarere gave to dictator Amin! We should not forget that if we become reluctant even for one moment and belittle this issue, we could find people invading our country from Uganda.Museveni is using the opportunity -to create  trouble at the border. He is using this opportunity so that he can create a chance for the elements he has trained to cross the common border and create trouble in our country. SO, Sir, we should be on the alert. It is the duty of every Kenyan, both along the "border and far away from the border to be vigilant in order to ensure that our stability is not interfered with. I know there are some people in this country who are applauding whatever Museveni is doing because we still have Kenyans in this country who are still hoping that the day will come when they will successfully create trouble and take over the leadership of this Government. It is these elements that we must guard, against; it is these elements that we must tell our people to be on constant look out for. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I believe that this National Assembly has a duly to back his Excellency the President in all "the measures he has taken to deal with the situation along the border. We stand absolutely behind him and we would like to assure him that whatever action he is takings military or otherwise, has the support, not only of this House, but of all the people of - goodwill in this country  who care. With those few remarks, I beg to move.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE VICE-PRESENT AND MINISTER FOE HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. Kibaki): Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in seconding this Motion, I would like to say that in this matter, there is not Front or Back Bench. We are all elected representatives of the 22 million Kenyans and we speak with one voice as a Parliament and say that all that Museveni is trying to de is to divert the attention of his own people by creating an imaginary enemy. Amin tried it and all the dictators in the world have tried it too they have never succeeded. I think as Kenyans, what vie want to do, is what the Government has already done, mainly, to remain prepared, so that whenever	Museveni tries, in any way, to cross the border of this nation, then firm action is taken immediately with good-result.	Sir, those solsiers the National Resistance Army (IFRA.) in Uganda are very naive. It is very naive really for any group of guerilla fighters to imagine- that they can destabilize kenya. In fact, if the case was not so serious, you would feelsorry for them. It is so naive that it is unbelievable that any one -would, imagine that a country as prepared, stable and united as Kenya - where both the police and the armed forces are efficient and where the citizens are prepared to defend their borders  can stabilized by a few fellows who have been schooled by Libyans. This is total ignorance and I think they are so naive to do so.However, that is not an excuse. When they try to cross the border, we will have to take action. Personally, I believe that is the proper and effective answer to them.  I am saying this because before they dare again to cross the border, they will have learned a lesson. If they attempt to cross the bordera second time, then let them learn the same lesson. There is no point in trying to set up little camps at Tororo or anywhere else, because we in Kenya have no interest in Uganda, and we are not going to initiate any business of crossing the border. We are happy to be developing this country, but on the other hand, we are ready always to defend it.Sir, as we speak here, we know that we have allowed Ugandan refugees to cross into Kenya because they are genuine refugees, and we are bound by international conventions. Uganda cannot pre tend to be pursuing refugees because no civilized person pursues refugees, you leave them alone. In fact, it is not their wish, to be away from their country and they would like to be back a home However, if the Ugandans want to have that excuse, it will not be allowed. A point of sure importance to remand the Ugandans is that Kenya has always had the means to bring their system of economic operations to a standstill very quickly. We are capable of doing that very quickly, indeed.ITobody has wanted to punish Ugandans because poor people are not guilty. Ugandans are not guilty; they have just been ruled by one dictator after another. Ugandans themselves have not had the chance to choose their leaders as we do in Kenya; we choose the leaders who will govern us. Ugandans have not had the opportunity to do that, and it is for that reason only that we, Kenyans, must remain with that consciousness that there are seven million Ugandans who have never known peace and who keep on suffering.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, if those ruling the poor Ugandans want to use their present opportunity to go into adventure, we must tell them that adventure is not for this century; it used to be for the last century. If Ugandans want to do anything useful, they should look into their own internal situation.Finally, let me say what I have always said, that the greatest defence that Kenya has is Kenyans. Libyans, or Libyans through Ugandans or anybody else, cannot distabilise us if we  remain strong and united under one leader. They cannot do that if we operated together and refused to be misused. So, let us look at our own internal affairs as we also look .at the external affairs. Internal vigilance is as important as external vigilance. We should not have any persons who, by any guise, axe operating in liaison with those foreigners who would like to distabilise us. I am sure that under the leadership of our President, we shall always succeed.. Uganda and Libya know that and it does not matter, what they try to do. We thank our own Police Force and Armed Forces.Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech>(Question proposed)<Newspeech>MR. BARNGETUNY: Ahsante" sana, Bw. ITaibu Spika wa Muda, kwa kunipatia nafasi hii ili nizungumse juu ya Hoja hii. Kwanza, nataka kutoa shukrani lcubwa sana kwa mhe. Mbunge ambaye aliiwasilisha Hoja hii hapa Bungeni.Kama Wahe.

OTWANI: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to contribute to this Motion. I am the Member for Parliament for an area that is now experiencing a lot of shooting. I would like to inform the House and this nation THAT both Museveni and his enemies, as we view them, are out to use us in some way or another. Both Museveni and his enemies - the ones he calls rebels - would certainly wish to see us disrupt our peace and development. I have experienced that none of them - Museveni and his rebels - will appreciate whatever sacrifices we make to help them come back to stability if there is ever such a hope in Uganda. We must do all we can to leave these people sort out their owndifferences. This is because we stand to lose heavily by any move that isnot in our interest as we are obviously arc going to gain nothing. I wouldlike to say that those of us who have been at the border and have observedwhat goes on, know that initially Museveni and his men had set aside almost 100 kilometres of ground along the Kenya Uganda border between Tororo and Moding'along the Malaba River, We though the aim was to have an empty zone within which they could monitor the so-called rebels. We thought they would deal with their, within that empty zone. It is empty up to now; there is not even an animal nor a chicken there. We do not understand why he Should claim that these fellows are operating from Kenya. They are not there. All we have in Kenya are very innocent children, old women and men. We do not- have any active young men in Kenya to invade Museveni. If they were there, he was supposed to contain them in that empty zone.He has told us that he has actually contained them. So, the excuse of pursuing rebels is lame this is mere provocation with the aim of getting us involved. Once we get involved in this affair, Museveni may honourably get out of Uganda. I suppose that it would very honourable for him to be kicked out by Kenya. In that event, the rebels in Uganda will be very happy because we will have helped them to win whatever they have been struggling for all this time.So, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would wish that whatever happens, we uphold our Kyay. Philosophy and go by the principles of our foreign policy,. We should completely avoid sacrificing our peace, people and resources. I would propose that if any invaders continue coming in, we beat them up at the border. We should not go beyond the necessary stage. Our regular police and Administration police are already enough to beat the invaders up. I think we should continue to hit them there and avoid going to solve their problem in the interior. Honestly, we cannot afford the latter.Finally, I think we still have to do a little job in rounding up Ugandan spies who come in all forms - traders, and so on. I think we also need to round up a few more Libyan agents within Kenya.With that, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to support</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY AM) REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Biwott): Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir I think 'this Motion has come at the right time. We need to demonstrate that Kenya is one and that, by resolve, it is a nation that cannot be threatened, provoked or played with. The fact that Parliament has taken up this issue today gives a clear signal to foreigners that Kenya is not the place they think it is. This is a secure country where people value life and security. The people of Kenya will go to any length to defend the security of the country and uphold its ends by all means.What has happened at the border is shameful to those who thought that Kenya was what they thought. However, I believe what an hon. Member mentioned earlier here0 Maybe Ugandans are completely out of control in their own countryand are now seeking our involvement. They think that  by provoking us, they will be able to get sympathisers to come and solve their problems for them. If that is the case, it is a mistaken one because we are not here to be used in any of their misfortunes,,Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I was listening to the British CorporationBroadcasting Corporation last night, and I was surprised to find that even the Corporation is inclined to thinking that Kenya, was  in any way at fault. The commentator in Kampala said that the Kenyan police - we are dealing with a police case - went across the border to loot. How can anything be so absurd, that Kenyans could go across the border to loot? If anything, it was the other way round.I agree with the hon. Vice-President and Minister for Home Affairs,the leader of Government Business in this House, that this issue is diversational.Ugandans are diverting their own problems and trying to draw Kenya into the issueI think Ugandans should be ashamed because our President, our ownpeople and resources were involved in such great detail in  time-consumingactivities for their sake. They should be grateful for that. Even Museveni, nearwho was nowhere near at that time, should be grateful that our President, through the love of peace and the people and through the goodness and welfare of our own people, was able to bring the warring Ugandans together. What have they done now? They have abused that gesture and abandoned the agreement they made here, and they are now provoking Kenyao I think we should condemn them and really make it known that what they have done is nothing more than a show of lack of gratitude.We value life, and this is why we have "been patient. We have a President who is torelant and he is patient We have a nation which knows how to forgive the past "and lives in the future. But we have a nation that is courageous; that is not afraid of talcing any action and a nation that is firm when' its interests are threatened - when it is its own stability and its sovereighty are threatened. Let is be known very clearly that Kenyans as a whole and Kenya as a nation is firm and that none of these provocative actions should be' directed at us.With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWACHOFI: Thank you very much, Mr. TemporaryDeputy Speaker, for giving me this opportunity to support thisvery important Motion that has been moved by hon. Omido; a Motion that I believe that every Member of Parliament supports because it is supported by every Kenyan.There is no way there can be with our national integrity. There is no way there can be interference with security and then we just keep quiet like that. I want to congratulate the members of the as Armed Forces, particularly the Police, for the kind of work they have been doing	I have heard an hon. Member comment that I am supporting for the first time; do not know what is wrong with some people.</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: No. Forget about such people.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWACHOFI: What I am saying, Mr. Temporary Deputy Sir, is that there is no way those who are in Uganda, purporting to be leaders of that country, can expect or can  believe that they have the capacity to distabilize this country. What we said earlier in a different Motion is that we live in a situation of democracy and I said that the pillar of thatdemocracy is the fact that we accommodate diverse opinions andfinally,' we come into a consensus. That is why I want to agreewith those who have spoken earlier that we need to maintain that unity; that. we need to "be strong at home. At a time like now when we are preparing ourselves for other very important national duties like the elections that will come soon nothing should "be allowed to interfer with our own unity and whatever we are doing. I believe that what has happenned at the border  some people might say it is an accident, but it is true that all wars begin like that. That I am saying is that chances are that we might have had three or four National Resistant Army (ERA) soldiers wanting to go across the border to do something at their own interest - I am just imagining, and that when they were challenged to stop, they refused to stop and so they were shot at. So, they run back and called for more  and as a result trouble steps. That is how wars begin. If that was the position - I am not saying it was. I do not have any information at all but I am saying that if that was the position, then the Ugandan authorities should be in a position to control their own men. On the other hand, if it is intended and if the decisions are being made by the leaders in Uganda, then it is the high' time they made it k very clear and declared that they want to fight and they should explain for what reason they want to do that.I want to support hon. Barngetuny when he says that all those who have been in all kinds of forces before should be prepared to be recalled in case of trouble. I know we might not need that but some of us in this House are still, young enough to go out and defend this county.	With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. N'maitsi): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.

But if it is the, wish of the House that we should extend	the tine up to seven o'clock, then the House should  say so</Newspeech> (Question, that time for debate be extended upto seven o'clock, put and agreed to)<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. Okonao): Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me an opportunity to contribute to this debate. I must congratulate the hon. Member for Bahati for bringing this Motion, because it is concerns a matter of national importance, which is also a very apt subject.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as we talk in this House, there are many people who are suffering the pains of the wounds of the bullets that went through their system; there are people who have been moved from their houses and homes; they are not living in their places at all and they are congested in other areas. As we are talking here, these things of misery are taking place on the Uganda border. Nothing is peaceful at that side, and all is not well on the western front.It is for this reason that I would like to join my colleagues, first in condemning what Mr. Museveni and National Resistance Army (N.R.A.) are doing on the border; we condemn it unreservedly: we do that. But further than that, I would like to give a warning to Mr. Museveni that he is playing with fire, but he does not realise what he is playing with. At present, we are telling him, "please, do not -hurt the people; please do not do that". But he continues to do so. A time may come when Museveni may feel the pinch of what is happening in this country.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as we are with you here, some of myUsc uc consitituents  have been abducted and taken to Uganda, Through no fault of their own theN.R.A. forces enter and have Kenya 10 kilonetres word to abduct people around the shores of Lake Victoria. This has to stop. If it does not stop, then Museveni —will coon be locking for accommodation, and I will give it to him.I declare now that I will accommodate him at the Busia Teachers Hotel at my expense He may have to run away, just like the others have done; and he may do so in a hurry. Now, I am telling him in advance that he is welcome. In Kenya he will be treated a refugee. But, at present, he is insisting that refugees arc being trained to attack his country. We are not doing that.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I call upon the United Nations Orgonisation(U.H.O.) to say that we are locking after the refugees, but they are not being trained as possible attackers of Uganda. Will the  please come up and say this, because they are looking after the refugees?Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, at present we are observing theOrganisation of African Unity (O.A.U.) rules that we respect borders. If it was not for that rule,  perhaps, the Uganda border would be different today. I have had my people suffer and die; I an not going to tolerate that for a very long time. Perhaps, it is high time that the X O.A.U. sent a mission to mediate at this border to show that it is Museveni who  has prepared his side of  the border for a war.Why is it that when foreign reporters want to 905 Busia from Kampala, Museveni stops them? He says that they cannot go beyond Kampala. He gives a Press statement in Kampala, and does not allow them to come to the border at Busia. Why does he do this? It is because he is preparing for wax on his side, and he is trying to drag us into to that war. He cannot do so. But if he ever happens to do so, then I am sure that Museveni i will be our guest in Kenya, whether he likes it or not.Now, this may happen to him, and I am giving him a warning in this  House. If he docs r± not listen now, we cannot tolerate the suffering that we people on the border are going through every day; we cannot sleep; we are shot at and harassed by these ridiculous people. He does not know who in his N.R.A. forces are his allies and who are rebels. So, in order to pretend that he has got a strong force, he sends his rubble to the border and tells them "shoot eastwards; you will be shooting into Kenya whenever you shoot eastwards". Some of them even did not know they were in Kenya when they were in Busia Town. They thought that they were still in Uganda. That is how liberal our people at the border are. From now on, our border people must make sure that nobody crosses, unless he has got a visaMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we would also like to know why the Uganda High Commissioner is holding conferences every night in his house atNwitu Estate. Every night about 20 or 40 motor-vehicles go to his nouse in Mwtu state.Mr. Temporary Deputy  Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Dr. Onyonka): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute to this very important Motion.Sir, the truth is this; we are dealing with a government that seems not- to appreciate the rules of the game. For instance, it appears as if the Ugandan government does not know what national boundaries mean. I am not surprised to hear that they have been operating in an open space in the bush they learn to thinking that  Kenya is part of Uganda. Kenya is not part of Uganda. Kenya is a sovereign and Independent state with defined boundaries. The Uganda government seems to have decided that by deceit and the because of the gun will make things work for them.Sir, we have experienced a typical case in international relations of what we call provocation. It appears that the Ugandan government is trying to export their domestic problems to us, but Kenya is not interested in importing those domestic problems of theirs. It is quite clear that they have adopted the classic sort of approach; when a country is faced with internal problems it tr9-s to seek an external enemy to divert attention from the domestic situation.(applause)Frankly, Kenya has not done anything to provoke the. sort ofsituation that has developed in the border. Here is a bunch ofpeople - the National Resistance Army soldiers - roaming aroundthe area as if Busia District was part of Uganda. As far aswe are concerned, we have defined boundaries and as  a matterof policy, we have made it quite clear that we are going to defend those boundaries at any cost, because we think we are dealing with people who do not have any respect or regard for 	other countries boundaries. Further more, if they have an ideologyor a policy, we are sorry, we are not the guinea pigs on which to experiment those ideologies and policies. Mr. Temporary Deputj' Speaker, Sir, the problem suspect thereis that it is Libyan commanders, who do not seem toknow where the boundaries are because they do not know thegeography of East Africa. So, they seem to think that Busiais part of Uganda.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have learnt a lot of interesting information from the Press Conferencethat the  ugandans President held, and it is quite clearthat the statement contains nothing but petty lies. The samelies we have had to listen to so many times of Ugandans beingharassed,being prevented from tranporting their goods,and many other accusations. If we were to narrate what is happeningto Uganda internally, I am sure the whole world would weep.But the truth of the matter is that we do not wish to be  party tothe genocide that is being committed in that country, and it is also true that the only Ugandans that we have here aregenuine cases refugees who have sought  "asylum in campssimply because they are running away from the terriblesituation prevailing across the border. We feel that it is almost an insult to be told that Kenyan soldiers have gone to loot in Uganda. They cannot loot empty buildings or empty shops. They cannot loot empty gardens, classrooms or even hospitals. This appears to be an act of desperation; they are tryi_ng to seek justification for interferring with our internal affairs.Sir, there is a great deal that can be said about the prevailing situation because,it is quite clear,  Uganda is seeking an excuse to confront Kenya.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the whole world knows that this country has sacrificed a lot in helping Uganda.' Look at the chain of leaders who have gone through Nairobi into the Republic of Uganda and out of the Republic of Uganda, the following  week, month or year. All of them  have passed throughNairobi. But we have been very patient and considerate. We havepersevered, and sacrificed. Nevertheless, what do we get in return? We are kicked on our mouth simply because we have been reasonable men; considerate and prepared to assist other people purely on the basis of humanity. We are not interested in interefering in the internal affairs of Uganda.' We know that the situation is immensely complicated.' But why then should they want to import more problems if the situation is so difficult? Me Mr. Museveni himself knows this. If you look at the list of things he was talking about in his Press conference, I would say that the people of this country would stand up and say "No, No, to Museveni." Let him fight it out in Uganda but e not on Kenyan territory</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTISO: . Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, Let me also join my colleagues who have spoken on this very important Motion. There is an English saying which says "People living in glass houses should not ±r throw stones. Mr. Yoweri Museveni knows that Kenya has done a lot in terms of assisting Uganda." In fact Kenya has been feeding Ugandans.' Uganda is a landlocked country and all its imports and exports must pass through Kenya. Because of our generosity we have served that country. This is a country whose  economy is in shambles; it is in a total mess. Sens How can a country in that condition, if its leaders are in their right senses, dare to provoke a_country like Kenya, which is so peaceful and which is in a stronger position to repel any military agression, against it?As the Hi raster for Foreign. Affairs has just said, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Ugandan Government is trying to turn the attention of its people from the internal problems facing the country to something else. They are looking for an excuse to invade Kenya so that by so doing they can win some external support. But that is impossible.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, since the fall of Kabaka-Mutesa the that country has never seen peace. That country has nev_er concentrated on development activities of whatever nature. It is a day-dream for them to imagine that they can dare challenge Kenya.' But I would like to say, as many other  speakers have said, that we should not take these things lightly. An enemy is an enemy no matter how small he appears.' You should never belittle your enemy. Let us be united. Let our armed forces be alert and be prepared for any eventuallity because we do not know who might have engineered this thing. We do notknow who has encouraged Museveni to provoke Kenya. We know that Uganda is not in a position to fight a war even for one month.Sir, to start; a war, it is not a joke. Even if they are being backed by Gaddafi, but they have to have' their men, food and everything They have to have materials. But we know that they lack these things. However, let us show them that we iri Kenya love unity of our neighbours We also love peace and we want chat understanding. But whenever our internal peace is threatened or challenged, then we are prepared to defend it by taking repulsive steps and actions to show them that we are not people to play with.With those few remarks, Sir, I beg to support the Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

SPEAKER: Dr. Omamo not here? Next Question.</Newspeech> Question No.802<Newspeech>MR. WAGURA asked the Minister for Lands and Settlement:-(a) how many Settlement Schemes and Co-operative	Society farms in Nyandarua District have been issued with title deeds; and             (b) When the others are going to have their title.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS AND SETTLEMENT (Mr. Muturia Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(g)	Thirty six settlement schemes consisting of13, 525 titles have already been registered, and 7,736 title deeds have already been issued to the land owners. So far, only one co-operative society farm has been registered and the title deeds are being proccessed.(h)	Survey work is in progress in the remaining settlement schemes and the co-operatives society farms and, as soon as it is completed, the land owners will get their title deeds.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAGURA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while thanking the Assistant Minister for his reply, I think the land owners have waited for quite a long time, and t3«E he is saying that the title deeds are being prepared. When will they using to be ready?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTURIA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are very many settlement schemes said co-operative society farms in Nyandarua District, and we are working on them. For, example, we have Kipiriri Division which is registered and has five settlement schemes, namely, Malewa, Kipiriri, Wanjoni, Mumui and Turasa./In Kinangop Division there are about 18 settlement schemes. In Ndaragwa Division there are about 10 of them. In 01 Kalao Division they are over 10, and in 0l jororok Division they are about five. All these farms are big and, survey work being not very easy and the survey personnel being not enough because there are also other areas in the country which have co-operative society farms and settlement schemes which also need to be surveyed, we are doing our best. So, I would like to tell my hon. friend that we are "busy working in Nyajidarua District and soon as we complete surveying the remaining land, title deeds will be issued.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR, WAGURA: On a point of order? Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister is misleading the House. Some of those settlement schemes were started 20 years ago. The production of milk in Nyandarua District would have increased if the farmers had been issued with the title deeds. Could the Assistant Minister assure this House that all those settlement schemes which were started more than 20 years ago will get their title deeds immediately?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTURIA: As soon as the survey work is complete, they will get their title deeds; we are already working on them.</Newspeech>Question No.812<Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Dr. Chibule not here? next Question.</Newspeech>Question No. 813<Newspeech>MR. MUNYAO, on behalf of Mr. Kiliku, asked the Minister for Health(a)	How many patients have been transferred for treatment to Mombasa Hospital, Pandya Memorial Clinic and the H. H. Aga Khar Hospital from Coast General Hospital between 1st January,1987 and 11th November, 1987;(b)	What the reasons for these transfers are	(c)	Whether the Government surgeons charge the patients , for the treatment after the transfer; and(d)	If the reply to part (c) is yes, whether the Government reimburses the patients for the treatment.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. arap Cheboiwo): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(d)	Government hospitals do not transfer patients to private hospitals. However, during the period in question, a total of 18 patients moved from the Coast General Hospital to the three private hospitals on their own accord, these were, thirteen patients moved to Pandya Memorial Clinic three patients moved to Mombasa Hospital two patients to H.H. Aga Khan Hospital.(d)	Patients transfer to private hospitals due to the persistent congestion at the Coast General Hospital.(d)	Yes, the patients are charged. This is in cases where the Government surgeons have a licence to engage in part time private practice and when they are privately consulted by the patients after transferring to private hospitals.(d)	The Government has no; obligation to reimburse charges in respect of treatment given to patients who leave Government hospitals on their own accord and have consulted the surgeons or doctors privately.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DDAIDDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the Assistant Ministersays that patients have from the Government hospital on their own accord, does he know that these doctors working at the Coast General Hospital are the ones who advise the patients to transfer to the private hospitalssince the Government hospital does not have enough medicine and good facilities? When the patient goes to the private hospitals he is highly charged, and as a result; he is unable to pay. Does he know this is what happens?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. arap CHEBOIWO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government has already issued a statement to the effect that if a Government doctor wants to do his or her own private practice, they should leave Government service. Doctors should not use public hours doing their private work. In fact, it is a mistake to advise a patient to go to a private hospital if he is already admitted in a Government hospital. So, I am fully aware of what the hon. Member is saying.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUNYAO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the Assistant Minister gave the original reply, he mentioned that the reasons for transfer of patients from Mombasa General Hospital to private hospitals is due to congestion. What we know is that Pandya Memorial Hospital and these other private hospitals mentioned here are smaller than the Coast General Hospital. What is the Ministry doing to ensure that the difficul¬ties which necessitate the transfer of patients to the private hospitals are recti¬fied and that be services are properly rendered in Government hospitals?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. arap CHEBOIWO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, what the Ministry is doing to make sure that patients are' not transferred to private hospitals is to reduce the congest¬ion by making sure that there are enough doctors and drugs in Government hospitals.</Newspeech>Question No. 817<Newspeech>MR. SEEKUKU asked the Minister for Education:-(d)	 how many untrained teachers are currently in Karusia Primary School of P.O. Box 71, Sotik; and(d)	for how long they have been serving in the said school.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Kisiero): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Could the hon. Assist¬ant Minister tell the House why he has not supplied me with a written reply to this Question?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Kisiero): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I suspect that a there might have been some breakdown in communication between my Ministry and Parliament Buildings. I do apologise for that.There are four untrained teachers currently teaching at Karusia Primary School, which is located in Kericho District. Mr. Paul Langat, TSC No. 069716 has been serving at Karusia Primary School since 1975 to date. Mr. Peter Langat, TSC No. 06927, has been in the same school since 1974 to date. Mr. David Yapsoi, TSC No. 92986, has been at the school from 1975 to date, and Mr. David Keter, TSC No. 069963 has been in the school since 1982 to date.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SEIKOKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, arising from that reply, is the Assistant Minister satisfied that these people, having served for all this time, should not be considered to be sent in for training?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KISIERO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, these people's cases will be considered when they apply for teacher training positions or when they apply to be admitted for in-service training. We will consider them then.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LUKENDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, will the Assistant Minister tell this House what criterion is used by his Ministry to send such teachers to teacher training colleges?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KISIERO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, every year we recruit those who may be serving as untrained teachers or those who have come direct from school to go in for teacher training courses. They are trained as either P1s, P2s or P3s, depending on their qualifications. Another channel for them is that they are considered for in-service training. That is to say that they would be going for piece-meal courses while, at the same time, continuing to teach.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: Arising from that reply, Sir, is the Assistant Minister aware that I would not have known of these teachers' plight unless they had tried all the available means? That is why they ended up requesting the hon. Member for Butere to raise this matter in the House. Is he aware that these teachers have been applying for training but they have not been able to succeed because there have been a lot of tricks? Would the Assistant Minister, assure	this House that he will, take it upon himself to ensure that these wananchi, who are doing a very good job, will be taken to training colleges because they cannot get through on their own?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KISIERO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the problem has been that we have more untrained teachers who would like to go for training than the place available. So, every year, each district is given a certain quota for teacher training purposes. This is very competitive, such that some untrained teachers are taken this year and others are pended for the following year. We hope that the situation will improve when we start the new teacher training colleges which will be established in the near future.</Newspeech>	.<Newspeech>MR. NOORU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. According to the two replies given by the Assistant Minister, there is a contradiction because, in the first place, he implied that these teachers were not interested in going for training because they had not applied for the same. In the second place, he said that the available chances were limited. What is the true position now? Obviously, if justice was to be done, these teachers who started working as untrained as far back as 1974 would have been trained by now. Could the Assistant be specific enough and tell the House whether it is the teachers who are not interested in training, or it is his Ministry that does not have a chance for them?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KISIERO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the position is that untrained teachers who wish to be trained have to apply for training every year. In other words, even if they had applied before and failed, they would have to apply during the succeeding years until they are lucky to be taken.</Newspeech>Question No. 809<Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Hon. Kisuya not here? Let us go back to hon. (Dr) Omamo's  Question.</Newspeech>Question No. 784<Newspeech>MR. MWACHOFI, on behalf of Dr. Omamo, asked the Minister of State, Office of the President:-(a.) whether he is aware that fish nets are being stolen on Lake Victoria and ferried across to the neigh¬bouring countries; and(b) what immediate action he is taking to stop these thief’s.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Maiyani): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(i)	I am not aware(j)	Security officers from Usenge Police Post, Ndori and Asembo police patrol bases, have been deployed on regular patrols to curb all crimes along the lake.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWACHOFI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the two answers by the hon. Assistant Minister seem to be contradictory because there is no way he can say that he is not aware of those crimes and, at the same time, say that he has police officers patrol¬ling those areas. Could he stand up and give a more elaborate answer?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAIYANI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the two answers I have given are not contradictory, if I may explain the whole situation, I would state that in 1985> eight cases were reported, in which 208 fish nets were allegedly stolen. In six out of the eight cases reported, some arrests were made and 67 nets recovered. Some 14 people were accordingly charged, two of whom were convicted and sentenced to imprison merit ranging from six months to two years. In 1986, eight cases were reported, in which 110 nets were allegedly stolen. Arrests were made in all the eight cases and, accordingly, 10 people were charged. Eight of the accused were convicted and sentenced to terms of imprisonment ranging from six months to seven years. 	A total of 80 nets were recovered.	As at 26th November, 1987, four cases have been reported in which 102 nets were alleged to have been stolen. 12 people have been arrested in connection with all the four cases and they have been charged accordingly. Their cases are still pending before court. Out of all the nets reported stolen, 70 have been recovered.All those arrested in connection with the theft are Kenyans; none is a foreigner. It is believed that even those nets that have been stolen and have not been recovered so far are still being used within the Kenyan waters. The police and the Fisheries Department have been facing problems in identifying stolen nets due to the poor identification marks made on the nets by the owners.However, patrols are being intensified to ensure that such thefts and other crimes are curbed along the lakeshore6 and within the lake. As it has been indicated in this answer, no foreigners are involved in these thefts; they are local people.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: let us go back to Dr. Chibule’s Question</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NOORU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I ask this Question on behalf of Dr. Chibule, I apologise for coming in late.</Newspeech>Question No.812 <Newspeech>MR. NOORU, on behalf of Dr. Chibule, asked the Minister for Finace:-(a)	whether he is aware that Mr. James Kuria Mwangi, Treasury Pile No.34349, Lands Office Pile No.023577/300, who retired on 2nd January, 1986, has not been paid his terminal benefits and pension; and(b)	Whether he could pay the complainant his benefits together with interest immediately.</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. SPEAKER: No one to respond from the Ministry of Finance?</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: Mr. Thuo is there:</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR FINANCE(Mr. Thuo) Mr.Speaker, Sir, I apologise for the delay; we were having some other consultations with my colleagues.I now beg to reply,(b)	I am aware that Mr. J.K. Mwangi retired from Civil Service on 2nd January, 1986 and that he has now been paid his retirement benefits vide Cheque No.034897, dated 7th December, 1987.(b)	However, Mr. Mwangi cannot be paid interest on his benefits because the Pensions Act (Cap.189) does not make provision for such payment.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NOORU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to the records, Mr. Mwangi retired in January, 1986 and according to the answer given by the Assistant Minister, the cheque was paid in December, 1987. If you look at, that is exactly 12 good months. What are the causes of these delays in paying the officers their gratuities, and what is the Ministry doing to limit these delays of retirement benefits?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. THUO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I agree that there has  been quite long period between the time that he retired and the time he was paid. This has been brought about by the completion of various documents which otherwise had to be completed so that the pension claim is then paid without anything going wrong with the records of the Pensions Department.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: let us go back to Mr. Kisuya's Question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KISUYA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I ask my Question, I apologise for coming in late.</Newspeech>Question No.809<Newspeech>MR.

Mereka Musyoka Advocates on behalf of Miss Grace Kisuya, a claimant, on December, 1984.(b) I understand from Messrs David Njogu and Company Advocates that they wrote to the claimant, Miss Grace Kisuya and others on 23rd January, 1983 to go for their payment. The other six people involved in the same claim responded, and have since been paid their claim, but Miss Grace Kisuya has not responded as of date despite the various reminders sent to her. I would advise Miss Grace Kisuya, through the Questioner to write to the advocates concerned or go there personally and she shall be paid her claim.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. AJBUYA-ABUYA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.I do not see the reason why hon. Cheboiwo is answering this Question when the Attorney-General is here. Mayfets, the Attorney-General has lost his voice, it is understandably but if he is here, we would expect that he answers the Question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Not necessarily,Yes, Mr. Kisuya.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KISUYA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is now almost fiveyears since the accident occurred. Why has it taken so long for the claimant to be paid? There has been no letter from the advocates to the claimant and if the Assistant Minister has such a letter let him lay it on the Table of the House,</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. arap CHEBOIWO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the answer tothat is simpler I have said that there were many people involved in that accident. When letters were written to the claimants, the others responded and they have come to collect their payment but this lady was given her letter and she has not responded through these advocates. I am advising the lady to write a letter to these advocates and to collect her payment.  There are copies of their letters which show£ that she was given the letters. All that this office is waiting for is for this lady to write a letter to her advocates or come personally to collect her payment.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KISUYA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, what I wanted from theAssistant Minister is that if he has got any letter, he can lay it on the Table so that I can also use it later on.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. arap. CHEBOIWO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, these letters are there. If the file is brought to the House, the letters will be found in that file</Newspeech><Header>QUESTIONS BY PRIVATE NOTICE</Header><Newspeech>MR. MUIA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister of State, Office of the President the following Question by Private Notice.(b)	Is he aware that Mr. Slause Wambua Mwongela was arrested and taken to Kola Police Patrol Base, Machakos District in early November, 1987?(b)	Why was he arrested and when is he going to appear in a Court of law?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Kubai): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.  (a) Yes, I am aware.(b)	Mr. Slause Wambua was arrested for assoulting Mr. Kiani Ndege with an arrow on the stomach. While in the police cells, Mr. Wambua committed suicide before he was charged for the offence of assault causing actual bodily harm.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

KUIBAI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the night of 23rd and 24th November, 1987, at Kola, in Machakos District, Mr. Slause Wambua Mwongela shot Mr. Kiani Ndege on the stomach with an arrow during a domestic quarrel.

The matter was reported to Kola Police Patrol Base, who arrested Mr. Wambua Mwongela on 24th November, 1987, and placed him in a police cell to be charged with assault and causing actual bodily harm contrary to section 251 of the Penal Code.

Meanwhile a police inquest File No. 12/87 has  When the investigations are completed the file will be placed before a magistrate for his ruling.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUNYAO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. While the Assistant Minister was replying to this Question he mentioned, twice, that Mr. Wambua Mwongela committed suicide in a police cell. Is he in order to mislead the House by saying that the deceased committed suicide in a police cell in Kola Police Patrol Base, when there are no police cells in that Base?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KUBAI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the information I have. If the hon. Member has any other information, he should wait until the police inquest commences and then he can give all the information he has.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MUIA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reason why I asked this Question is that the information about the deathof the deceased, the late Mr. Wambua Mwongela. I asked thisQuestion because that information was not released until thisweek. Can the Assistant Minister tell the House why the parents of the late Wambua Mwongela have been going to	 They went to the Kola Police Patrol Base, Kilome Police Station and finally to Machakos Police Division and they were told that the police did not have any information about the whereabouts of this man.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KUBAI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have given all the information I had and I have no more to add.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Mr. Omido's Question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OMIDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Local Government the following Question by Private Notice.  (a) Is the Minister aware that Mr. Joseph Mueiaa No. C 00-60059 was summarily dismissed by the Nairobi City Commission on 7th May, 1981 vide Town Clerk's letter EO/CT/3373 dated 7th May, 1981?(b)	Is he further aware that this dismissal was withdrawn by the same Town Clerk on 26th August, 1981, that said, that Mr. Muema should be reinstated?            (c) Why has he not been re-instated?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. Marita): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(b)	I am aware.(b)	I am also aware that Mr. Joseph Muema’s dismissal was withdrawn and he was re-instated vide the Town Clerk's letter dated 26th August, 1981.(b)	Mr. Muema however, had his services terminated once again on 13th May, 1987, vide the Town Clerk's letter dated 13th May, 1987, because of being negligent in the performance of his duties as a watchman when theft took place at Onu Cresent Clinic on the night of 28th May, 1986.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OMIDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the Assistant Minister not aware that the theft which he has referred to was thoroughly investigated and it was discovered that on that material night Mr. Muema was off-duty? He was exonerated from that theft and the order for his re-instatement was given to-the City Commission That re-instated was minuted in a City Commission Minute."</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MARITA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the House gives me more time to bring more details</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: We are adjourning today.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MARITA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, Mr. Muema had his services terminated on 7th May, 1981, when the following events, took place. The first one is that KShs.760.15 was stolen from Makadara Primary School where Mr. Muema was a watchman. Also things like stapler machines and stamp pads, hand brooms and cissors were stolen. His case was discussed, by the City Commission and he was warned and asked to be very careful when performing his duties so that school property is not stolen.Also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Mr. Muema's services were termi¬nated on 13tli May, 1987, after Onu Clinic, where he was supposed to be on duty on the 28th May, 1986, was broken into and items worth KShs. 74-9/- were stolen. Investigations carried out by the Nairobi City Commission showed that he had left the clinic unattended during the time of theft. So, the question of this gentleman being off-duty, as the lion. Member suggests, does not arise. He failed to report on duty and property was stolen from the clinic.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OMIBO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, Mr. Muema had put in about 25 years of service with the Nairobi City Commission. He has a very clean record.' The theft which the Assistant Minister has referred to was thoroughly investigated and Mr. Muema was exonerated from it. So, in view of Mr. Muema's 25 years of service is the Assistant Minister prepared to go and reconsider the matter with a view to retiring Mr. Muema in public interest, since the theft was not brought about M by Mr. Muema himself? Can the Assistant Minister re-consider this matter so that Mr. Muema can just be retired? This is because he had just reached his retirement age.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MARITA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, one can work for a long time and beworking very well. But, although he had worked for a long time, it came to atime when he was not careful in his duty; that is why properties were stolen	. If it was another matter, then his case would have "been considered. But he neglected duties.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Labour the following Question by Private Notice. (a) Is the Minister aware that Jabenga Contractors disappeared from a construction site in Meru Town in October, 1937 without paying his workers Sh.31,030/- and without paying Mr. Jusuf Mucheke an amount of Sh.$,200/- arising from transpor¬tation charges? (b) Will the Minister assist the people involved to get their dues so that they may have a happy X-Mas?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. Okondo): Mr. Speaker, Sir, the answer to this Question as well as the next one, that I have received are so unsatisfactory that I did not consider them good enough to be brought to the House. I have ordered that more satisfac¬tory answers be given to me for the next day.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Minister is aware that the House might adjourn today. Now, when he got wrong answers, what efforts did he make to get the right answers so that he could answer the Questions today before we adjourn?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. Okondo): Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the answer is obviously unsatisfactory, I think it would be unfair for the hon. Member for me to come and give him an answer that I am not happy with, and which I feel is not correct. We can answer the Question the next day that the House sits; or if the hon. Member wants to pursue it during the recess, we can have a look at it.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. DDAIDDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Labour the following Question by Private Notice.(a) Is the Minister aware that Abdi Tacho Mahad was employed as a watchman by Robert Shaw MF 6 Ltd. from 1st May, 1987 to 31st July, 1987?            (b) If so, why has he not been paid, his rightful dues?   (c) Could-the Minister order that Mr. Mahad be paid without further delay?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. Okondc): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I said that both this Question and the previous one are in the same situation.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. DDAIDDO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Are you satisfied with what the Minister for Labour is trying to do? To him, every Question put to him is in a similar situation to the other one. Is he not trying to suppress the workers just deliberately? The workers have suffered, and they need some payment to be made to them. The Minister keeps on talking of tomorrow, while he knows for sure that after this sitting, we might not come back here; the workers are being suppressed through him. He has this attitude because he is also person who has many businesses. So, he does not want to answer these Questions because he also has businesses where workers are suppressed.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MUTISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. Okondo): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I {really the number one worker in this House. Everything that I have done from January up to now has demonstrated my interest in workers. In fact, this House has commended me on various occasions for doing various .things to assist the workers. This is why, when I find that an answer is not satisfactory; has a lot of loopholes; has a lot of things that do not look true, I have to check;' there is no point in bringing an answer, which is not right.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. HASSAN: Mr.Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Health the following Question by Private Notice.(a) Is the Minister aware that there is no vaccine nor medicine to treat rabies in Garissa District?(a)	Since there have been recent cases of people who have been bitten by stray dogs, could he, as a matter of urgency, send the relevant drugs to the district?(b)	What immediate preventive measures is the Minister taking to arrest the situation?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. arap Cheooiwo): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(a)	I am not aware.(b)	Enough vaccine to treat over 9O people was dispatched to Garissa Provincial General Hospital on 3rd December, 1987.(c)	My Ministry has already sent vaccine to health facilities within Garissa area, and the Veterinary Department is dealing effectively with the stray dogs.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. HASSAN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I did not get it clearly. Did the Assistant Minister give us the reply that there are enough vaccines in the hospitals, and not in the veterinary services? I as asking about Garissa District Hospital.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. arap CHEBOTIO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thought I had answered that Question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. HASSAN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, did I hear the Assistant Minister say that there are enough vaccines in fix Garissa District k Hospital. If he did say that, would he kindly repeat, because I did not hear it?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. arap CHEBOIWO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, with your permission, I can repeat that part: Enough vaccine to treat over 90 people was dispatched to Garissa Provincial General Hospital on 3rd December or this month - 1987. In (c) I said: My Ministry has already sent vaccine to the health facilities that means health centres, district hospitals and others within Garissa area, and the Veterinary Department in that axe is dealing effectively with stray dogs. I am sure that now he has heard.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR HASSAN: Mr. Speaker, Sir, arising from that reply, why did the Ministry this anti-rabies vaccine being as important as it is allow Garissa District Hospital to go without anti-rabies vaccine that treats bites by stray dogs and other wild pets, for nine months? This vaccine was not available from sometime March this year until the time - this month when he is saying that they dispatched something to the hospital.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. arap CHEBOIWO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is not true to say that this vaccine was not available for nine months, or that we have sent it because of this Question. The Provincial Medical Officer (P.M.O), North Eastern, has confirmed that for the four year, he has been in Garissa, no single case of rabies has been treated there; this includes the nine months the hon. Member is talking about. People are bitten by oxes, and even dogs. But it should be noted that one does not always get rabies when he or she is bitten by these animals. Sometime back, somebody was bitten by an animal he did not identify. He was treated at Dadaad Dispensary</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. arap Cheboiwo) (Ctd):  tow months after the incident, and then referred to Garissa Provincial General Hospital, where he was found not to have rabies. So, the P.M.O. in that area has confirmed to us that there is not rabies in that area. However, for prevention purposes, in case it comes from these stray dogs, we have given him enough vaccine and medicines.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MRS ASIYO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Attorney-General the following Question by Private Notice.(b)	Is the Attorney-General aware that Mrs. Loma Arwa Adhola was knocked down and fatally injured by a car which was being chases by a police patrol vehicle on 29th July, 1986 at Pangani?(b)	Was the driver charged and what was the court's ruling?(b)	Would the Attorney-General order the compensation of the family of the deceased who left behind a four month old baby boy?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. arap Cheboiwo): Mr. Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Attorney-General. I beg to reply.(a) I am aware that on 29th July, 1986 at 7.45 a.m. along First Avenue at Eastleigh, and not pangani, Mrs Lorna Arwa Adhola was knocked and killed instantly by a Bedford lorry, registration No. KNC 235, which was being driven by one Charles Waweru an employee of Kualum Limited, P.O. Box 12545, Nairobi. However, it is not true that the lorry was being chased by police patrol car, as that lorry was on its normal business drive, heading towards the Industrial Area. (b) The lorry driver has not been charged in court. However, investigations were carried out, and the police accident file has been placed before a magistrate, who has ordered that a public inquest be held. The hearing of the inquest has been set for 6th March, 1988.(c) In view of the answer, to part (b), part (c) of the Question does not now arise as my comments might prejudice the outcome of the inquest.</Newspeech><Header>ART</Header>	<Newspeech>MRS. ASIYO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the Assistant Minister tell the House whether it is normal for police accident files to take about two years before they are placed for public inquest like in this particular case, or is it as a result of this Question having been put in this House?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. arap CHEBOIWO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it depends on the nature of the case Even a case can take two or three years, depending on the nature of investigations being carried out. If the investigation are not complete, they will continue for some longer time. It is not due to this Question being put here.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MRS. ASIYO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the Assistant Minister aware that when the husband of Lorna went to Pangani Police Station to ask for the police abstract, he was not given the abstract. But he was told by a policeman at Pangani Police Station that unless he accepted a lawyer whom they had recommended for him, that case would not go on. It took me time to telephone the Officer in Charge of Pangani Police Station before Lorna's husband could be given the police abstract. Is he aware of that?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. arap CHEBOTWO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not aware of that. But since the inquest file has been opened and the date has been set for 28th March, next year, all this will be heard. The husband of the deceased will have to make a statement, or give whatever he wants. MR. SPEAKER: Next Order.</Newspeech><Header>MINISTERIAL STATEMENT</Header><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR SUPPLIES AND MARKETING (Mr. Kitele): Mr. Speaker, Sir, yesterday I promised to give a short statement in the House today, and I beg to do thatMr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to make a short statement regarding payment to farmers for crops that we have purchased this year. It has been pointed out that there are certain areas where we havealready received some maize and the farmers are said not to have been paid. In Aldai, we have received maize worth slightly over KSh.3 millio A cheque for KSh.4 million was sent yesterday. It was delivered to our office by our Managing Director clearing the KSh.3 million.We have also collected, maize worth KSh. 328,569/- in BaringoDistrict,and a cheque of KSh.5 million was sent to the District lastweek and payment is in process. We have done, that because we expect to buy more maize than what they have already harvested, and that is why we have sent more money to the area so that it is available all the time and maize can be paid on delivery.In Eldoret, we collected maize worth KSh. 24,116,000/- A cheque for KSh.7 million was despatched last week and the balance will be despatched this week. So, a cheque for the balance has already been despatched.In Kisii, we collected maize worth KSh.3,8l8,642/- and a cheque for KSh.4 million has already been despatched to cover these expenses, and we hope payment can commence next week or this week. Due to bad weather we are experiencing, my Ministry together with the Administration, is reviewing the situation with a view to finding those areas in need of urgent assistance.	Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I  reported to the House two weeks or so ago, we appointed three selling centres in Kitui, and additional centres will soon be added to meet the needs of the people. If there is any other place where maize is required, we will look after those places.Mr. Speaker, Sir, from time to time, I have been asked to clarify the price of a 90 kilo bag of maize. Generally in the country, the ex-depot price of a 90. kilo bag of maize is KSh . 284.65. The wholesale and retail prices are set up by the Price Controller, and they are normally published for various areas. A bag of maize in Mandera isdifferent from a bag of maize in Kitale, or for that matter, Nairobi.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other tiling I wanted to say is that fromtoday, there will be  plenty of rice, and in every depot of ours there is pice I understand people queue for rice at the office of the District Commissioners I have cancelled that today. One can go to any of our depot  National Cereals and Produce Board  and buy rice.  One will not be required to go and collect a chit  of paper from a District Commissioner from today.

I would like to read just a section of it, and I quote"Whilst these actions by the Kenya troops have been going on, the Kenyan leadership has been issuing a series of orchestrated false and provocative statements against Uganda in preparation for the current acts of aggression of these statements, the following are typicalOn Jamhuri Day, H.E. the President of Kenya falsely accused Uganda of interfering in Kenya's internal affairs and also alleged that the 200 or so Kenyan children were taken to Libya through Uganda where they were given passports. He further implied that the Ugandan authorities are implicated in the theft of cattle from Kenya. H.E. the President of Kenya concluded by calling on every Kenyan to regard himself as a soldier ready to fight the "enemy" Is Uganda among these "enemies"?"Mr, Speaker, Sir, I think it is imperative for this House to say that His Excellency the President has not lied. He has not issued false statements about Uganda,and what he has reaffirmed is that we, as Kenyar have no interest in what is happening in Uganda. What we want is to maintain our integrity and freedom.</Newspeech> (applause)<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR RESEARCH, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY/(Dr. Karanja ) ( Contd. ) :Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask whether, in the light of these kind of accusations against the Head of State, the High Commission should not be declared persona non grata?

ANGATIA: I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir todraw attention to a point of order that I raised yesterday where I calledupon the Minister for Education, hon. Oloo-Aringo, who is, of course myvery good friend and whom I respect quite a lot, to correct certain verymalicious statements he made against hon. Shikuku yesterday. Hon. Oloo-Aringo did not do so. I would like to ask him to do so because what he said is very clearly stated in today's Daily Nation. I do not wish to read what is written there "because I am sure all hon. Members have read. it. I would like to remind him of his own statement which is contained in yesterday's HANSARD and then prove to him that, in fact, hon. Shikuku was a major participant in the Lancaster House Independence. I have the relevant documents here and I would just like to ask the Minister who is self respecting, respects the truth and who respects properly researched matters; especially being the Minister for Education and who is quite highlyeducated, that he will see toit that the records are set correctly.According to yesterday's HANSARD, the Minister said in part as follows:-"There is no particular speciality in which the hon. Member for Butere is going to try to intimidate me. There axe various claims that the hon. Member for Butere was supposedly at Lancaster House but he was, in fact, in the back room . somewhere."    i think the minister will be self-respecting enough to say that hon. shikuku was not in the back room  somewhere but was participating  in the  discussion properly. Iwould like to show him the documents which i have hero the first one is a cutting from the daily nation of 26 th september 1963. it                             is titled ""Leaders see Mr. Sandys". I Will quote in part as follows:-"AfterMr. Kenyatta and his, party left, Mr. Ngala  arrived with his two chief advisers, Mr. Masinde Muliro and Mr. Martin Shikuku,to see Mr. Sundys".(Applause)Another cutting from the Daily Nation of 27th September, 1963, is titled"London talks get off to good start." It says here, Mr. Speaker, Sir,</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order! Your point of order is taking far too long. You have already made your point and ye cannot spend the whole day on one issue. In any case, Mr. Shikuku himself could have raised what he thought was against him or something like that. I do not know why you chose to he his spokesman.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ANGATIA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I raised a point of order yesterday directed to hon. Oloo-Aringo yesterday and that is why I am doing what I am doing. What I have read so far has not yet proved that he participated in the Lancaster house independence talks. I  now going to prove that hon. Shikuku participatedin the Lancaster house independence talks and thai he was not in the hack room. I have so far not proved that hon. Shikuku participated in the talks. Let me, Sir, prove that he actually participated in the ak talks. What I am going to read is not very long. I have photographs showing the people who participated and one of them is Mr. Martin Shikuku.HON. Members Lay those documents on the Table.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Hon.

He has always told Kenyans the truth(Applause)and. the world. He has alt-rays told all powers including the super powers the truth as he sees it and as we see it.

SHIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I riseunder Standing Order No. 76 which I would like to quote as follows:"A member shall be responsible for the accuracy of any facts which he alleges to be true and may be required to substantiate any such facts or to withdraw his allegation (with suitable apology if Mr. Speaker so requires).I rise under this Standing Order which has not been amended because the hon. Member for Alego who is also the Minister for Education and my friend, said categorically that I was not in Lancaster House and that I was in the back room somewhere in Lancaster House. It has been proved that I was there, participated in the talks and that I saw Duncan Sundys the Secretary for Colonies at that time.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR RESEARCH, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (Dr. Karanja): The late.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: Yes, the late Duncan Sundy. There Eire photographs to prove so. Sir, is it not only fair that the hon. Member who misled thisHouse  he cannot just says "I stand by what I said yesterday" - to provethat I did not participate in the talks? Now that it has been proved that I participated by way of the newspaper cutting and the photograph, he should withdraw those remarks. Now Standing Order No. 76 must be applied which requires the hon. Minister to withdraw and apologise to me. This is because he has proved to be a very irresponsible Minister. Can he withdraw and apologise because he told the House untruth.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Oloo-Aringo): Mr. Speaker, Sir, with all due respect, the mere fact that a photograph appears in a newspaper, doe3 not prove that one is inside and participating at a conference. I wonderwhat sort of logic that is. This is because the mere fact that a photograph appears, does not itself prove that you actually participated in the conference. I stand by what I said yesterday. HON. MEMBERS  Shame on you!</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Can I be allowedto make a statement? If I am proved wrong shall I also be in order to refuse towithdraw? This is because it has been proved that the hon. Member was wrong. There are photographs to prove that. Some hon. Members like hon. Huliro and hon. Matano who also attended the Lancaster House Conference with me can bear me witness. However, although it has been proved that.

Members will recall that in march last-year, I came to this House to seek permission of the House for the a extension of the life of the Nairobi City Commission for one year, This permission was accordingly granted, and this period of one year, will, therefore, expire on 31/3/88. It explained to the House the reasons for the extension as we saw them as the Government at that time0 However, the situation about the future administration of the Commission has changed since then. Accordingly I am now requestinganother extension of two years.The reasons for this requesti for the  extension are as follows: Sir, the Government has embarked</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. ANGATIA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We can hardly hear what the Minister moving the Bill is saying There is a lot of noise in the Chamber especially in the Front Bench.</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: They are not used to being here.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Hon Members, you can consult each other quietly Otherwise, Mr. Mudavadi, you may continue.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. Mudavadi): The Government has embarked on very comprehensive programmes to improve the management of this City before handing over the responsibilities to an elected council. When the Commission took over rates due to the City Council were not being collected and, therefore, a lot of money was owing to the council. As a matter of fact, the amount due to the Commission in lieu of rates stood at KShs. 0.5 billion. As the residents of the Nairobi had raised objections to the former City Council of Nairobi On the new rates, the residents could not pay the money to the Commission.  Sines Therefore, the defaulters waited until  an evaluation court was appointed to hear all the cases of objection.As the residents had raised the objections; the former City Council ofNairobi could not collect these rates. During the life of the Commission, we have set up an evaluation Court which has started collecting these rates in order that the Commission may become financially viable.The Government cannot, therefore, interrupt this exercise until it is over.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have already informed the public and this House that in order to make kiosks operate under hygienic conditions, I ordered for two types of model kiosks to be producedhanded over to me for implementation. These two types of kiosks; one was suitable for the city centre and the other one was suitable for the Eastlands and the Industrial Areas. These two types of kiosks, will make this City look clean and decent. It is the duty of the Government to see to it that these types of kiosks are used by wananchi.Some of our donor countries and organisations, for  instance, the World Bank, the African Development Bank, and others who are already here in Kenya,have been checking on the development projects which have been funded by them. In their comments, when I met them, they daid that the Nairobi City. Commission has done better than the former Nairobi City Council (N.C.C.). They however, said that there is still  more room for improvement on financial matters.We have heavy loans guaranteed by the Government," including or Chania phase  the supply of alert in this City. Due to the ever increasing demand for water in in the City, we reckon that unless Chania Phase III is implemented now," in 1995 or before that the City of Nairobi will run short of water. We have," therefore, gone ahead to "buy land in Thika for building a large dam. This has cost us shs.53 million. This project has been  guaranteed by the Government and it is going to cost shs.2.7 billion. Since it is the- responsibility of h the Kenya Government we must implement the project,		In this town, we have had problems with The Kenya Bus Services Limited. Indeed," everytime they have come to ask us toIt is in this regard that His Excellency the President decided to provide Nyayo transport. The National Youth Services is doing a good job to ease transportation problems in Nairobi. I have given instructions to The Nairobi City Commission to get more buses to reinforce the "buses now operated by The National Youth Service. These buses have been provided by two donor countries The commitment is actually in the Government hands.  Government must, thereofore, make sure that even the spare parts that are bought are not sold by the staff of the Commission as it did happen in a garage in the Industrial Area, belonging to the City Council where spare parts were bought, and then sold in River Road. It is the duty of the Government to avoid this sort of thing.Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have the problem of garbage collection in the City. Government has already made arrangements for vehicles to be provided. Government to governments arrangements or agreements have been made for vehicles to come to Nairobi to collect garbage so that we can do more than we are doing today. This extension is, therefore, not discriminating anybody or barring the Nairobi City Council from being reconstituted. It is because the question of principle that the Government has embarked on this programme. We want, as a Government, to see all these problems that I have raised here, solved so that our people in Nairobi can have better transportation and live in better hygienic conditions.If the Commission is financially viable then all the complaints I heard of from one hon. Member yesterday, that the dispensaries and the halls are not looked after will not arise again. With an improved system of collecting the revenue of the City Commission, we should also be able to improve the services of this City. I think it  was mentioned yesterday that Nairobiis a concern of everybody, not necessarily to those members who live in the City. Whatever happens in Nakuru or Mombasa can either damage or improve the image of the Government of Kenya. This being the capital City of this country, we should pay more attention to the affairs of Nairobi than any other part.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have many more other points to bring up to justify my request for the extension of the Commission's life for two further years. When Parliament is dissolved next year, and we hold Parliamentary, Presidential, and Local Authorities elections,the life of Parliament will not be  of two years, it will he of five years. I think the hon. Members ought to give me a chance again to see whether I can make more improvements by providing better services to this City.		Mr. Speaker Sir, with those few remarks, I beg to move.</Newspeech>End I	 <Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-Generaral (Mr. Muli): Mr. Speaker, Sir? I beg to second and continue the Constitutional and legal machinery  of this Bill  as I am required to do, and also to assure  hon. Martin Shikuku that I stand here by the Constitution which I am supposed to advise on every  day. Therefore, this is  a continuation of what we were doing yesterday in reading section 252 (3) of the Local Government Act What there is, at the moment, is that the Minister has the power to revoke so to speak  any local authority and, thereby, constitute what is known as a commission. If he does so, the commission is required, by law, to continuefor two years, but the Minister is given one more bite of the	cherry, to extend the tenure of that commission for a further one year. Inrespect of Nairobi, that has been done, and the Minister has		had his second "bite of the cherry". Therefore, he cannot "bite"the third time. In order for him to be able  if it is necessary  to extend the tenure of the commission for a further period beyondthe three years, this House has  a right to intervene andlisten to the  case for such an extension. The reason forthis is that a council is the body that is normally operated and run by elected persons, and they havea right to direct what should be done within their respective jurisdiction. It is only in the unusual circumstances that that liberty should be denied. That is why  there is  restriction that the Minister cannot have a free hand, all the time, to extend the tenure of a commission.It is like some hon. Member put it rightly yesterday, and I bow to him, when he  said that it is more or less like a coup  that was hon. Charles Rubia.MR. RUBIA: Say it again.	</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli): It is actually moreor less taking what you might call a  Constitutional right away from  the council. Therefore, that Constitutional right must not be  denied indefinitely unless there is a good reason and a good cause why that liberty to the council should be denied. Therefore, that is why the Minister is given that one chance of extending the commission by only one year. If that one year expires, he cannot extend the life of the commission at his own volition; he must come to this House - which is a representative House  in order to satisfy it that that commission must really continue. There should be a good case for the continuation. In this respect, he did so, and this House did give a resolution in 1985 that the Nairobi City Commission should extend for a further period of three years.Mr.Speaker, Sir, I tried to argue yesterday to show the House that the Minister has exhausted his power to extend the life of the Nairobi City Commission any more. I tried to argue on the construction and interpretation of the section, to show that  I think the House should not have fetters. That is why I moved that amendment yesterday, and I must assure the House that that amendment is not meant to extend the tenure of the commission of Nairobi at all. I respect the House, and I think the House, having given the commission that extension by resolution, it cannot be done by  any other person  except by this House. Again, I cannot advise the Minister to come by way of a resolution, because there was that fetter the House could only do it once. In future, the House may do it twice or thrice but at the present moment, the House can only pass one resolution. I think  I convinced the House when the amendment went through yesterday, that that was the correct position.In order to "be able to invoke the House for a further extension of the Nairobi City Commission, and in order to give the House a chance to be convinced that there is need for it, I am afraid I had to come, not by way of a resolution, but by way of a substative Bill which will, if approved, be  an Act of Parliament, to extend that period.The Minister has given the reason for moving the Second Heading. My purpose here was only to put the legal position, as it is, as to why I had to come by way of a Bill, as opposed to a resolution. I have said that a resolution could not come because in my interpretation, which I think is very correct, the House could only do it once. But in future, if the amendment which we passed yesterday becomes a law, the Minister can come back once or twice, under, a resolution, but now he cannot do that. That is why I have come by way of a Bill. It is a short Bill, but then it gives the Minister power, by this Act of Parliament, by notice, to ES extend the  period for a £ further two years. . The reasons.have been given and,, no doubt, the House will consider them, because I thinkthey are very convincing and very, persuasive, in deed, thatthis House will give this Bill a chance and give the Commission further life  a tenure of two years - to see whether it can  reorganize itself before it is returned to elected members who will run the council, just like any other council. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second.</Newspeech> (Question proposed)	<Newspeech>MR. OMIDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I stand to support the Bill Any good Government is based on the good foundation of its local authorities,. Our democratic principles and rights have "been based on the efficiency of our Local Government, I want to take this opportunity to thank the Minister for Local Government for the manner in which he has steered local authorities inthis country	The affairs of the people of Nairobi have been run by the City Commission for a number of years0 I am on record both in and outside this House in respect of the fact that when everybody was condemning the former City Council of Nairobi, I stood up here and defended it very vigorously, I defended the Council because I thought its officers would do a good job but to the disappointment of the residents of Nairobi, things ran in the opposite direction Since the Minister for Local Government has come to this House today to ask that the life of the City Commission be extended, it is only those who created the present position who should be blamed, The people of this city expected services They expected that the former Nairobi City Council would run their affairs properly as mature people elected by the people to run these affairs for the welfare of the people, However, to the disappointment of the people of Nairobi, things did not run that way It was because of this that the Minister had to dissolve the former Council and appoint the City Commission to run the affairs of the people of NairobiThe Minister has said that the Government is bringing in money to improve the welfare of the people of Nairobio It is clear that the welfare of the people of Nairobi must be maintained because it matters a lot Hon Members of this House and everybody else know that millions of shillings were squandered by the former Nairobi City Council If that is what happened, then it is only the former City Councillors whom the people of Nairobi should blame From that experience, I believe that when the time comes, the people of Nairobi will get a chance to elect people they know will run their affairs better They will elect people that they have studied, and these should run their affairs better  than the former Nairobi City Council did and better than the City Commission does.Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us not block this Bill simply because wo wantto block it. I know that it is the kind of service that the people of Nairobiexpect that matters If these people are going to have their transport improved,garbage collected and more schools established, credit goes to the CityCommission and the Government as a whole. Who does not know that even theplots allocated for the construction of schools and recreational purposes weregrabbed and dished out among various people. The people concerned have beencrying for these services. The children in Eastlands have no play grounds  social halls and other recreational facilities, Why is this so? It is because nobody planned thought of or even cared whether these children had enough of these facilitieS What they only cared for was that they have plots to dish out among themselves,I support this Bill whole-heartedly because I know that the extension of the life of the City Commission will provide better services to the people of Nairobi and the welfare of both those who are living here now and those who will come later.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to support</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Biwott): Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute to this Nairobi City Commission (Extension of Tenure) Bill I think that if hon Members look at this Bill in its pure form and take it for what it stands for without reading into it any other motives, we will not have much to debate on The issue before us is very simple It has been necessitated by the problems which Nairobi is in today. Nairobi is under the City Commission. Of late, this Commission has set itself to doing hard work, supported by Government Ministries and parastatal bodies One of these parastatal bodies is in my Ministry, that is, the Kenya Power and Lighting Company Ltd .We would like the Kenya Power and Lighting Company Ltd. to assist the City Commission to light up all the streets we have and all the other areas where security is needed. In this way, we will be able to hand over a viableunit to the City Commission after which</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. GACHANJA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir I would hateto interrupt the hon. Minister, but is he trying to tell this House that hisMinistry can only assist the City of Nairobi with electricity when it is runby the City Commission and not by a Nairobi City Council?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Biwott): Infact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is what it amounts to in the sense that we havealready set out in motion under the City Commission If we were to go intoelections of councillors now, we would have to wait for them to be over andeverything else to be reconciled. Thus, we would, disturb a situation whichhas already been started and is in progress0 I look at this Bill purely with the interest of the residents ofNairobi at heart I am a resident of Nairobi, and I would like to see thatservices in the city are raised up  to the standard that vised to exist. At thetime of Alderman Charles Rubia, who was</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. RUBIA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The hon. Minister is making a big mistake I am an hon. Member of this House, and no longer an alderman I think he is making this mistake in a contemptuous attitude However, let me say on this point of order, that the hon. Minister knows that I am not an alderman any more He is also aware that he is misleading this House in that electricity is provided in our streets by the City Commission, and not his Ministry</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Biwott): Mr.Speaker, Sir, I think I am perfectly in order All I said was that things used, to happen in a certain way when we had the former Nairobi City Council and hon. Rubia was an alderman I do not see where I have gone wrongoI have not said that my Ministry provides electricity in the city direct; I have only said that my Ministry is now engaged in assisting the City Commission in rehabilitating the supply of electricity to the required standard. I do not see how the House is being misled in that respect I am being practicalbecause I am a realist I am also being honest because I want services to be provided</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. RUBIA On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir Because this is the National Assembly, it is important that records are put right The provision of electricity for street lighting is, as far as I know, made by the City Commission However, the hon Minister said that his Ministry is now doing it I would like him to clear the air and say whether his a Ministry has amendedthe relevant rules,</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr.Biwott):Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are represented in a committee which was set up recently to assist the City of Nairobi to restore the services. The Ministry of Transport and Communicationsis also represented in this committee and I am talking about this because I am involved as far as the Kenya Power and Lighting Company is Concerned.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. GACHANJA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir,</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKERS No  I do not think things are being done in this proper way. There is a change and certain tilings will follow in which somebody say a this or that and I do not think that is the order of doing things.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. GACHANJA: My point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that I would like to tell the hon. Minister that we would like his Ministry to take over the responsi¬bility of the supply of electricity and not to just assist because the City Commission .cannot do it.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Biwott): Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are doing  that purely for the good of the eventual City Council. I an saying this because the Nairobi City Commission does provide electricity as the hon.	Rubia said. However, it was not been able to do so effectively. There  are a lot of street lights that have gone out of action and we would "like to rehabilitate them and set up a viable Nairobi Electricity Board which is solely set up for Nairobi electricity supply. For this to succeed,we have to be involved because Nairobi is a very important City it is the capital of this nation and it is also a gateway to Africa and it is, in foot, the peal of Africa and we must see it in that respect.the reason why I have raised this issue, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is to illustrate the problem at hand, However, the hon. Minister for Local Government is not bringing this Bill for the sake of it or for any  other motive which is not for the goodof the Nairobi residents or not for the good of the nation as  a whole. It is clearly written here, Sir, that the term of the current City Commission will expire on the 31st March, 1988. We know that the work which is in the hands of  Commission at the moment cannot be Completed by that time. Therefore, rather than disrupting this work in too middle and push back Nairobi into what it used to be before, it is desirable thatwe extend that length of time for another period of two years and after that period, we shall be in a position to say whether the whole thing  should be handledover to the Nairobi people to run it in the way they feel they should run it or not we all aim for Nairobi having an elected City Council but there are certain practical problems that exist today and the progresses at hand must be completed now, therefore , we have to extend the tenure of the present City Commission so that work can be done to prepare a viable Nairobi City Council for the elected members to come in future. We have only made a further proviso that in future such Ministerial requests should be brought to this House for any extension of tenture of office, no that the House can determined whetherit shoul be  extended. or not. That, in fact, does not take away the powers of this House. So, I do 3201 really see why a straightforward problem which isnecessary to be dealt with, should create a further problem far as the hon.Members of this House are concerned. I am quite sure that those who are experienced with the affairs of Nairobi.and those who have lived and worked in Nairobi housing would like to see it becoming number  city as  far as cleanlinessa the supply of water, roads and the safety  are Theseconcerned. these should,in fact, be the people to support the extension of tenureWe- should look at this Bill purely on that basis. However, if we look at it andstart imagining other  motives which do not exist in the Bill, we shall end up with extraneous problems which we will not be able to solve and this will delay of a straight forward Bill.With these few remarks, I beg to support the Bill.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIVUITU Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir. This is a very brief Bill and I must be very brief in my contribution to it. It is a very a sad situation that we have not had  and elected council in Nairobifor  quite some time. It is only fair that the people of Nairobi are represented by elected councillors.  We living here in Nairobi speak with a very heavy heart.</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: Are you not supporting the Bill?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIVUITU  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am supporting the Bill all right butI am speaking with a very heavy heart and saying that it is unfortunate that weshould be in a situation like  we are in  today where we are forced by circumstances to have a commission which cannot claim to be representing anybody in Nairobi; a commission which cannot claim to know Nairobi. As elected Members of Parliament representing Nairobi, we now handle everything, including councillorsresponsibilities. We handle everything and this is a very heavy responsibility.I think when we talk of representation, we also say that there should not betaxation without representation. So, I would like to urge the Minister for LocalGovernment not to keep on coming to this House and asking for the extension of theCommission. Since the Nairobi City Commission was set up, it is now about four yearsand it should by now have sorted out the problems which were there. In any case, oneof things which is very worrying is that big reports are written about Nairobi.We have had a task force report, we also had an International Labour Organization Report and the World Bank Report and so on. However, these documents are never given to us to be able to understand matters concerning the City Council. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not support the former Nairobi City Councillors as a but as a Nairobi resident I feel that we are being deprived of a very important body. If they are saying that these councillors are not ready to handover the running of the services in the City to the City Council, than what can we do? We would like to see an orderly handing over. I am supporting this Bill on the basis of what the Minister said, but some of the things that have been said here cannot persuade me to support it.Some of the things that have been said here, like, "We are going to do this right now",are not quite fair. It is a little bit dishonest. Let the Minister just stand up and say, "We are not ready to hand over because we have not done our job properly". He should say so and we shall agree for the extension of tenure. I think this is a situation which I think the Minister for Local Government should look at carefully and listen to the views of the Nairobi people. They should work hard so that they do not keep on coming here to tell us that they want an extension of tenure.Mr. Speaker, Sir, when it comes to the appointment of commissioners, the Minister should appoint commissioners who know about Nairobi matters and who are interested in the affairs of Nairobi. We do not want to get farmers from the bush coming here to tell us to run the affairs of Nairobi. We would like to see people who know more about Nairobi affairs running the City Council of Nairobi. We would like to see the period of the commission to be as short as possible.</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: But this is a city of farmers!</Newspeech>		<Newspeech>MR.

We have our own problems here,and we know what they are.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. BABKGETUNY: Umezaliwa hapa Nairobi?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

We have a lot of potholes on our roads in the city and a lot of people now are getting water bills after six months. You are told to pay a bill of Shs.6,000/- after six months. They do not read your meter until after six months and tell you to pay Shs.6,000/- and they do not want you to pay it in instalments but all at once. This is very unfair.

This Order Paper is prepared so that we go by anything that is stipulated on it,but if there is an additional Order Paper, I should be told. If we are going by this Order Paper, then we are going as against the Orders of this House. The Order Paper states that at 4.30 p.m., the Speaker should call upon the Leader of Government Business to move the Motion for the Adjournment of the House.As regards the remarks made by the Vice-President and Minister for Home Affairs, is he in order say that I am enjoying myself when I am trying to call the House to the Orders of the Day? If there is anybody who is enjoying himself, and irresponsibly so, then it is the Vice-President himself.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS(Mr. Kibaki): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. We understand these matters. The Order Paper sets out the Order of the Business but as you know, you can skip one Order and go on to the next one. When the Order Paper was being set, it was anticipated that we will have finished the business at 4.30 pm., but now that we have not finished, we cannot start on the Motion for the Adjournment. But, as I said, whatever happens, we will finish the business in the Order Paper before we go anywhere even if we shall have to sing Christmas carols in this House.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Vice-President and Minister for Home Affairs has to be orderly. We should move another Motion to amend this Order Paper, so that we can exempt ourselves from this Order Paper and go to the next order which is now we sit until Jesus comes back.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order! Order, hon. Members!</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Arising from whatis now happening in the House, we can adjourn the House for 15 minutes so that wemay come back with another Order Paper and continue from there.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. M'Maitsi): On a point of order,Mr. Speaker, Sir. Considering what is transpiring in the House, could we not be in order to ask for the leave of the House to extend time and then we continue with the debate before the House?</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: No! No!</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.Standing Order No. 31(1) sets out the manner in which the business of the House shallappear on the Order Paper. Section (2) of the same Standing Order reads, and I quote:-"(2) Business shall be disposed of in the sequence in which it stands upon the Order Paper or in such other sequence as Mr. Speaker may for the convenience of the House direct".Sir, we have the sequence of business on the Order Paper for today, which has not been exhausted. Therefore, even if we argued in favour of what hon. Shikuku is saying, the Speaker has a right to direct that the business be disposed of as the convenience of the House may warrant. So, we are following the order of business as such, and that is how it is laid down in Standing Order No. 31(1).</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: You are misleading the House.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli): No, I am not.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Attorney-Generalis intentionally misleading the House. I have in my possession the Standing Order inquestion, which gives Mr. Speaker the powers to skip a particular business on theOrder Paper and go to the next one. The question at issue is that we have now come to the end of business and, the time being 4.30 p.m., Mr. Speaker is supposed to call upon a Minister to move that this House do now adjourn.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order, hon. Shikuku. I think it is reasonable today that we continue with Order No. 5. Alternatively, we can push the Committee of the Whole House further down on the Order Paper and continue from there.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: How? How?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. Okondo): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The question that the hon. Member for Butere is raising does not really arise because the Orders of the Day are set out in the Order Paper, starting from Order No. 1 to Order No. 6. After that, we have only a notice which is not part of the Orders of the Day. So, the argument being advanced by hon. Shikuku does not apply.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I would be surprised if the hon. Minister could give us any advice at all; he is not aware of what he is talking about. The point of order I am raising also includes the notice appearing in the Order Paper. Even the last time when we adjourned sine die, the notice was also in the Order Paper. If we go by the Minister's reasoning, then we would not have adjourned sine die the last time because the notice was not on top of the Order Paper. Let us be constitutional, since we claim to be a democratic country.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order, hon. Shikuku. Standing Order No. 33 states, and I quote:-	""33. The Government shall have the right to have Government business placed on the Order Paper in such sequence as the Government may desire".The Government desires so.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I agree with you that the Government has the right to place its business on the Order Paper in such sequence as it may desire, but the Government has, today, decided to place its business on the Order Paper as it appears. The Government desires that at 4.30 p.m. we should go on to the Motion for the Adjournment.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order, hon. Shikuku. I said that "Government may direct", and I have been directed.</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: By who? Are you the Government?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KANINDO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker,Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: No, no. Not on that matter again. Carry on, hon. Lugonzo.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KANINDO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: No. Let us hear hon. Lugonzo first.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Lugonzo): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will be very brief in supporting this Bill. While supporting this Motion, I want to reaffirm that we are very democratic in this country.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: We are not.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Lugonzo): Sir, we have local coucils which are running very well and nobody is interfering with them.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: May I just point out that we cannot bear too many interrupt¬ions on points of order.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: I am sorry, Sir, but this is very important. I have sworn to support the Constitution of this country and the rules of this House. I am surprised that even when I suggested that we adjourn for 15 minutes and come back to more or less start another sitting, so that we keep in the law, that was not taken. We should have done that so that we look as people who are orderly. There is no point of continuing debating this Bill after 4.30 p.m., when the Order Paper which is going to be filed in the archives of this House states that at 4.30 we should start debating the Motion for the Adjournment. I wish to register that I am not party to this bend¬ing of rules, yet we claim that we are law-abinding or that we believe in the rule of law.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Well, we are within the law.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Lugonzo): Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir. As I was saying, we are very democratic under the guidance of His Excellency the President. Those councils which are running perfectly are not being interfered with. The Nairobi City Commission was appointed because the affairs of this city were not being properly run. The commission was given the responsibility to rectify what was rather in a mess, and we have seen evidence of good work being done by the Nairobi City Commission. We feel that the work being done by the Commission is not yet completed. When that task is completed, then the City Council will be elected in the normal way.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, before the present Nairobi City Commission was appointed, there was, in a place I used to live, a lot of garbage whose smell could not be tolerated. Presently there is some fair control of garbage, although the Commission has not completed its task. However, we have been promised by the Minister for Local Government that more garbage collecting vehicles are going to come.</Newspeech> The City Commission is trying to rectify the situation which was beyond control. If the Commission is going ahead under the Minister to bring more vehicles for garbage collection, we should give it more time so that the responsibility that they were given is completed. Ever, as far as water is concerned, areas around Nairobi are receiving water more regularly than ever before. The grounds of most of the estates are now kept clean; something that was almost impossible during the time the City Council was working. We even now have some flowers being planted by the Commission. Before the Commission took over, the roads of Nairobi were in a complete mess and since the Commission took over, we have some very good roads now. Even the Haile Selassie Avenue, you can drive on</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. GACHANJA: On appoint of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.My point of order is that the hon. Assistant Minister is misleading this House because the roads were better before the Commission came into existence. Does he know that?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY (Mr. Lugonzo) : Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have used an example of Haile selassie Avenue; I do not think the hon. Member is right by saying that that road was in the situation it is now when the City Council was there. There is a definite improvement as far as roads are concerned. When the guests who came during the All Africa Games came here, they were impressed by the good work that the Commission hasdone so far. They even said that Nairobi was very beautiful, if not the most beautiful city that they had ever seen.There is one is one thing we are hoping will be done when the next City Council will one day be elected and we hope that this will only come when the Commission has completed rectifying the situation that this city was in. They are trying to do u that and if they are short of staff, they should be given me a staff so that collection of rates and other things can be accelerated so that our city can have enough funds to maintain good facilities. When the time comes may it be after two, four or six years for the Council to be elected, we are hoping that that that council will be a representative of the people who live in Nairobi. We hope that all people who come from different parts of the country and live in Nairobi will be represented on that council so that it is not a sort of monopoly of one group of people.We also hope that the kind of mess that there was about plots where plots were being dished like hot cakes to members of the council only, no longer be there and people of all parts of the country will have a fair share of the plots or whatever will be given out in this city. For that reason, I believe that the Commission is doing a good job and it is still to complete it. It has not completed the responsibility it was given and it should be given more time. When it completes the job of rectifying what was going wrong in this city andonly at that time then the Council will be called upon in thenormal way and people will present themselves and be elected.We hope that when they get elected, they will maintain the goodstandards that are being set right now by the city commissionWith those few remarks,I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY (Dr. Ouko) : Mr. Speaker, Sir,the issues before Parliament on this Bill are important and they are straighforward. I think it is important to put the issues in their proper perspective.	The hon. Attorney-General in his Memorandum of Objects and Reasons has stated very clearly that the issue is not one of depriving Nairobi people the right to elect; that is not the issue. There was a council of elected members in Nairobi. For some reason, this council was dissolved. The dissolution of that council was done in accordance with an Act of Parliament which empowers the Minister to dissolve the Council under certain circumstances. That dissolution stands to this day. The hon. Attorney-General says here that the Government has a reorganization programme but that in view of the time limit by which the Commission time expires, it is not possible at the moment to reconstitute the Council before that time limit comes - which is 31st March, 1988. For that reason, the Bill seeks the authority of this House to extend the life of the Commission by another two years so as to permit the good work being done to continue and also to permit the Government reorganisation programme to be completed. This is the point before the House. There is no question at all of denying anybody any rights. The hon. Members in this Parliament represent the entire population of Kenya. The fact that the Minister for local Government has come to this House is recognition that it is only this House that can perform this role. That itself is an expression of the democratic priciple that the Minister has come to the legitimate institution to get permission to extend the life of this Commission.The Commission has tried its best and it is continuing. It important for us to endorse this good work by accepting the request by the Minister to extend that life of the Commission and to permit the Government's reorganisation programme to take root.With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Khasakhala) : Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to support the Bill before the House on one principle. The principle is that the Minister has followed the constitutions of this country by bringing this Bill before the House. He did not dictate the extension; he did not go outside the House to ask for the extension; he has asked the House to extend the life of the Commission. It is this very House which authorized the Minister to appoint the City Commission. Having come back to us to give him authority, I am sure we should give him the authority to extend the life, of the Commission because this is our right. He did not ask another person outside this House for the extension but he has asked the same House which gave him the authority of the former extension.Anyone going against the Constitution would be an enemy of this country. So long as we stick to the Constitution of this country which has made us live peacefully; which has made us have a peaceful Parliament, we should stick to the constitution of this country. This extension is constitutional and I therefore, support it fullyWith those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. M'Maitsi): On a point of orders Mr. Speaker, Sir. Since this Bill has been exhaustively debated,  will I be in order to move that the Mover be now called upon to reply?.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. RUBIA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I hadcaught the Speaker's eye before hon. M'Maitsi rose on that point oforder. May I contribute on this Bill?</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: What you are doing is something coming aftera change. That is the problem, What you will be saying will be different from the sequence in which the Bill<Newspeech>MR. RUBIA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just wish to speak my mind on this Bill. What I will say may not be relevant to the Bill at this juncture. All that I want is a chance to speak on this Bill. After all I am one of the hon. Members of Parliament who come from Nairobi. We are discussing the Nairobi City Commission. I would like to plead with the Chair</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Carry on.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. RUBIA: Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OMIDO: On a point of order, Mr.Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Let us deal with one thing at a time.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. RUBIA: Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I sincere thank you for allowing me to make a contribution to this Bill. First of all I would like to say, at the outset, that I am opposed to this Bill with every ounce of my feelings and blood because of the following reasons. First of all it is against the general belief and principles of a democratic society. It is against the feelings of the population of Nairobi which is almost 2 million people now. I think it would be unwise for any Government Ministry to disregard the feelings of nearly 2 million people. The people of Nairobi have had the City Commission for nearly five years now. Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the Minister was moving the Bill he made several remarks. He said that reason for requesting for an extension of tenure of the Nairobi City Commission is to allow the Ministry of Local Government and the City Commission to improve the administration of the City of Nairobi. He said that the City Commission's administration is undergoing improvements. But that is a very flimsy reason. This is because councillors are not going to be officers of the Nairobi City Council. Councillors are not going to be administrators of the City Council. The improvement of administration, whether in Government, company or any parastatal, is a continuous process. This morning we read in the newspapers about the intervention of the Minister for Local Government in a decision which was made by Thika Municipal Council regarding the Town Clerk of Thika. It is a continuous process. Therefore to give the reason that the Nairobi City Commission should be allowed to carry on in order to re-organize the administration of the City is just too much. That is really beside the point. There must be another reason."Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Minister also talked about the collection, of rates. He said that rents and rates were not being collected by the defunct City Council and that there was something like KShs.500 million outstanding in rents and rates. He went farther to say that the rents and rates were not collectable because the rate payers had appealed against the rates. So, my question if we happen to be logical is this: The fact that the collection of rents and rates could not be done because there was an appeal Is that the reason why we should have a Commissionto run the affairs of this City? How is it that the City Commission is able to collect rates if there is still an appeal against the rates? How is it that the City Commission has been able to collect as I understand and therewas a time I asked the Minister to tell us The collection ofrents and rates is being done without due process of the law. The rate payers objected; a rate valuation roll was compiled and valuation forms were prepared. As far as I know, and I would like the Minister to confirm or deny this, the valuation court has never given any awards. The Minister says that because of these appeals by rate payers aboutKShs.500 million is uncollected. That is not a good reason. Whether you have a City Commission or a City Council, the rate payers have a right to appeal if they think the rates are too high. That process must be observed.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Minister also did say that theMinistry of Local Government. In fact he refers to himselfas the sole administrator of the City of Nairobi. He said that he is getting some drawings of kiosks. He is doing a very commendable job. We have appealed to him, as rate payers' and hawkers' representatives that something should be done in order to do away with harassment of hawkers. In this connection I would like to congratulate the Minister because he has been very understanding. But what has that to do with the City Commission? Even if you have a City Council you can still have the right to look at the drawings and the kiosks and so on. The Minister has got a lot of powers. He can dissolve any municipal council any time. It does not require any Commission to pass any drawings of kiosks. The Minister should look for a better reason than that.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Minister went on to say that	Nairobi belongs to all of us. One or two hon. Members expressed similar sentiments and I would like to say this: Nairobi is unique being the seat of Government. We are thereforeconcerned about the standard of cleanliness and services renderedin this City. The standards of various services given to our people in the City must be very high. This also applies to smaller local authorities. The fact that Nairobi is the capital city does not mean that the Minister for Local Governmenty as a Minister, is the only one qualified to determine the standards of cleanliness and various services in this City. I think that is an attitude which rather hinges on sectionalism.Hon. Lugonzo said that the councillors should come from all areas of the country. There is nobody who disputes that. But under a democratic system you will have to campaign and convince the voters that you are suitable to get their votes. That is not something that we can legislate for in an independent and free country like Kenya, where freedom was fought for and won with bloodshed. People should not under-estimate the intelligence of Nairobi people. If the Government thinks about the allocation of plots on provincial basis it can do that through a legislation. The Minister has the power to nominate up to one-third of the councillors. He can nominate the kind of people thinks should be included in the City Council. The Government can do some allocations. I do not want to give them ideas. They can come for those ideas if they want them. But there are ways of achieving that without reducing the status of Kenyans who live in this City. They have a right to elect people to represent them. It is a perse¬cution. It is a complete disaster to have another term for the City Commission. I have nothing against those individuals. Some of them are men and women of substance and high integrity. I am not agains any of them. But the system is unacceptable; that is all I am saying, and that is what Nairobi people say, And I am pleading with the Government to understand. Even if the Government uses its poorer to push this Bill through, which I think they will do; looking at the FrontBench it is fully packed and they will obviously use that power; I can see that this will happen. If they use that power, I have no doubt that it will go through. But I will say that let them do it knowing that 1.7 million Kenyans in this city do not want a commission. You can do that; but you must do that knowing that you will be going against the wishes of 1.7 million people.Mr. Speaker Sir, it is possible to have an elected council; and it is possible for the Minister for Local Government to do all the things he has said by controlling and guiding these people. It is very easy to control and guide a local authority. All you have to do is to be a man of principle, and obey the rules yourself as their administrator. People have talked of plots and jobs being dished out to friends and so on. Who said that that is not happening now under the Nairobi City Commission? Who said that those are the only people who can never do that? I do not want to bring - in any case there is no time - facts and figures to proove that that is going on even now. So, let us not go into that area. This is because human weakness is always there, whether you are an elected councillor, Member of Parliament, a nominated Member; or whatever you are, human nature is still the same. So, we have got to be judged as individuals in whatever we do.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: On a point of information, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: You said on a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: I said on a point of information, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and he has agreed. I thank the hon. Member. What he is saying is true; that even the allocation of plots is still going on; and not through the committee that is supposed to do so. If people want evidence, it is always available from the Member of Parliament for Butere.</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: What is your point, of information?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKU KU: What I said is that I thanked the hon. Member for giving me the opportunity. And I want to inform him that it is true that the allocation of plots, which was being done in a runny way during the time of theformer elected council in Nairobi, is still going on in the councils. If the hon.Member wants information and substantiation, - it is always available in black andwhite from the Member of Parliament for Butere.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. RUBIA: Thank you hon. Shikuku; may God bless you.</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Minister talked about</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KANIDO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. It would not be,right to accuse the Nairobi City Commission of going on with what was going on when the councillors were there. Would the hon. Member substatiate his allegation.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. RUBIA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to continue. The hon. Ministermentioned about public transportation in the city. I agree with the hon. Minister; we are all very concerned. May I take this opportunity to thank the Kenya	Government andour President in particular for the interest they have taken in providing buses.We are very grateful, indeed. This is a very important service in any urban area.So, Nairobi is very grateful. Even though, the position is still very precariousand dangerous. So, I would like to ask the Minister to look beyond Government coffers.As we understand it, the Government does not have a lot of money. But it is possibleto harness investors and provide sufficient buses for the population of this city,which is growing at the rate of between 10 and 15 per cent per year. This is fromnormal growth and immigration. So, I think the Government, on its own, will never be able to contain the situation. The hon. Minister should try to organise financiers or people who would like to do business. He can even try to organise matatus into some companies and give them some financial assistance to operate buses in the City. We need many more buses, and I would like to appeal to the Minister that this is really a service which is really in need.Mr. Speaker, Sir, he mentioned water. First of all, let me say that water is a very necessary commodity, and one does not have to be told that. In fact, the water or the medical people keep on telling us that, I think, 60 per cent of a human being is water. So, water is very important.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the provision of water seems to be coming all the time a few years behind schedule,and I would like to ask the Minister to do the following:- First, every time there is any development in an area, simultaneously, they should start working with organisations like the World Bank so that when estates come up there will be sufficient water for that area. As it is now, developments are coming up rather haphazardly in a Municipality. You will have an estate coming up near the Nairobi Dam. The question is: What about the provision for water, road system,transportation system, schools, health centres and so on? All these tilings should be considered simultaneously.I would like to say with regard to water that the Nairobi City Commission cannot claim any credit at all. In fact, I would say that when we had the City Council the water situation was much, much better than today. I am not blaming the Commissioners because it is not entirely their fault. I said earlier that the system is not welcome by the Nairobi people. But also the ratepayers, Government in parti¬cular, and this should interest the Minister for Finance especially, the Ministry of Finance should co-operate with the Ministry of Local Government and pay the Nairobi City Commission hundreds of millions of shillings that they owe them. We had a Nairobi D.D.C. meeting not so long ago and we were told by the City authorities that the Central Government, Ministries, parastatals and so on, owe the Nairobi City Commission something in the order of KSh.200 million plus. Now, if the Government of free and independent Kenya owe the Nairobi City CommissionKSh.200 million-plus as rate and rates in arrears, how do we expect the Nairobi City Commission to perform properly? I think it is wrong to be in that position that the Commissioners find themselves. I thinkthe Government, through the Ministry of Local Government, the Treasury must also co-operate in this, the Ministry of Planning and NationalDevelopment and so on. You cannot go on appointing Commissionersmerely to use them as your cover for some of these things because,I think, that is what they are being used for, in that respect. Theyhave no courage or convinction to face the Government Ministry andsay, "Pay for that water otherwise we will turn off the tap!" Theyare scared of doing that because they are nominated. That is why wemust have elected councillors in a council that is truly representative of the people.As I said earlier, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is the system that Idislike, not the people; do not get me wrong. The Minister for LocalGovernment should tell us when he comes to reply when the Governmentwill pay the City residents their money, KSh.200 million plus, whichthe Government owes! All the Minister for Finance has to do is toconsider increasing a bit of taxation on the beautiful Mercedes Benz they all drive in these days, and we get our KSh.200 million plus easilyMr. Speaker, Sir, there is also the question of schools in the City,and in the case of schools, the taxpayers, the ratepayers, the parents and so on have dug so deep into their pockets. They have provided classrooms and all kinds of amenities. But we all know thosof us who have been in public life long enough that it is very easyto provide physical facilities. What is difficult is to maintain them.Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the Minister tell us honestly and sincerelwhether the Nairobi City Commission the one he is praising is ableto maintain schools? Can he tell us in figures how much the NairobiCity Commission intends to spend in the next 12 months,or during thepresent financial year, in maintaining the buildings which have beenput up by the parents and councils?Mr. Speaker, Sir, one hon. Member mentioned about Haile Selassie Avenue and said that it is beautiful; it is good. Yes, it is good now. Itis not a wonder that it is good. We know it. I think they got a littlmoney from the Fourth All Africa Games to do a little bit of facelifting; just to wash the face because visitor were coming. What a terrible situation that you have to wash your face just because a visitor is coming! Oh, my goodness! Let us have visitors again! Maybe another road will be given a facelift. I think we should be inviting a lot of important visitors because every time we have them, something happens, and we seem to benefit.When the Nairobi City Council existed just before in 1983 when it was dissolved, I would like to assure the hon. Member who raised this point that Haile Selassie Avenue was even better than it is today. I would like to invite the hon. Member, hon. Lugonzo, to visit estates. He does not have to go very far. Let him come to my area, Kariokor Estate, just near here.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWACHOFI: On a point of information, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I am grateful to the hon. Member for allowing me to give him information I just wanted to inform him that,one, I am a resident of Kariokor, and also hon. Lugonzo is a resident of Kariokor Estate too. He knows very well that what the City Commission has tried to do recently is to paint the houses from outside and leave the inside as dirty aspossible. He knows that very well. So, hon. Rubia does not need togo on hammering the point!</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. RUBIA: Thank you. Mr. Speaker, Sir, you see how nice itis to have a constituent in the National Assembly! I thank the hon.Member for reminding me that. But I was inviting hon. Lugonzo	to visitKariokor Estate, but now he lives there. So, I do not have to invitehim there. However, he can go to Starehe Government Quarters, not very far from where he lives, and see the kind of garbage that is there. And how can one honestly, intellectually, stand up here and praise the City Commission for collection of garbage? I really cannot understand. This one defeats me; it really defeats me. Why can we not be honest enough and say, "Well, these are hard times. Every¬thing is not as good as we would like it to be". But plead with the House to agree to the extension of the Commission rather than stand up and praise something which is not praisable.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the garbage collection is a disaster in all areas of the City. For instance, just in front of my own office here near Fedha Towers, or near 680-Hotel, if hon. Members will go to the 680-Hotel after the rise of the House, as you enter the main lobby, you will be able to feel the stench of the garbage. How can we really sincerely praise them? Why can we not give other reasons for the extension rather than praising the Commission? We know they have difficulties; yes. But why praise them for things they are not doing? Why are we praising them? They cannot do certain things. I have spoken about them in other areas. I have made a case for them in myD.D.C. meetings, and my colleagues from Nairobi will bear with me.I have also done it here today. Unless you give them money, unless you allow them to do taxation, unless we give them the tax we get from the hotels and so on, we are asking them to do the impossible. But now I am beginning to have another idea, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Minister for Local Government wants us to continue with the Commission because he can tell them to shut up, and they will sincerely shut up.(applause) I think that is the reason, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We do not want them to shut up. We have already asked the provincial commissioner to make an appointment for us to see the hon. Minister for Local Government, Mr. Mudavadi. We have also asked the provincial commissioner to make sure that the Minister for Finance, Prof. Saitoti, will also be available in person during that meeting. This is because it is important</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR FINANCE (Prof. Saitoti): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I would like to put it on record that I have never received a letter seeking an appointment for me to see the Minister for Local Government. That is all.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. RUBIA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is a point of information and I can perhaps, take it to be a complaint and I will forward it to the provincial commissioner. I am not saying that he has been given an appointment.(Applause)What I am saying is that we have asked for an appointment and the provincial commissioner who is one of the civil servants anyhow, will, perhaps, use this system to reach you. I hope it will be sooner than later but we hope that he will reach you.Finally because I know other hon. Members would like to speak on this Bill I would like to say that the Nairobi City Commission is un-desired by the Nairobi rate payers. This is because the system is absolutely not in keeping with modern Africa. We have been talking of democracy and we cannot go on having commissioners. If the old councillors failed, who says that the population of Nairobi which is 1.5 million people cannot provide 30 to 40 people who can run this City better than the previous office bearers?If those of us in this House including those in the Government asked the public to give their judgement on our performance, let me tell you, they would have thrown a good number out a long time ago.(Applause)So, do not pass judgement which is based on flimsy grounds that Nairobi population cannot you, as a city dweller, with capable councillors. You may, if you like, elevate the qualities of who will qualify to be a councillor in Nairobi. We should not be told that out of 1.3 million people, we cannot get a better council. I completely refuse to accept that because it is not the case.With those few remarks, I hope that the Government will consider that. Certainly, as far Starehe Constituency is concerned, we shall keep on pressurizing and appealing to the Government to re-consider this issue even when it passes through this Parliament. I beg to oppose.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIOME: Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me theOpportunity to say just a few words on this Bill because there is no time for one to say a lot of things. I would like to say that there is no amountof legislation which can help the City of Nairobi. It does not matter whetherwe pass 10, 20 or 50 Bills but the City of Nairobi cannot be saved by legislationa commission nor a council. What is requirayis a lot of imagination from everybody - the residents, leaders and sundry - to salvage Nairobi because it is a City that is hge soon dying of its own. Cars will be sinking and will disappear to the bottom of the earth very soon. Mr. Speaker, Sir, you are going to drown very soon under garbage and your house will get buried. You remember that that was tha case in 1933 before the Nairobi City Council was desolved. It has gotten worse</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR WORKS, HOUSING AND PHYSICAL PLANNING (Mr. Musyoka): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Is it really in order for my hon. learned friend to come to a prophet of doom that he is now? He is saying that m. your car, Sir, and everybody's will sink and-that your own level will sink, Sir.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR. KIOME: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have not prophesied and I do not know why my hon. learned friend should get mixed up. I was only contributing</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUNYAO : Is he learned?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIOME: He is definitely learned. Every Ministry - including even the Ministry of Foreign Affairs - should put in a little bit of effort so that Nairobi can be saved once and for all. The Ministry of Energy and Regional Development and the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources should play a part in the provision of electricity. The Ministry of Health which usually complains of health hazards, has failed to prosecute the Chairman of the Nairobi City Commission. Under the provisions of the Public Health Act, if a persons duty is to remove rubbish and other waste matters from any place, if he does not do it, he ie supposed to be prosecuted. The Chairman of the Nairobi City Commission has not been prosecuted for all the uncollected garbage that is around this City.We have sufficient legislation to run the City of Nairobi. These people should be prosecuted. The General Manager of the Cleansing Department of the Nairobi City Commission should be in court by today. He has never been taken to court because the Minister, perhaps, protects him. For these reasons, we should not be here supporting one or the other but the residents of ITairobi. The residents of Nairobi want a clean City; a decent place to live in, good roads, good transport system and they want electricity so that they are not killed by robbers in dark comers. Neither the councillors nor the commissioners have been able to provide these services.The solution does not lie in any of these two; it lies somewhere. It lies in the imagination of our Government, the citizens of Nairobi and in the Minister for Local Government. It was not necessary for him to bring this Bill because it is not going to serve any purpose. It is only going to give him power which we shall give him to exbend the tenure of the Nairobi City Commission for the next 1,000 years even afterhis death. Shall we have solved anything?  We shall not have solve the problems. We should see whether there will be money for increasing the number of vehicles that do the cleansing. They are now 15 whereas they used to be 80 five years ago. Can we be told where that money will come from? Does the Commission have that money? Whereas we support a good Government and good administration in the City of Nairobi no matter from what direction so far as it is not that which beats people  because we know it - it should be proper administration which is well managed. The Commission, as I understand, does not have a cent or if it has, then it is not sufficient.The Minister for Finance has been complaining that he does not have enough money to run our system. He complained that, in fact, he has not received a letter from the Commission inviting him for a meeting, aid turned it down. We congratulate him for that. It means that he has ears to listen to problems of the residents of Nairobi. We hope the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources will come up with a solution to this problem.Mr. Speaker, Sir, those people from all over the world who visited this city 10 or 20 years Ago were very proud of They used to see flowers and trees everywhere.    All of a sudden, the flowers died</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.I would like to draw your attention to the Standing Orders ofThis House, as I believe in them, and so does the House. Iwould like to refer to Standing Order No. 17 which is on page7 of the Standing Orders booklet. It is under the heading Sittings and Adjournment of the House. It states(1)	Unless for the convenience of the House Mr. Speaker otherwise directs, the House shall meet at 9 a.m. on Wed¬nesday morning and 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday afternoons, but more than one sitting may be directed	during the same day.(2)	Unless for the convenience of the House Mr.  Speaker or the chairman(as the case may be) directs earlier or later interruption of business, at 6.30 p.m, or (if it is an Allotted Day) at 7 P.m. So, Mr. Speaker, the Standing Orders stipulate that onTuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays-and I think today isThursday - we are supposed to adjourn the House at 6.30p.m. Since it is now 5.30 p.m. and the Vice-President and Minister for Home Affairs, who is also the Leader of Goverament Business said that we will go on, could we, at this juncture, haveyour ruling  on the length of time we will sit?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. Kibaki) : On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I did not talk about how long we shall go on. I only said that we shall go on sitting; we shall go on having other sittings. We shall go on sitting on Tuesdays Wednesday or even up toChristmas day, until we finish the business on the Order paper. I never disputed what time we should adjourn today because it was not the issue. The issue was whether or not the House was going to adjourn sine die. So, that particular problem would not arise. we will adjourn at our usual time.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Go on, Mr. Kiome.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIOME: We are now getting into a situation where some hon. Members are talking for the residents of Nairobi - most of us are residents of Nairobi - and residents of Nairobi come from every constituency. There is a large number of them who come from Isiolo. So that we may know what they want,would we have a suggestion box</Newspeech>(noise)<Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order!Could we have a suggestion box so that opinions of the residents are sought from all over the city, so that we know whether they want a commission or an elected council. With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIPKORIR: On a point of order,Mr. Speaker, Sir.I think the Mover should be called upon to reply.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: No, we should allow more hon. Members to contribute, There is still ample time</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR RESEARCH, SCIENCE ANDTECHNOLOGY (Dr. Karanja) : Thank you Mr. Speaker for giving me this opportunity to support this Bill. we all know, and we assert here that democracy is a very important tenet in Republic, and that there is no greater place for exercising this democratic right than at the grassroot level, that is at the local government level throughout the country.Mr. Speaker, when we talk about the City Council of Nairobi that was, we  speak with a heavy heart because it was abolished because of being riddled with corruption. itis a pity that we toa have, now, to extend the life of this commission. We would have preferred to have a democratically elected council because people should, in fact, have the right to be represented by their own representatives. But since the Government has not finished the reformat wants for the City Commission in order to allow the city to be represented by its own people, we have to accept this compromise.This compromise between nomination and democracy is a compromise that should really produce better and more qualified commissioners who have the interest of Nairobi at heart. The present comm¬ission leaves a lot to be desired, and we hope that when the Minister has an opportunity to appoint new commissioners, he will appoint commissioners who are competent, fair and who have the interest of Nairobi at heart, rather fes than  people who come from miles away, and have very little in the commission’s affairs. Mr. Speaker, Nairobi is growing as a big city and its population is 'rapidly increasing. We need people who will   be able to foresee througli planned expansion of the city's services At the moment, the city's services have actually broken down, and some, of course, are non-existent. We need people who will not just be interested in collecting their travelling allowances, but people who are competent enough to know what will be happening in 1999 in this city. These should be people who will be interested, like our  President has been in providing Nyayo buses; the people who will know what kind of schools our children will need in the year 1990)Mr. Speaker,Sir, our roads are riddled with potholes and our health clinics do not have anything to show, except the buildings. We need to have people who have an interest of the people at heart.Mr. Speaker, we have spoken in our district development committee, to try and find at how the city commission can be finaneed. We would like the Minister to give an audience to  the hon. Members of Parliament for Nairobi, so that we can, in fact, tell him what is happening because the  situation is so serious. We will have a situation which cannot be controllable unless we take measures just now. It is my appeal t.o the hon. Minister to let us meet him, and if possible, he can invite his colleague, hon. Saitoti. It would be an additional advantage because we can discuss how to finance the city commission whether through additional taxes or through a kind of poll tax which will be able to give us the opportunity to develop Nairobi.Although we have Harambee meetings in Nairobi, particularly for schools, the schools are so dilapidated and in need of repairs that we need a very concerted and major input in finances for the city commission.fWith those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>MR. arap KOSKE: Ahsante sana, Bh.

I told him that when he was the Minister for Local Government and when we dissolved the former Nairobi City Council he was in full agreement with everybody.  Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the reasons were given at that time. It isTrue that the former City Council had accumulated a lot of debts Uhich the CityCommission has been servising. It is also true that Government. Ministries owe:The City Commission some money, as far as I know, to the tune of about Shs-170 million. Government has taken the necessary steps because we are aware of those arrears and we have asked all Government Ministries which owe money to the City Commission, to repay it in their forward budget for  the information of my friend hon. Rubia who has just sat down, I was sayingthat we were together in the Cabinet and he has been sitting on the Sesh chairand heading the Ministry of Local Government which I now do. So, he knows exactly the reasons why we the former City Council of Nairobi. In fact, Sir, I appreciate all the points raised by hon. Members on this Bill in uhich I am requesting for the extension of tenure for the present City Commission.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must thank those hon. Members who contributed to this Bill because some of the points that they have raised here this afternoon will be very useful to me. I need not refer to all the points raised so far but I am aware of the fact that if the tenure of office of the City Commission is extended, I will have to reconsider some of the points viiich have been raised by hon.

I am saying this because soma of the points be raised are an eye opener to ma as Minister for Local Government, I would liketo assure ths Assistant Minister that whatever he has said during his contributionto this Bill has been taken note of and, indeed, all other points raised by other hon.

Member is categorised into either agricultural land or urban land. In this  regard, there exists a legislation regulating transactions related to agricultural land. The Land Control Act (Cap. 302)  Section 2 prohibits the sale of agricultural land to in all urban . Ail amendment to Section 2 of the Act was enacted in 1987  to include agricultural land in all urban areas. However, there is no legal provision prohibiting the sale of non- agricultural land to foreigners. In order to safeguard the interests of Kenyans in respect of non-agricultural land, my Ministry is reviewing the issue with a view of  finding out the implications of enacting a similar provision as Section 2 of the Lands Control Act extending the prohibition  of sale of all land to foreigners unless exemption to do so is obtained..(b) Any squatters who might have been rendered landless a_s a result of foreigners buying l and at the Coast would be  considered through the normal process of settling the landless people, that is, they should apply for consideration along  with other landless persons as and when land becomes available.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NDZAI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are some land owners in  Malindi sub District who are selling their landto the  foreigners. Would the Assistant Minister tell this Housethe steps he is going to take to .that the land .owners sell their land to the squatters instead of sellingi. it to the  foreigners.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTURIA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think I have s answered this Question properly. I said that the Land Control Act was passed  in this House stating that wherever there is agricultural land in the urban areas, it should not be sold to the foreigners,  and this was to control the sale of k the land.IK	tyBut, if a particular town is not under this Act.'. agricultural land, then we have no control. I have indicated in my answer  that the Ministry is jiiaa planning to look for a way of stopping these foreigners from buying non-agricultural land.1. it i a question of squatters, these are people who are everywhere, and  especially at the Coast Province, and we cannot  direct which people to  buy the land. If a squatter wants to buy a piece of xl land, then, there is a willing a buyer, and a  willing seller,therefore,  always agree.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>(MRS.

SPEAKER: Mrs, Asiyo not here? Next Question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DDAIDDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Labour the following Question by Private Notice.(a)	Is he  aware that Abdi Tacho Mahad was employed as watchman by Robert Shaw MF 6 Limited from 1st May, 198 , to 31st  July, 1987?(b)	If so, why has he not been paid his rightful dues?  So that   Minister order? that Mr. Mahad be paid with  out   further delay?</Newspeech><Newspeech>The minister for labour (mr. okondo): mr speaker sir I beg reply s (a) I am aware that Mr. Abdi Tacho Mahad was employed watchman  to guard a house for the "managing director  Ms. Robert  Shaw Manufacturers Limited, between 3rdy January, 1987 1st May,  1987, as is stated in the Question  and31st July, 1987. However, my investigations have eke revealed that the employer did Not actually refuse to pay mr.mahad at all when this question came up I carefully looked into what had happened I approached  the employer and asked him to pay the money and he willingly offered to pay immediately the sum of kshs 3550.65 which Me.mahad may now collect any time from the labour offices.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DDATDDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while thanking my good friend, the bon. Minister for Labour, I would like to say that I have  not-,understood his reply. I am eaying so because sometimes we are told that. an employee should go to the Ministry of Labour  offices and collect his dues. Can the Minister now confirm to this House that if this gentleman goes to the labour office  today or tomorrow he will find the cheque here?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKOBDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I expect good will from both parties and, Ibelieve, hon. Ddaiddo has good will although he has not shown it in his supplementaryquestion. The fact is that when an employer has deposited money with the Ministry ofLabour, as soon as the cheque is cleared, the money becomes payable on identification.Sometimes what happens to workers is that when they arrive in the labour office theyare not able to identify themselves. Once they fail to prove that they are the rightclaimants, then obviously iten they cannot be paid. In those circumstances, whathappens   and it very often does   is that the worker runs back to his hon. Memberof Parliament and tells him lies that the money is not there. More often than not,before the hon. Member has checked anything, he runs to this House and says that therehas not been any  money in the labour office. Under such  circumstances, it isthe constituent or the worker who k is misleading the hon. Member ana telling himlies. Therefore, the hon. Member ought to go to the labour office and check the facts.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the sum of money I have mentioned, less KShs.822. forvarious things that the employee owed, will be available to him in a full account.The net money the employee should expect to get is XShs.2,723.50. So, please, letthe employee go and check before  the hon. Member can show ill-will that the money isnot there. Let him come to this House and say what has not been stated to me by my officers.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARAUBI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Labour the following Question by Private Notice.  (a)	Is the Minister aware that  Jabenga Constractors disappeared from a construction site in Meru Town in October; 1987  without paying his workers KShs.31,080/- and without paying Mr. Jusuf  Mucheke an amount of KShs.9,200/- arising from  transportation charges?	'(b)	Will the Minister assist the people involved to get their dues so that they may. have a happy X-Mass?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. Qkondo): Mr. Speaker} Sir, I beg to reply.(a) I am aware that this fira of contractors   Jabenga   were awarded a contract to build the Meru Municipal Bus Stage and,  in the process of doing so, they employed about 22 workers whom they paid weekly for the job. Come the 11th of November 1987,  a half of those employees complained to the Meru Labour Officer that they had not been paid for periods ranging two days to  13 days. They were given a letter by the labour officer to take to the employer GO that he could settle their claim, but this  did not happen. On 13th November, 1987 all the 22 employees who had been reported as being with the employer reported again  to the labour office claiming their terminal benefits. We had to investigate the matter, and we found out that the contractor  had left the site that same day when the complaint was launched. He had left because he had disagreed with his employers,  the"Meru Municipal Council. In the process of the disagreement, the municipal council had confiscated all the material and  equipment that the contractor had on site. Following that incident that was very unpleasant, the contractor abandoned the  site and ran away to Nairobi. As I am speaking this afternoon here, we have not yet managed to locate Jabenga Contractors.  So, if 3 anyone has an idea as to where they could be found, let him please do help us.Sir, we are also using the offices of the Meru Municipal Council to his help us trace these contractors, but they have not  been traced yet. 'However, I will continue to look for the contractor with a view to recovering the dues in respect of all  the former employees (b)	As regards the money the contractor owed Mr. Mucheke, I am sorry to inform the hon. Member, through the Chair, that I  am not able to help Mr. Mucheke in this  respect. This is-because I understand that Mr. Mucheke was not an employee of the  contractor but, rather, he was a sab-contractor on his own account for trans¬port purposes. He supplied transport services  and other materials to the main contractor. As such, I cannot intervene between a contractor and a sub-contractor because  there is no employment contract between them. what I can say is that the hon. Member should ask Mr. Mucheke to seek legal  advice to find remedy therein.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am just requesting s± whether the Minister could advise the Meru ME£EX Municipal Council to  sell the contractor's property that was confiscated in order to get money to pay these  workers.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKOKDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you know, under the Employment Act, the workers are not secured creditors. As a result,  whenever there, is a sale of equipment and materials under those circumstances, the secured  creditors have the first claim.  That is the law as it stands today and, therefore, I cannot guarantee this House that the Meru Municipal Council will be able  to pay the workers if and when they sell the materials and equipment that belong to the contractor.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

Mr Speaker, Sir.I beg to ask.the Minister for Labour the following Question by Private Notice.(a)	Is he aware that 42 people were employed as casuals in 1982 by IS/S East Kenya Bottlers, Machakos?(b)	Is he further aware that they were all sacked on 19th October, 1987 when they complained about their employment  terms?(c)	Could he order their reinstatement immediately?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mrv Okon&o): Mr. Speaker,Sir, I beg to reply although the hon Member was late. (a) I am indeed-: aware that Kenya Bottlers had employed 32 casuals way back in 1982, but not 42 as the hon." Member states   Since they were casual workers, they did not work continuously since that time(b)	I am aware that East Kenya Bottlers used to engage casuals from time to time 'depending on the amount of work at  hand,' On", the 19th October, 1987, this employer engaged the casuals as usual, but he declined to hire one of them called  Mra Malombe Mwangangi at the beginning of that day.' On hearing this - that Mwangangi was not going to be employed on that  day, the other casuals insisted that K-wangangi should be employed notwithstanding <> "When the management refused this  demand, the other casuals also refused to work, saying that they wouldnot do so without Mwangangi. They were therefore, dismissed since they were daily workers.(c)	In the usual way, a contract for a casual employee terminates at the end of each day, after he has been paid.: That-is the law today  As question of reinstatement of those casuals does not arise» However, each of them is quite free to  reapply and to submit himself for employment, when and if there is a job offered, and it is up to the employer to decide  whether or not he will take them for the .day:</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR MONYAO: Mr.~: Speaker, Sir, I totally shocked where the Minister has got his reply from- His office in Machakos has involved itself in this and they have called for the  record containing the names of these workers has been ascertained that the 42, not 32have been working on a continuousbasis because the kind of work they were doing was very technical and they could not be hired,  today and' not tomorrowWhere did the get records from?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR OEQTTDO: Mr, Speaker, Sir, we do our investigations,and we have got our ways of finding out the truth and this is	.What we have  established with those methods that we use.:</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR« MUNYAO: On a point of order, Mr.' Speaker, Sir. Through you, could we have the records with the Minister laid on the  Table? The records which have "been submitted by East Kenya bottlers to the Machakos Labour Office - the master-roll, the  pay-roll and others show that they were working on a  continuous basis. Will the Minister now lay on the Table the  copy of  the working-sheet of these members of staff since 1982?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKONDO: mr.; Speaker, Sir, even if the worker works every day and was paid every day since k 1S?2, as long as he was paid  on a daily basis, he remains a casual worker as the law stands today.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

In view of the fact that the Minister insists that his reply is  correct, would he therefore undertake - unfortunately this is our last day here  to lay those records on the Table to prove  that these people were casual workers? He knew that he was going to reply to t_his Question. Could he lay that information on  the Table so that we can see it? We cannot have our people being frustrated and the Minister comes here to defend the wrong  doers.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKONDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon.

As  has been stated, we are very concerned that after five years there is not very much  improvement in the running of this City, particularly in efficiency, cleanliness, water supply and in many other things which  should have been done by the Nairobi City Commission. This is a matter that \re take very seriously. This is . because the  only reason for removing elected councilors was that we thought the Commission  going to do a better job.	So, let us  seea better job, and not the same performance as before; otherwise we will have no reason for having requested that elected  councillors be removed.Mr. Speaker. Sir, when the Minister was moving this Bill he mentioned that he did not want some persons, or group of people,  to take control of the city, because Hairobi is the Canital City of Kenya and belongs to everybody. May I say that democracy  requires that forever  majority are, be allowed to control, or elect the people they Therefore there should be efficiency for  extending the tenure of the Nairobi City Commission. This is becauseirs-rreetrsec the insinuation in ii the Minister's  statement would mean that ho. raid that some group of electcd  councillors were going to take over the  City Council, and so that  what he is afraid of. If that was the motive, then one  would wonder as x to who are in this group. Who are in this group of people Who  are they  That is the statment that the Si Minister made  when he was moving this Bill. Are they the kikkuyu people because they are the majority in Nairobi or who are they? This is  the question to be asked. I hope it is not one of the reasons for having us extend the tenure of office of the Nairobi City  Commission. This is because that would be a very serious matter; it would be  tribaiistic and not in accordance with, the  best interests of this country. So, let the extension of the tenure of office of the Commission be purely for efficiency, and  let us see efficiency operating. If efficiency is ensured, we will support the Minister and the Commission. But we as not  want to see per iuaxion of the existing laxity in the operations of the cityWith these few remarks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>KEALIF Mr. Srseaier, S.ir, I stand to support the Bill because I really(done a good 2 job. I do not know what yardstick ire could use to measure the efficiency of this particular Commission, but  by my own standards, I know that the Commission 2 has done very well. This ik is because if one goes out in the City of  Nairobi. what the Commission has done is very evident. Some years ago, we could not drive in this city. because all the roads  were full of  potholes; some years ago the city  centre was fu filled un with filth. But we can now see that the Tairobi City  Commission has cleaned it up. I am not saying that it is perfect, or that they have done all what is expected of them, I am  saying is that they have  tried their best compared to what was there before.Mr. Speaker, Sir, those of us who have lived in this city for a long timeknow that during the days when the city was administered by the council, everything was done politically. Even wananchi were  not served, because their interests were allied to those of the councillors people were served according to what the  councillor at that time saw as their interests.So, what I am saying is that this particular Bill, which seeks to extend the life of the Cordission by some more year is  necessary I support it and hope that the Commission will use that extended tenure of office  because it is free from politics  and divisive influences  to serve the people in the city,  AS has beensaid, Nairobi is an important city. We have a lot of world organizations based here;it is one of the ir.ost busy cities in terns cf international affairs. We have a lotof visitors coming in here. Also, wananchi themselves need a lot of services to berendered. If you go t places like Eastleigh and come other villages outsidethe city, you will find that the City Commission has not done as it isrequired to. There is still a lot of filth. They are still concentrating on constructing the well-to-do parts of the city,  which is not fair. Mr. Speaker, Sir, wananchi, irrespective of their wealth, or how much they own, are equal in the eyes of the law, and they  have to be served equally by the City Commission. The City Commission is there for all wananchi, and not only the high-class  people, or the people who live in Lavington areas and the City centres. The City is there for the Mathare people, Eastleigh  people, and everyone else. There is 110 reason why one should wake up in the morning, say, in Eastleight and find a lot of  filth in front of his house which has not been collected for the last three weeks. This is garbage.Mr. Speaker, Sir, what I would like to urge the Minister is to see that there is fair play in the way service is given so  that every  mwananchi and all parts of the City are properly served by the City Commission. With those few remarks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to support theBill.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NYOIKE: Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.In this last stage of this Bill, I only have one or two commentt to make. First of all, let me express my very sincere hope -  ray very deeply felt hope  that this will be the last time that the Minister for Local Government will come into this House  and request that there be extension of tenure for the Nairobi City Commission. It is my pray< it is my wish, and it is hope  that this will be the last time.When we discussed this matter for the first time, and it wasclear.to everybody that the City Council of Nairobi was not doingwhat it was meant to do, we gave the City Commission a' chance whichhas been renewed and we are going to renew it again.Mr. Speaker, Sir, this reminds me of a saying by a famous African politician by the name Dr. Namdi   Azikiwe who was the  first President of Nigeria, He told the British Government-at the time of Independence that if after 100 years of tutoring  Nigerians have notlearned to.manage themselves, then surely there must be somethingwrong with, the teacher. Now, if after five years the City Commissionhas not been able to put the Nairobi affairs in the proper footing,then surely there must be something, wrong with the City' Commission.Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is my sincere hope that the Minister andthe Government will not take these shortcuts whenver we have problems with the City councillors. And there will be problems with many county councils and Local Authorities of all kinds because,  these problems reflect the nature of our societies. For instance, there is corruption, tribalism, .inefficiency,  "brotherisation", and there is all manner of evil .in our society. There is all manner of evil in the Central Government as  well as in the Local Authorities. This is the problem- of our time. This is the problem where we have to "grab a whip as  leaders. This .is what His Excellency the President all the  time keeps on talking about against tribalism. It is the problem  of our  and there is no shortcut to it. We just have  to come to it and deal with it.Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is always the temptation to take ashortcut and to do the easier things. When the Nairobi City Council is not very efficient, we slam a commission there; when  the Mombasa Municipal Council is. not doing very well, we slam another commission there. That is not the solution. The  solution is that the Minister for Local Government' who has a lot of powers because, in fact, rightnow under the Act, the Minister has extensive powers   he can: stop any Local Authority from spending money. Me can also  refuse to approvetheir appointments. The Minister lias now got the powers to interfere with any action they do. He does not need the  Commission. Hecan actually guide these people.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would request the hon. Minister, instead of taking these shortcuts towards the commissions, let him do  his workof guiding "these Local Authorities towards maturity  as we also guide ourselves towards maturity. We have a problem and this  problem is not only in Nairobi. City alone but it is a national problemMr. Speaker, Sir, the last point that I would like to make here is that I am normally very, very worried when I hear of  commissions because the problem in the Continent of Africa today is that democracy has not been allowed to work in very many  countries. I have read the explanations usually given by the military regimes when they dislodge elected Governments. They  always say that these  people, are inefficient, .corrupt, tribalists, and so on. They usually read the whole long list of the  "evils" of their societies as they go ahead and overthrow the elected Government and put a General there in charge. Then the  same corruption continues and usually becomes worse.Mr. Speaker, Sir, to these Generals, we will tell them that we understand that politicians are weak. We also, understand that  elected Governments are not perfect, but the solution is not military dictator¬ships It is a question of national will to  struggle on the part of leaders to improve themselves.Mr. Speaker, Sir, these  shortcuts that Africans have found which makes us have over 56 per cent of the African Governments  as Governments have not helped the Continent. On the contrary, they have taken us back. I would like the Minister for Local  Government to consider that. We do not  shortcuts. One can always have an excuse to sabotage elections or democracy. One can  always say that these people are not capable. This is what the  colonialists-told us for many years.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES (Mr. Na sir) ; Jambo la nidhamu, Dw. Spika.

NYOIKE: Mr. Speaker , Sir, I think the problem is that the hon. Member did not understand me and I will speak to him  after the adjournment of the House!Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is my honest view that we shall teach our  people to be proper. We shall make sure under  the powers  that we have given to the Minister for Local Government that all Local Authorities in Kenya will move towards the path of  nationalism, patriotism, efficiency, and so on, just as we have to learn to do the same ourselves. But we should be very  careful whenever the Minister has to come and say that Such-and Such a Local Authority is not doing very well. Therefore, I  want to install a commission there". There is no shortcut to democracy.With those few remarks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUNYAO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, at this stage of the Bill, there is nothing we can do  than to congratulate the Minister, and  perhaps to say one or two points0.orrttreMr. Speaker, Sir, this Bill concerns the Nairobi City Commission and Nairobi is the capital of Kenya. It is also perhaps the  centre of Africa because it is the best City and people like it. We have a number of Commissioners, and I remember there was  either a Motion or a Question here requiring the Minister to zone out the Commissioners so that within the period they would   be there, they would be manning some areas so that when they go back to the Commission or Board, they can report what they  have seen in other areas. This is very important because if it is not done some areas will be left even without any services  at all.Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is very true that the country has hadvery little rains. In fact, Nairobi estates or some parts of Nairobi are not receiving; adequate water. Perhaps if the  Commissioners are not zoned out in this way, they will not know which areas are not receiving water and so on. We feel that  at this time when we have the Commission and the Commissioners, it is up to them to bring a proper report to the Commission.'"Mr. Speaker, Sir, the idea of extending Commission may not be very interesting or good This idea of having commissions  might even extend to constituencies.Mr. Speaker, Sir, what would the Minister feel if his constituency were to be run by a commission? I am sure he would not be very happy to have his constituency run by a commission. It is okay if some councillors make one or two errors because to err is human. We are expected to make a mistake here and there. The Minister should look into the possibility of reducing the tenure of office for commissioners to at least three or six months. What would a commission be required to sort out for more than three, four or five years like the Nairobi City Commission other than providing poor services and so on?An example of a service which has been poorly provided by the Commission and which many hon. Member talked about during the Second Reading of the Bill is garbage collection. This service has gone down completely. This has forced many Nairobi residents to dig holes to pat rubbish. Since these holes, get filled up so often, the residents have resorted to burning rubbish every evening and hence causing fires which we might not find a cure for. Fires are erupting in every area. I expect that when the Minister comes to reply, he will consider some of these facts and narrow some of these issues.Finally, Sir, I would like to make a simple request to the Minister,with regard to areas where new construction of houses and so on are coming up. Roads should be considered beforehand in those areas. An example of such an area is Langata Road. There are so many buildings which are being put up along that road and yet nothing is being done about that road. That road is so narrow. It has been suggested several times in this House that that road is going should be made a dual carriage way but it seems that the Minister for Local Government does not have any immediate plans in that respect. Due to traffic congestion, one needs to start travelling from Langata at 5.00 a.m. in order to be in the office at 8.00 a.m. I was just givingLangata Road as an example but I am sure every road leading to Nairobi has that congestion, we are happy, Sir, because some of the roads have dual carriageways.The maintenance of roads in Industrial Area which is a granary of this country is very poor. Potholes in that area axe incredible.With those few words, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR WATER DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Mwendwa): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. As I believe that we have discussed this matter to exhaustion, I would like to suggest that the Mover be now called upon to reply.</Newspeech>(Question that the Mover be now called upon to reply put and agreed to)<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. Mudavadi): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the hon. Members of this House for the contributions they have made in connection with this Bill. With regard to the division of tribes and as hon. Wamae said that I might have had other motives by bringing this Bill to the House, I would like to say that I had not other motive.I would, therefore, take this opportunity to wish my hon. colleagues a merry Christmas and a prosperous new year.I beg to move.</Newspeech>(Question put and agreed to)						    (The Bill was accordingly read the Third Time and passed)<Header>MINISTERIAL STATEMENT</Header><Newspeech>THE MINISTER OF STATE, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. ole Tipis): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. With the kind permission of this august House, I rise to briefly respond to a personal statement made by hon. Shikuku on 9th December, 1987. His statement was in response to mine made earlier in connection with the Butero Constituency Self Help Develop¬ment Fund. Whereas I do not wish to make this issue appear as though weare engaged, in a wish to make this issue a sort of truth telling contest with ray hon. colleague, I am, however, compelled to react to his remarks for I believe that the truth has to be told.On the outset, I would like to reiterate ray earlier remarks that the freedom of association or any freedom has limits. Even the Kenya Constitution which we take lead from, is very explicit. The enjoyment of freedom should not infringe on others. It is not true, Sir, that the people of Butere have been denied association as many Harambee meetings have recently been held in that constituency. The hon. Member has been bent on to equate this opportunities to deliver political lectures to his constituents. I have the latest copies of applications for permits to convene public meetings which I will lay on the Table. All of them bear his favourite agenda, namely; current political affairs and development in Butere Constituency.Kenyans have come of age and have no time or need for political lectures. As such, the Kakamega District Security Committee has denied the hon. Member such licences. The Kanu Chairman, Kakamsga, as is the practice in the entire country, has no hand in such matters of licencing public meetings. 	Mr. Speaker, Sir, with regard to the money that was not accounted for by civil servants, I did promise this House that those involved would either have to make good the loss or face the music. The information I have just received indicate that most of this money if not all has been repaid. The amount involved was Kshs. 80,224/- Along with the above amount, the hon. Member has colorfully avoided to mention in this House that when the Fund actively started collecting money way back in 1980/81 the money collected was banked by the then Butere District Officer, Mrs. Wanabiro. At some stage hon. Shikuku did demand that the money this lady had banked should be withdrawn and handed over to him. Given his position at that time she obliged. The hon. Member has since vehemently e denied having received that amount.However, Sir, because this h money had to be made good just like allunaccounted for monies, the lady district officer who has since left the civilservice has been compelled to sell her private property to make good this money.To this day, hon. Shikuku has continued to deny having received any money andwe are left hoping that only posterity will tell as to whom between hon. Shikuku and the lady district officer told the truth. The amount involved was Kshs. 50,395/-.Again in 1980 as stated in the Audit Report page 2, it was resolved inter alia that all monies collected in respect of this fund should be re-deposited with the Kenya Commercial Bank, Mumias branch. It is amazing hos up to this day hon. Shikuku and his henchmen are still operating the funds' accounts in Nairobi. Hon. Shikuku, Mr. Richard 0. Mukabi and Mr. Wilfred Dickson Ochieng are operating joint savings and fixed accounts in the Bank of Oman. The hon. Member did tell this House on 9/l2/87	and several other timesprior to that that according to Butere Constituency Self Help Development Fund constitution, the The District Officer for Butere should be the treasurer. However, the truth of the matter is that the district officer is not a signatory to this Nairobi Account, The question that comes up to mind is that "In what capacity are the two gentlemen operating these accounts"?Sir, hon, Shikuku has insisted that keeping proper accounts of theFund is the business of the treasurer who in this case is the DistrictOfficer, From Butere. From the same Audit Report he has been fond of flagging in this House, it is stated on page 2 that the Fund receipt books were issued to Chiefs and Assistant Chiefs directly by the Chairman, hon. J.M. Shikuku. The same Report adds that even the 285 receipt books that were audited were collected from his house.Hon. Shikuku seems to be a mysterious man, A glance at the transactions carried out in the Bank of Oman Accounts casts a lot of doubts upon his honesty and integrity. The samples of authenticated documents I have here clearly prove that hon. Shikuku and his henchmen have been involved in the transactions of this public funds at this Bank and no civil servant, including the so-called 'Treasurer' of the Fond has been involved. For instance, hon,. Shikuku, Mr. Wilfred Dickson Ochieng and Mr, Richard 0. Mukabi issued a cheque No. 194829 of Kshs. 3,000/- dated 13/5/86 to Bunyore Girls High School. Also, the same signatories issued a cheque No. 202485 of Kshs, 4,475/- dated 6/7/87 to Chavakali High School. For what purpose and under what mandates, the signatures of those who issued those cheques Eire not on record. Why I term hon. Shikuku mysterious is that he expects the 'Tresurer' to keep proper accounts of funds some of which he has not been party to the withdrawals and for unkown expenditures.Sir, the documents tabled in this House on 9/12/87 have even more telling revelations. For example, on 13/7/84, the Savings Account had a balance of Kshs. 213,627/85 and on 5/11/84, the Account had a balance of only Kshs. 4,537/85 meaning.that hon. Shikuku and his "brothers" had withdrawn Kshs. 210,000/- from the Account. By 19/2/87, four months later a total of Kshs. 160,000/- was recredited to the Account. There has been several withdrawals in between, sometimes four times a month.The balance to-date stands at only kshs.13,237/-Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to implore upon my hon. colleague and friend to sober up and desist from portraying a holier than thou attitude in this House. He is far from it. In my last statement I observed that he was not clean in this matter, and he almost blew up the roof of this House. This time he might even commit "hara kiri"- to use my colleague's terminology.I want to repeat again that he is not clean, and e if anything, he is the biggest culprit of this otherwise noble idea. He has abused a noble intention and he should be ashamed of.I note he has committed a total of kshs 133,802.50 into a, fixed deposit to mature on the 30th January, 1988. I may also mention that he was continuously depositing various amounts on the a same account over the years, without any mandate and therefore, continued to reap the interest accruing there from selfishlyI would expect the hon. Member who has been in this House that long not to forget that, as he claims to be “the people's  watchman" to know that unauthorised expenditure of public funds is illegal and a serious criminal offence. It is a shame thathe himself, has abused and brought through disrepute to a fund that can be rightly described as his own brain child. He has hurled all kinds of abuses at civils servants; intimidated chiefs and assistant chiefs in Butere about this fund. We are now led to conclude that his loud mouthed utterences on this issue was calculated to cause confusion not only to this House, but even more to the very people it was intended to benefit. Nothing short of a clear expenditure account by hon. Shikuku will restore his integrity and clear this fund from the present state of disrepute. I once again appeal to my hon. friend to do so.Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have nothing to hide, we have authenticated documents here which I leave to the House to judge for themselves. He himself was a signatory and he should therefore, not try to accuse other people who in a way or the other were not really involved in this Nairobi Oman Bank Account. The documents are here, authenticated by the bankers themselves, and I hope that will clear the air for the good of the country andfor his own sake.Thank you very much Mr. Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I wish to stand again and answer my hon. friend some few points here.	First of all, with regards to the question of freedom of associationhe says that I give political lectures. I do not know under what law this is forbidden. He did not want to say where it is forbidden to speak politics or anything else. Maybe heis making that law himself or it is from somewhere outside this House, I leave that to the people to decide. We have got the freedom to talk about anything not only one development. We do not, therefore, get threatened by what  the Minister has said, I am allowed to say anything.Secondly, I am again grateful that he has admitted that all this money, kshs.80,224/- was eaten by the chief and the assistant chiefs. The interesting part of it, however is about Mrs. Wanambiru, the District Officer of Butere who was the first ever treasurer of this fund. He has said that shewithdrew money and gave it to me. That is not true because Mrs, Wanabmiru is a graduate, she could not have given me money and then not signed for it. She ate the money, and I gave a statement to that effect in 1986. Up to today I have heard nothing concerning it. I am glad that the Ministersaid that she has refunded the money. How can she refund what she never took?He has said something concerning the operating of the fund in Nairobi. I said that we operate two accounts. We started operating the Fund with the Kakamega branch of Kenya Commercial Bank, then opened another one at Mumias, moved on to Nairobi Barclays Bank and finally shifted to Bank of Oman. The Bank of Oman in Nairobi operates a branch of the accounts which is operated in Butere. They have decided to aid the poor students who cannot afford paying school fees in form one. They are withdrawing all this s money that he is talking about. It is withdrawn and paid to the schools. He has even talked about these receipts numbers. All the money has been paid to the respective schools. The children whose fees have been paid know it. I do not know why the Minister does not want us to do that.He has talked about kshs.213,000 about the fund coming down. After paying school fees for these children, naturally the balance cannot remain static. For those of us who know accounts this is the case. The accounts the Minister is talking about may be from somewhere else. It has been shown in the statements here how the money was withdrawn. It was used to pay school fees to various schools for poor children who scored high marks in their Kenya Certificate of Education Examination. There is no question about that.The only thing I, can say is that hon. Shikuku cannot be so unintelligent. If I have 'eaten’ the money of if I was involved or if I am not clean, surely I should not insist that this fund should be probed. I would be a fool to do so because I know that they would trace me. I am not that type of a fool.What I am saying is that and it is of no use for one to stand here just to look big if the Minister feels that he is right then let him send this matter to court. He has all the law at his disposal. We cannot go on arguing with the Minister all the times. If, indeed, he is serious let him go to court to prove or show how every cent was used. If I am found guilty,I am not above the law. I am fed up. The Minister is hell bent in defending the people who have eaten the Butere people's money_, hoping that I can sit down when he accuses me falsely of having taken the money. I want him, to prove that, I challenge him. Let him also go to court and say what he is saying here and prove it. That will be the best thing. I do not want anybody else other than the Minister to go to court. I would like him to do that and I will face him in a court of law.The Minister says that I am not clean. If I am not clean, it is very interesting. I am clean, and I will remain clean. I do not know in which court the Minister was and found me unclean. I am not here to be judged by the Minister. Let us face each other in a court of law, and we shall find out who knows accounts; who is clean and who is not clean.On the question of the illegal expenditure, the Nairobi branch of the Butere Constituency Self Help Development fund authorized that the money in Nairobi be used, for the payment of school fees of those brilliant boys and girls from Butere. I challenge him; let him not threaten us with his authority or with taking legal action against us; let us go and fight it out in a court of law.The Minister also talked of my having a loud mouth and confusing people. I do not want to confuse anybody; I shall fight for the truth. The truth is that people's money was 'eaten' by civil servants. The Nairobi branch of the Fund was not being operated by the district officer. The main account in Butere is the one which has millions of shillings and not the Nairobi one. The Nairobi branch of the fund does not even have Sh.400,000/-. The Nairobi branch of the Fund has the right, according to the constitution, to use that money to pay for the school fees of the s poor students. That is what is happeningLet me finish by talking about the issue of receipt books. The receipt books were given to the district officer, and whenever the assistant chiefs finished the receipt books they would go back to the district officer tobe issued with new ones. The assistant chiefs brought the money and it was banked.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have given the Minister a challenge.We should no longer talk about this issue in this Parliament.We shall find out who is what when we k meet in a court of law.Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER OF STATE, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr.ole Tipis): Mr. Speaker, it is not really my intention to enter into very unnecessary arguments with my hon. friend. I have said in very clear terms that, the so called freedom of association is there for the good of this nation, but if somebody wants to use that political platform to gimmick this country,then the Government will not tolerate that nonsense.What I am getting at is that the hon. Member must come out clean. He was the printer of these receipt books. He has not accounted for the 285 receipt books which he, himself, distributed – not to the chiefs or the assistant chiefs. The Butere Constituency self help Development Fund was set up with the under¬standing that the money collected would be deposited at the Mumias branch of the Kenya Commercial Bank. The hon. Member had the audacity of going round the comer and depositing the money in the Bank of .Oman with his two henchmen who are the signatories. The district commissioner Kakamega was not a signatory to that Fund, and now the hon. Member claims, and keeps on insisting that the district commissioner was responsible as the treasurer. How could he .have been a treasurer?Mr. Speaker, Sir, if it comes to matters of accountancy, I think I am more conversant with accounts than the hon. Member. I studied accountancy up to advanced level before I joined politics, and anybody can check my records on this one. So, he is only a mere layman as far as accounts concerned. There is no argument about that.Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a record of the transactions concerning this money. If he wants to place the blame of the misappropriation of this money on the treasurer, was then treasurer a signatory to the cheques which I am laying on the Table, for the amount of Sh.213,000/- which they have withdrawn? It is hon. Shikuku who is to blame. The papers I am going to lay on the Table S. or everybody to see, are authenticated; theyare not the kind of papers the hon. Member collects from here and there. These papers have been authenticated by the bank manager who states categorically that the money was with¬drawn with hon. Shikuku’s authority; he was a signatory to the account, and to try and blame other people who never had any¬thing to do with the account is very mean and districting, if I may use the word. The papers are here ii for anybody to see, and I would hate that rascal to shout at me as if I were rubbish.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The person who is calling me a rascal is the biggest old rascal.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER POR STATE, OFFICE OP THE PRESIDENT (Mr. ole Tipis): Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you allow us to continue like this, you can now see who the rascal is.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER POR INDUSTRY (Mr. Ouko): On a point of order, Sir. Speaker, Sir. On account of what is going on, may I ask Mr. Speaker to assist us in restoring the dignity of this House?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER OP STATS, OPPICE OP THE PRESIDENT (Mr. ole Tipis): As I said, the hon. Member is not clean, and I repeat he is not clean. He is going to be involved in accounting for the use or misuse of this public fund. This is what he he is aching for. He is trying to cover up with his holier thanthou attitude. Why does he not wait for the investigators to comeout with their findings? Anybody found having Misappropriated thismoney will, definitely, face the consequences. I am not, as my hon. friend knows, bent on defending a wrong doer. He knows that very well, and that is why he is scared of me. I will defend the right, up to my grave, and I do not fight unnecessarily. He should not blame other people by trying to get out of itscot free. This we shall not allow, In fact we have information which I do not want todivulge in this House because it goes deeper than this. As	far 'money-eating’	 is concerned, he is one of the biggest'money-eatenrs" as far is this Butere Constituency Self-help Department Fundis concerned. The receipt books were not being distributedentirely by chiefs. He has 285 receipt books which he has notaccounted for. Where the money collected through these receipt books is questionable, and that is why he is cunning enough to divert the money to Nairobjy instead of having it banked into the Mumias branch of the Kenya Commercial Bank.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: Who is questioning that?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE MINISTER OF STATE, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. ole Tipis): There is no matter of questioning, you can question your devil.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: However strongly an hon. Member feels that something has been said about him, the proper cure to it is not to hit back with abusive terms, but to show that the person concerned has said the wrong thing; point it out and try to see that it is not done again. We do not want collision here where hon. Members make remarks that are unnecessarily dirty. So, I hope that we will avoid this. If hon. Shikuku heard hon. ole Tipis say something which was improper, he could have helped the situation otherwise, instead of hitting back. I appeal to the House to behave with dignity as hon. Dr. Ouko said. Next Order.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: Which order? which order?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: It is not yet 4.30 p.m. yet.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER:	 The Order Paper says that the Motion for the Adjournment will be moved not later than 4.30 p.m., and this means that it can be moved now. (Mr. Shikuku stood in his place)Order, Mr.Shikuku. You spoke on this Motion the other day, so I do not know .what the idea of your standing up now is.</Newspeech><Header>MOTION FOR THE ADJOURNMENT</Header> Sine Die Adjournment of the House <Newspeech>THE VICE PRESIDENT AND MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. Kibaki): Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for pointing out the order of things here. I beg to move :-THAT this House do now adjourn Sine Die. It is true that we had a very brief sine die adjournment of the House recently, but I believe that, this adjournment will be in the normal order of sine dieI wish every hon. Member a merry Christmas and a prosperous new year. I think hon. Members also wish me a prosperous, new year, and I am very grateful for this.I would like to encourage hon. Members to go on with Kanu membership recruitment while at home because we have not stopped this exercise; we onlyconcluded the registration of voters. While we continue to recruit Kanu members, we should maintain the Kanu discipline of mutual respect among hon.Members, Above all, we should be friendly with one anotherIt is very important that in difficult times hon. Members of thisHouse give a lead in political matters. What I am saying is that you and I,who read newspapers, keep seeing statements by hon. Members and other leadersdeclaring other leaders to be anti-Nayo You know that we have one party,one leader and one country. We are united in our own Philosophy of Nyayo.The language of calling others anti-Nyayo people, in the context of normalpolitical competition ought to be banned. This particular phrase should be left to people who are treasonable, such as, "Mwakenya" and others. If an ordinary leader or politician goes on saying, "So and so is anti-Nyayo" merely because he does not like someone, he is creating unnecessary confusion and a sense of divisionism which has no basis whatsoever. It is much better that in a one-party system, people talk about real things and real persons. I have said this before, but I am sure it can bear repetition.Perhaps, more important is the fact that these days the Nyayo Philosophy is, as you know, identified with the Head of this nation, who is also the Head of the Party and the Government Nobody should use it lightly. We should use this phrasiology with a sense of respect towards the originator of this philosophy, the President, who is the Head of State.In any case, in this season of goodwill, that is Christmas, we should as Christians or good Muslims, remember that it is simple to bear false witness against others. Even if they happen to be our political enemies or competitors, we should not bear false witness against them0 In any case, the politics of this nation cannot stand any leader who wants to be taken seriously bearing false witness against others.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: Hear! Hear!</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE VICE PRESIDENT AND MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. Kibaki): Mr. Speaker, Sir, what I am saying has nothing to do with what the hon. Memberfor Butere is shouting about. I am not really commenting on any Butere matter; I am talking about Kenya, and I do not want to be misunderstood.In Kenya, we, the leaders, are elected to lead and we must always speak the truth, and not bear false witness against one another or against any other person because that is a very grievous sin. If anyone dies bearing that kind of sin, he will go straight to Hell, and that is very serious. We do not want any .Kenyans to go to Hell; we would like them to be in Heaven so that we may continue to be together as Kenyans.Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I may add this point, it is very gratifying to see the way Kenyans have shown their solidarity in the recent week when a few misguided elements in our neighbouring country, Uganda, attempted their own adventures near the border. We are grateful that the police and other security forces disciplined them. (Applause)We are grateful that those people were shown that such attempts will always be met with a similar reaction. That is how Kenyans are. Although we never boast of this fact, we are efficient in doing what we want to do. I think that of all people, Ugandans should know that we are capable of doing what we want to do and that they should not attempt to annoy us because we will do what we want to do to them.I know that this Parliament has been fairly productive in the short sitting during which we have been here, So, I want to thank every hon. Member for the tolerance they have shown after we had to call them back here in a hurry. Their tolerance has been evident in the way they have been attending sessions here in large numbers.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Biwott): Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity and for restoring the dignity of this House. Without you, to keep this House in order, we will at times tempted to drift from the level of dignity that we require here.It is very important that hon. Members remember that they are hon. Members. Members of Parliament are elected in their constituencies by large numbers of people because they are considered to be honourable enough to come to this House to look after the welfare of thousands of the people who elect them and collectively look after the welfare of the entire nation. So, there should never be any room for lack of discipline among hon. Members.Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have been advised many times in this House after the Third Reading of the Bill we have just passed that we should not give the impression that the Front Bench is not as interested in the welfare of wananchi as the Back Bench. Indeed, I think that the Front Bench is as involved and interested in the welfare of the nation as is the Back Bench.So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our colleagues in the Back Bench should not misunderstandus nor should they misinterprets our intentions because they are good intentionsand any Bill that we bring to this House is for the good of this nation. I amsaying this because we want this nation to be better off each time we bring aBill in this House.Mr. Speaker, Sir? another area on which we need to concentrate ourefforts is the area of education; education about the law; and education about everything: else.. We should know what the law says. We should educate our people about the Constitution and how to be good citizens so that whatever we do will stand good judgement in of the eyes of wanachi. I am saying this because the truth will remain the truth and what is right will remain right and vie should always aspire to do the right thing. In fact, I would like to borrow the words that the Vice President and Minister for Home a Affairs used the other day, that in this country, we are lucky to have a leader "who never tells lies. Under the same token, we would like to have hon. Members of Parliament who never tell lies. We would like to have hon. Members of Parliament who will always provide good leadership in this country so that we can have people who tell the truth; people who can sit here and pass laws so that our country can become the most democratic country in the world.Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have been very active since the time we were recalled,We have demonstrated to the world that we are united and that we mean to defend ournation and that we know what exactly what is good for our country, and what it takesto protect our Constitution and cur several institutions. So, any neighbouringcountry, or anybody for that matter, should not even contemplate to play about withKenya. The question of refugees has been going on for many years and at times ourintegrity is in question regarding the issue of human rights. Where is a country that	has shown more human consideration than ourselves? How many refugees have been after in this oountiy? Ugandans know very well that Kenya has been a traditionalrefuse for them and each time they throw out the lot, they come to Kenya andwhen their time cones for going back; they go back to their country and others alsocome in. The latest person to come here and go back home is Museveni, himself. was here and he knows very wall that when he was here, he never saw us trainingpeople from outside this Country. If we were training such people here, we wouldhave trained him. So, he should not mislead his country because Kenya has atno time indulged in interfering with, the internal affairs of any neighbouring country.The resolve that Kenyans have demostrated the ceagerness of our people to deal adevastating blow to those who are playing about with us, is so clear now that wehope we shall not have any more of this.Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will be going for Christmas and I hope that hon.Members will use the Christmas time for rededication and service to wananchi, so thatthey can be useful to them during the Kanu recruitment drive. I hope they will beable to explain the election procedures to wananchi and to assist their districtdevelopment committeess by explaining to them about the District Focus for RuralDevelopment Strategy. Above all, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hope that hon. Members willensure that our people are well protected.With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech>(Question proposed)<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Kisiero): Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to support this Motion. It is true, as His Excellency the Vice President and Minister for Home Affairs has & said, that we are now going for Christmas and this is a time for joy and peace. Unfortunately, those of us who come from Western Province, particularly Bungoma and Busia Districts, are not going to enjoy their Christmas the way we have always enjoyed in the past This is because our friends from Uganda have found it necessary to interfere with our peace. Kenyans have always enjoyed their Christmas and they love peace and they are not used to the kind of life that has existed in Uganda for the last 20 as or 24 years. Kenyans, are not used to running away guns, nor are they used to living under fear and terror. Therefore, what the Museveni Government is trying to do at the border is extremely unfortunate and we Kenyans, particularly at the border, hope that thia kind of provocation will stop as soon as possible.Mr. Speaker, Sir, we in Mr. Elgon have been very friendly to our neighboursin Uganda and our local folks have been giving them sugar, cigarettes, bread and so on, in the spirit of Nyayo philosophy of love. However, it .is unfortunate that these sax same soldiers have now been turned against us.As a matter of fact, before they did what they did a few days ago, that is, trying to kill our people, they have b8en stealing our cattle for the last one year. For tea last one year; Sir, we have lost thousands s of cattle from Mt. Elgon area which, have been stolon by the National Resistance Army soldiers to feed themselves We are extremely tired about this behaviour because as most of us  know, a Kalenjin is very fond of his cows and this is the only asset that he knows. However, because of the territorial respect, we have not been going across the bonter to bring a back our cows. If this attitude does not stop, we shall certainly go and get our cows back because we have lost too many of them to ungrateful people.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the people of Mt. Elgon and in Chepkube arid. Cheptai in particular whom I visisted at the weekend, are very grateful to His	Excellency the President for sending the police, game rangers and forest guards to protect them.They are doing a good job and are in very high spirit they people have asked me to convey their gratitude to His Excellency the President for looking after them so well. They have told me to assure him that they will give him total support to the end.Mr. Speaker, Sir, our friend desire to disturb us at the border has notstopped. I am saying this because those s of us near the border can see that Mr.Museveni is actually preparing to hit us since he is preparing a huge army,for reasons I cannot tell. However, one can easily surmise that he is preparing todisturb this country and9 the re fore, we should not go back, to sleep and think that he is going to leave us alone. Therefore, we have to be 333332 prepared and ensure that if he does not stop his dirty designs, we are able to defend our peace which we have enjoyed for a long time.Mr. Speaker, Sir, what we have seen across the border is that some of these soldiers do not want to a fight us but are just being pushed to fight us and I think this is why Museveni is turning to foreigners to assist him. He must have realized that these soldiers know very well that Kenyans have been friendly and kind to them and they know that if they fight us, this will be a senseless and dirty war; a war that is bound to fail.With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. arap NG’ENY: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for a giving me this opportunity so that I can join the .hon. Members of this House in support of this Motion.First of all, I would like to join the previous hon. Member who have already contributed to the Motion inwishing all the Members of Parliament a merry Christmas, and a prosperous new year of 1958.</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN. HON. MEMBER: Thank you.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. arap NG'ENY: I hope that all the hon. Members will enjoy their Christmas after such a busy and long Session.Secondly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank all the hon. Members for the co-operation that they have shown to the Chair .in the Course of this Session which has been verybusy. A lot of work has been transacted, and thisowas enabled by the co-operation of all the hon. Members of this House. I would also like to restate a fact that we have a occasionaly forgotten. Sir, Kenya is a democratic country, and His Excellency the President has spared no time in reminding us that this Parliament is a very important institution. His Excelleny the President himself has faith in this House because he has got faith in the people of this country. He would like the people to continueexercising their democractic rights in electing the Parliamentaryrepresentives that they like. It is for this reason that wewho have the privilege be of being in this House, should ensurethat we live up to those expectations, in what we do, what	'we say and in how we go about our business in enhancing the democraticand the stable nature of our country.Mr. Speaker, Sir, because our country is democratic, it is not dictatorial, it is not aristocratic, and it is nottheocratic. Therefore, I would like to say that we have toeliminate from our midst a new development that is emerging,because it would be very dangerous for our democratic Government.It was only recently when we completed the exercise of registeringvoters. Registration of voters means only one thing, that when the elections will be called, it will be the ordinaryregistered Kenyan who will elect the people who will come to this august House. There is no other machinery which will beused. I must express some concern and we have heard throughthe Press occasionally ever certain tendencies in this country that will endanger democracy. We cannot afford to have the so called power in this country. I am no quaere with the Press if they want to make money by calling us names and other things. But it is m important that the voter in this country is enabled to make a choice of whom to represent him in this House.Mr. Speaker, Sir, to me these people who parading around are machiavellian and you know very well the tactics  which were advocated by Ma Machiavelli we cannot affordto have machiavellians in this country. We want people who are responsible, land people who are capable of facing the wananchi, so that they are elected or deteated and acceptwhatever verdict honourably.Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on behalf of my Constituents of I would like to appeal Aldai to the Ministry of Transport and Communicationsto give us a  small token so that road B291 can be tarmacked. This road crosses the eastern part of my Aldai Constituency. This area happens to be a very fertile area with plenty of rainfall, and we grow very many crops such as tea, coffee sugar cane and all types of vegetables. During the rainy season it becomes very difficult to transport as some of these commodities.Mr. Speaker, Sir, with those few remarks, I beg to support the Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENERGY AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Mwicigi): Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to join my hon. colleagues in supporting this Motion.Sir, we have been working here very hard and we have done a very good job,something we much congratulate ourselves for. After all that work, we need a rest.At least, we need time to go back to our constituencies during the Christmas and NewYear festivities and attend to other duties. It is equally important for Ministersto get time off to see what is going on in the country and attend to some of the very pressing issues. I would like to cite an example of the problems that coffee farmers are facing because I come from a coffee growing community. Our small scale farmers are in a lot of problems because they are not being paid although they need their 'money badly. Christmas is with us now and those farmers need their money. After that, they will be required to pay school fees for their children in January and they do not have the money to do so. So, something must be done by the Ministry of Co-operative Development to ensure that coffee farmers are paid because they need that money. Our coffee farmers work very hard to have some income that they can use at the proper time, and this is the proper time to give them their money. It is very important to support coffee farmers because they are the major earners of foreign exchange in this country. We get a lot of money coming into this country because of coffee sales. Therefore, coffee is like the goose that lays the golden egg and needs a lot of Kenya. Coffee helps this nation, families and individuals alike. So, whena coffee farmer has some problems, those problems should be looked into immediately, A short delay in looking s into such problems could be fatal because, at the end of the day, a lot of farmers may not be paid.Mr. Speaker, Sir, despite the fact that we see in the Press that so muchmoney has been given to Murang’a District, for example, to pay farmers, when it comesto what the actual farmer is supposed to be paid, the whole thing reads nil. Thereare so many deductions from coffee earnings such that when you go to be paid, you aretold to go back and continue farming until another season when, perhaps, youmay be paid something for your coffee. Coffee farmers are suffering and we should support them./Mr, Speaker left the Chair/ /Mr. Deputy Speaker took the Chair/Deputy	Mr. Speakers Sir, during this time tea in Murang'a District is being plucke but the roads are completely worn out such that even a four wheel drive vehicle is no able' to transport tea leaves to the factory. This is so, despite the fact that tea is the second biggest earner of foreign exchange in this country. Where, there is a lot of wealth, let us not destroy it by ignoring the desired proper services so that the people can produce more. That is more so important when it comes to crops like tea and coffee. For the last three years, there have been discussions about one road in Kandara called Gaichanjiru Road. If this road is properly done, it will join Makuyu and Kigumo through Gaichanjiru. The road is due for tarmacking now that it has been approved by the Murang'a District Development Committee. Therefore, when we go for Recess, the Ministries concerned should give this road all ± serious thoughts.Sir, the last point I want to mention is on the commission which was dealing with electoral boundaries. They found it fit for Kandara Constituency to be split into two constituencies, but I would like to say that there should be two sources of water for the two constituencies instead of retaining the existing kandara Water Project. We would like one source to supply Kandara with water and another one to supply Gatanga area.With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DDAIDDO: Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to support this Motion.I would like to start by saying that both the Bible and the Koran cay that the best leaders come from poor background. We have seen that it is a poor man who rules better -and who serves the people better than a rich man. That is why His Excellency the President suggested the district focus for rural development strategy so that the rural areas are served in the right way. I do not know why some districtdevelopment committees are being misused. If every Minister took pain to chock whether his Ministry is doing justice to the people through the district development committees, that would assist in developing all areas equally. But it appears that the meaning of the district development committee has been changed. Ministries are still concentrating on the most developed areas in Kenya instead of concentrating their efforts in the less developed areas. Indeed, the meaning of the district focus for rural development strategy has been completely reversed because instead of Ministers going to the various rural areas in the country to see what is happening, they go to their own areas or prefer to visit the most developed areas.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Bible says that faith without se works has no meaning. We always say that we are supporting His Excellency the President who as we all know, visits all areas of this country. If Ministers do h£ not also visit all the areas of this country, how will they assess the rate of its development in those areas? In this respect, I would like to request the Ministry of Livestock Development to look into the mode of raising meat prices. In Nairobi City, one kilogramme of meat costs KShs.35/- How is the Ministry looking into the welfare of the small man? Pricing of meat should be done by the Ministry itself.Sir, I would also like to point out that cotton farmers should be paid immediately without any further delay. It is now the end of the year, and cotton farmers would like to be paid so that they can be able to meet their children's school fees and attend to other relevant matters.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Nairobi City Commission should know that their houses are leaking and do everything possible to rectify the situation. With the same breath, I would like to request the Government to take note of th6 fact that not all parts of Konya received rains. Therefore, they should look into ways and means of helping the unfortunate wananchi.Another point I would like to touch on is that small scale industries industry in the rural areas can afford to raise 30 per cent of the loan he would want to acquire. For that reason, the Ministry of Industry should come up with a system to help those potential small scale industrialists so that wananchi do not flock to the urban areas.Regarding strikes by university students, I would like to say that this is a very sad affair which should not be allowed to continue any more. The Government should come up with a solution to this problem because is if the situation isleft to persist further and the Government decides that university students will be paying fees, then the poor areas or students will suffer because they will not afford to pay their fees. In fact, as things are, it is the children of the rich people who initiate these problems so that poor children of this country can suffer. After all, children from rich families have chances to go to universities abroad. 	I would also like to thank the police for re-arresting that hard core convict who had escaped. That was a good workdone by the police.,With these few remarks, I beg to support</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Could the hon Members wait untilthey see the red light before they stand?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY (Dr. Ouko) : Sir. DeputySpeaker, Sir, President Moi’s record is very clear When wehad problems with. Somalia, President Moi led a strong delegationto Somalia and talked to the President of Somalia and peace wasrestored and we are now friends When the border between Kenyaand Tanzania had been closed, President Moi conducted diplomaticmissions at Head of State level; the border was opened and nowour relations with Tanzania are normal. The same thing was done with Sudan and Ethiopia; why should we have problems withUganda? It means that the problem is on the other side. We asked them to listen carefully to the appeal by President Moi that we want peace; we do not want war. But, if war is forced upon us, it will not be the first time we shall go to war and Uganda should get this message loud and clear.I want to thank the people of Kenya for the Harambee spirit that characterised this year. Millions of shillings have been collected but there cities and towns in Kenya where there is no cement. This is a season for building schools in preparation for January. I want to take this opportunity as the Minister responsible for the companies which manufacture cement to say that there is enough cement to go round and there is no reason why there should be no cement in our shops I was in Easuciu a few hours ago; there is not even one bag of cement in Kisumu town. I have on my desk this afternoon, a record of the deliveries from the factories to Kisumu town. I want to call upondistributors in kisumu town and elsewhere in the Republic tobring out the cement and not to hoard it or to use it for any unbecoming manner.Thirdly, I want to thank the Minister for Tourism and wildlife for agreeing when I spoke to him to look into the fisheries programmes Lake Victoria is teeming with fish and we want to encourage small scale industries using our resources,; In the Lake, it is the fish we can make fillet out of the fish, we can get enough fish for the people to eat as a second source of protein, and we can use the surplus fish to get income for the people. It is for this reason that my Ministry has put a stop to any fishing activity by non-Kenyans Vie want to make sure that that the industries spring up as a result of Government’s own programme for fisheries development I am grateful to the Minister for agreeing to look into this There was a World Bank scheme for fish, and I was reliably told that tire money was returned unused. This should not happen because our people are ready and they have the capacity and the knowledge to utilize such loans. Fourthly, I would like to pay very special tribute to President Moi for the way Kenya is now regarded in the world today. In my career as a diplomat and later as a Minister for Foreign Affairs, I have not come across a case where diplomats are detained or locked up it is not done. The Vienna Convention of 1961 on Diplomatic Relations forbids Such kind of things. It is bad enough when it is happening among ordinary countries; and it is very bad when it happens between neighbours. Shall we call upon Uganda to at least respect the codes of conduct approaved by the whole world community as civilised, and not to do that kind of thing they did by envoys and diplomats of Kenya in UgandaFifthly, Sir, I would like to urge wananchi all over the country to assist the snail and up comming Jua Kali jjeople. When we talk about Jua Eali we are not talking about a different group of people; we are talking about Kenyans These are Kenyans with the ability to do what they know how to do; Kenyans with the capacity to do it. It is we who do not assist them; we do not give them sub contracts to do the things that they should do. We do not give them tenders to supply the things that they manufacture. I want to suggest that in the new year, when we start our activities, things like this school desks like the one the Member for Tana River was mentioning to me though he is not here just now should be made by Jua Kali people All these Jikos used in the Youth Polytechnics should be made by the Jua Kali people. With those few remarks, I beg to support,</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. GACHANJA; Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this chance to join my colleagues in supporting this MotionsI would like to thank the Government, and particularly, the Head of State for the policy of Africanizing the Building and Construction Industry. In the past, we have been crying and begging but now the Government has heard our cry and I am happy to note that Africans are participating in the Building and Construction Industry. The only hitch which I would like to say is that the regulation for the payments for the constructors is 14 days from the date of completion, but somewhere somehow, some officials are trying to strangle the Africans. One would complete his correct which could involve about Sh.30 million to Sh.4o million and the paymentmay stay for as long as two years without being settle. This is a uncalled for and I would like to appeal to the officials concerned in the Ministry of Works, Housing said Physical Planning to see to it that these people are paid promptly.In few hours ago, we passed this Bill on the extension of tenure of the Nairobi City Commission. I would like I wish the Minister is here that although this Bill has been passed, it is not the wish of the Nairobi people to have the life of the City Commission extended. The Bill has been passed but the truth is that the Commission has not done its work properly and they must be told that. Although the Bill has been passed, the Minister must go home knowing that it is not the wish of the people But there it is; what is left for us is only to pray to God that the Commissioners are going to deliver the goods because they have not been doing so. I wouldlike to say that if the coucillors are not Those who werethere, I agree they did not do a good job and the Government may explore the possibility of banning those who are not acceptable from participating in the elections and therefore, the elections can be held without those councillors who were there before. The truth is that the residents of Nairobi want councillors and it is for the Government to consider when is the opportune time. 	On the City Commission, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to inform the Minister that he has been deceived by his Commissioners that all is well in Nairobi. Let him visit places like Dagoretti and look at the roads there. I believe that the Nairobi City Commission has squandered more money than the former City Council of Nairobi. So, the Minister should go and inspect all the clinics in the City and see what is happening. If something is not done quickly these clinics and health centres are going to start spreading diseases instead of treating them. I would like to suggest that all these health institutions in the City should be placed under the Ministry of Health instead of being run by the Nairobi City Commission. This is because the Nairobi City Commission is doing nothing.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to say something regarding those depositors who had money in the Rural Urban and Credit Bank Limited and the Continental Bank. The Attorney-General is here I am sure hat he listens to the problems of these people. I would like him to do something about this problem. I am sure that he is capable of assisting these depositors. Some depositors were paid only KShs.5,000/-. There is a lot of money which is still lying there and people are panicking and I would like the Attorney-General to do something about this problem; maybe his own signature is enough to enable these people to be paid whatever is left in those financial institutions.The other point is about "Jua Kali" artisans. The Minister for Industry is here and I would like to tell him that we ,do not have any "Jua Kali" shades in Dagoretti. I would therefore like the Minister for Industry to explore the possibility of</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. ole Tipis.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER OF STATE, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. ole Tipis): Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I would like to join my hon. colleagues in supporting this Motion which is very timely. Christmas is approaching and it is time we went back home to join our constituents in celebrating Christmas.Having said that, I would like to point out that we in Kenya, must, from the bottom of our hearts, congratulate His Excellency the President, hon. Daniel Toroitich arap Moi, for the way he has conducted the affairs of this country. He has worked tirelessly for the people of this country. He works 24 hours a day. He goes around tills country serving Ms people and his nation. Kenya has never had it so good before. So, all Kenyans should thank His Excellency the President most heartedly for what he has done for us and for what he continues to do for this country. This country has never had it so good and we pray God that in the coming year things will be better. Of late a few things have been happening along our common border with Uganda. But as we all know there is no tiling to panic about. We are capable of defending ourselves. We are not provoking anybody. We can only pray that peace prevails in that country. The people of that country should not attempt to provoke us. They should not violate our territorial integrity. If they do so then they should not blame us for whatever happens. But the truth is that our soldiers are still in their barracks. This is because we regard the problem at the border to be a normal problem which can be handled by the police. It does not matter whether the Ugandan Government gets support from outside. Our support comes from within us. We are watching the situation very, very closely and if things get worse we will act. We are capable of hitting very hard if not harder. So, as we adjourn, we should tell our people that unity is our strength.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, our unity is very important especially at this time when we are getting threats from a neighbouring country. We should be more united in this country and face whatever comes our way. But as of now we are capable of defending curselves.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as leaders we should not pretend at all. Let us not, for God's sake, preach a gospel we do not believe in. We believe in the Nyayo Philosophy; which is peace, love and unity. Let us create peaced and pray that our enemies live in peace. Our enemies do not wish us well but we wish them well; we wish them peace in their country.So, as we go home, let us get our people together and prepare themI beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. WAMEYO: Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to speak on this Motion. Peace is a very important status in a country. We in Muni as would like to pay great tribute to His Excellency the President for maintaining peace in this country. We do hope that the small problem we have been having at the border will come to an end so that we continue living in peace.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, sugar cane farmers in Mumias are very grateful to the Government for increasing the price of sugar cane last year, by KShs.41/- per tonne and instructing the sugar factories not to increase the charges on services. I am very grateful to the Ministry of Agriculture for reducing the price of transporting cane cutters from KShs.5.90 per tonne of cane to KShs.2.00 leaving KShs.3.90 for the farmer. DR. WALIEYO (ctd);Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Agriculture went farther and abolished administration levy of KShs.3.30 per tonne of cane. So, last year the farmers were awarded KShs. 48.20 per tonne of cane without an increase in the charges charged by the companies. Because of that the morale of the farmers has improved and a lot of sugar cane has been produced to the extent that on	Monday, 14.12.87, at the HotelInter Continental, the Mumias Sugar Company declared dividends and paid to the Treasury, KShs.42 million. This was as a result of the profits the Company made in preparation of sugar from the cane produced by the farmersThis has  happened as a result of peace in the country. Ever since I started talking about sugar-cane in this august House, the Government started receiving dividends. The first year it received Sh.tf million the second year Sh.24 million; the other year Sh.30 million, and this year Sh.42 million. So, the dividends of the Government are going up. On the other hand, the farmers are very happy too, because hat they are getting is enough to pay for services end leave something extra for buying shoes. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the farmers have put a request to the Government. When they were producing maize, whenever they sent maize to the National Cereals and Produce Board (N.C.P.B.) they were refunded transport and the cost of the gunny bags in which they put the maize. Today, the farmers are charged for transporting sugar¬cane from their shambas to the mills according to the distance. They pay Sh.70 for transporting a tonne of sugar-cane from the field to the mills. The highest charge is Sh.85 per tonne of sugar-cane, which is paid by the farmers who are very far away from the mills, such as those in Siaya, Busia and Lurambi South. The farmers would like to put it to the Government that it would be better if the factory did not charge for transporting sugar-cane to the mills, just as mize producer are not charged for transport, . But if they must pay at all, it would be if tliey shared the cost equally, so that the farmers can have some more extra money to improve their fields.	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir; as we realise, the cost of living has risen. This is why the farmers literally refused to pay Sh.36 per kg of meat, and went for fish. This continued until the butchers had no option but to reduce the price of meat per kg to Sh.32. Even though, the farmers in Murias are still not very interested in buying that meat, because they feel that! that price is exorbitant.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, with those few remarks, I beg to support the Motion</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FORENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES (Mr. Nassir): Bw.

ASIYO: Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, very many Questions have been raised andin this House and which were not answered by the Ministries because of lack of time. I would like to appeal to all those Ministries to act on those Questions which were put to them but could not be answered. Some of them were very, very important especially those that dealt on matters touching on security as well as development of our country. The people in the rural areas and backward areas need a lot of assistant to develop.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as many of the hon. Members have saidhere, Kenya has invested quite a lot in peace which has facilitated thefast development of our country, both politically and economically.I feel that we still need to invest more in peace so that those whoare still doubtful can be sure that they are in the right leadershipthe right system of Government and also in the right country.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, perhaps I think it would be a good ideato take a few of our University students to a tour of some African country so that they can see how our brothers and sisters in some of those great; African countries like Nigeria and Ghana and the rest live. Perhaps after this visit they would come back with much more appreciation than they already have now.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think Kenya should, buy both air and television time, especially in the Western countries, or in some of the Western countries where Kenya has been attacked in the newspapers every day. Each time you open up a newspaper, somebody is sort of attacking Kenya. I think we should buy both air and T.V. time in those countries and show them films about us. Let them see how we organise Ilarambee here, and see how even the very poorest of our people give the little money that he/she has for the development of the community. Let our diplomats also spare no efforts in answering some of these Western journalists who have taken it upon themselves to be attacking us and also to be the mouth pieces of some of the people attacking this country.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I wish to express the goodwill of the Karachuonyo people whom I have represented here since 1979 their loyalt and support to His Excellency the President, the Part, as well as the Government. His Excellency's job is very ah unenviable. It is a very difficult task, and yet we know that there is no corner in this country that His Excellency the President does not visit. We know that he knows the truth about every corner of this nation. He knows the truth about every leader in this country, and we would wish to feel that those trouble shooters, liars and mean politicians who will use their1 thorax to destablise other well meaning politicians would be silenced before our next elections so that we can have peaceful elections. I appeal to such men and women to start behaving like gentlemen and ladies, and to observe the democratic institution which we cherish in this country so that we can avoid interference with the development of the ordinary mwananchi whose only wish is to develop, or to live a little bit better than he lived last year.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I want to appeal to the Minister for Agriculture to give us some tractors for hire in Karachuonyo because most of our cattle died. Often we have had oxen driven ploughs, but we have no cattle now. So, we need some tractors for hire during the next season so that we can have sufficient food.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, maintenance of roads has already been talked about, but I also want to mention it in passing. The Ministry of Transport and Communications should do as much as it can to facility;the movement of school children and school milk as well as to open up roads to fish beaches, markets, to both primary and secondary schools and make it easier for our people to move.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, cotton farmers must be paid on time. There is no reason why Kenya should be importing cotton from Japan and other countries overseas when Karachuonyo alone can provide enough cotton to run all the textile industries in the country.With those few remarks, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. Okondo): Thank you, Mr. DeputySpeaker, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to join my colleagues inwishing everybody, from yourself, a merry Christmas and a happy new yearI also wish my colleagues in the House who have given me support throughoutthe year a merry Christmas and a happy new year too. I also wishHis Excellency the President who has taken so much of his time tolead the nation at many great risks, a merry, merry Christmas and a happy new year, and also a successful 1988,Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this country today is on its proper footing because of the leadership of His Excellency the President for the way he has directed us, he has managed the economy, and also managed personal relations. That is why we are here speaking democra¬tically.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to express particular gratitude to him because of what he has done on the Western border. Right now it is quiet on the Western frontier.	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is quite largely because of the great restrain  His Excellency the President has shown in not deploying the military forces and only having the administration policemen to control the border. When I visited the border a few days ago, I found that the administration policeman were dressed mostly in camouflage; they had guns and had kept the enemy properly on his side. That is what the success of His Excellency the President has about in keeping cool when, the tempers were running wild. It is a pity to see beautiful buildings that used to be, are pocked with bullet all over the place and are very badly damaged. Fortunately, none of our people was killed as we hear that a number of their soldiers were killed.I believe that the National Resistance Army (HRA), Museveni andother leaders should have read us properly and got the message. No matterhow much they plan, there is no way they can possibly win. Whatever theirtarget is, they must abandon it because we are sure to win and they oughtto get that message and keep quiet. What Uganda should be doing is toreally thank us for helping their systems to work. This is because theyneed us more than we need them and they really ought to co-operate with us. Unfortunately, the history of Uganda shows very clearly that every dictator or ruler who comes up in that country, wants a part of Kenya. Why should they want a part of Kenya and yet they have the border? We are given them a warning that that will not happen. It is much better they stay home and run their affairs in a friendly atmosphere and attitude to Kenya and they will succeed?Sir, I would also like to take this opportunity to repeat what I said earlier in this House that we have a lot of time to do what is good, to build up relationships and bridges amongst us as politicians, Members of Parliament and the community. We have a lot of time to do that. Very often, instead of using that time to build, good relationships and friendliness, we use it for fighting one another and to spread bitterness. We should spendthat in building bridges and being friends. This is because there is a lot of development work to be done, so much so that if you look around, you will just wonder why-we have not done, that it and when ire will do it. A lot of my hon. colleagues spend time trying to undermine and destroying others instead of concentrating in helping to grow more grass bananas and in assisting in road construction, helping a friend to get home and feed the next child or get a dress for the next child. Most of our time, as politicians should not be spent on fighting one another. If we turn around, we will find that we still have time to do so. We should help each other rather than fight each other. Why should we fight each other so much? We have all done a good job. From the records of this House this Year, I must say that I have received splendid support from the hon. Members of this House whether from the Back-Bench or not in the work that has been done by Ministry. I do expect that that kind of good spirit and co-operation will continue' while we are on recess until we come back. It is my Wish that when we come back, we shall still have that good spirit of co-operation.I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTISO: Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.

It was rather unique, in the history of this Parliament, that the House that the House has had to ajourn sine die twice Because of the very unique reasons, wewere called back and I am glad that we have performed the duty which we were called for.Having said that, I would like to join my colleagues who have expressed the view that the House should adjourn so that we can go and carry out Kanu recruitment drives. I would also like to wish the hon. Members a merry Christmas and a properous new year. I would like to remind them that the meaning of Christmas which we are looking forward to is a time when the Saviour of the world was born. It was at this time that the world had maximum peace and that is why our Lord is called the Prince of Peace. He was born at a time when there was absolute peace in the world after many years of vigorous wars between the Greeks and the Romans. It was because of this that Emperor Augustus Ceasar found it necessary to know the number of the people that he was ruling, and called for a census. We know that there was only one capital city in the world in those days. That city was called Rome and Augusts Ceasar was living there. Our Saviour was born when the census was going on. There was peace at that time.I would like to wish the hon. Members of this House and,the country in general that same peace which our Lord gave us. This isbecause He said that he is giving us peace and leaving us with his peace.When we go back home, we should enjoy Christmas with that kind of peaceand ensure that our country with that atmosphere.	The only thing that I would like to caution our people in thattheir imaginations should end with what Uganda has done. I still cautionthis country to be on the alert. This is because we keep on hearing thatLibya is sending forces to Uganda. We can only suspect that they areRe-organising themselves for even a major operation in Kenya. This isbecause we cannot see the reasons why they are amassing such a number offorces and why Libyan forces are coming into Uganda. Whom are they going to fight? We know that Uganda has not been atawar with any other country except when they attempted to attack Kenya. Perhaps, they are dreaming that if they use Libyan forces, they can still come and attack Kenya. It is on this note that I would like to alert our people and our armed forces to keep an eye and keep these people on close watch and monitor their movements and activities. In this way, any move they make towards Kenya will be answered for squarely.	. ;I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. J.N. MUNGAI: Thank you very much, Mr. DeputySpeaker, Sir, for giving me a chance to join my colleagues inwishing the hon. Members of this House a very merry Christmas and a happy and prosperous new year most of all, let me wish.His Excellencjr the President a merry Christmas and a happy and prosperous new year.let me start by thanking his Excellency the President forthe manner in which he has steered this country and /for the amount of work he has done in my constituency, part¬icularly. By saying so, I have in mind the farmers there, who the President has come to rescue often-times. I remember when the pyrethrum farmers were not paid, and His Excellency the President, after a long time, came in intervened, look for money from wherever he did, and the farmers were eventually paid, even though it was after one and a half years.Let me also not forget to thank him for rescuing the cereals farmers when they had not been paid for the crop they had delivered to the National Cereals and Produce Board. Imme¬diately he intervened, they were paid. I am appealing that when these farmers start delivering the new crop which is already in the stores and ready for delivery, the people manning the National Cereals and Produce Board come forward and pay for the crop as per the instructions by His Excellency the President that the crop be paid for on delivery.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, historians. Will write, and do so several times and I believe that the paper fromwebuye may not be enough to write on whatever His Excellency/the President has done for this country. let me not forget the Nyayo in my area. I know he has helped put up Nyayo wards in other areas of the country, but in Elburgon, in my own constituency, he has put up the first Nyayo hospital.On behalf of my people in Nakuru west Constituency, let me not forget to thank His Excellency the President for starting the first Nyayo hospital in Elburgon. let me assure the hon. Members that when it comes to the time of the Harambee funds drive in that place, they will see, not a Nyayo ward, but a Nyayo hospital. It is magnificent; it is one that will leave history in that place; it is one that is not a tent but a magnificence that will live and live to be remembered in that place for a long time.Let me also now talk ii about the forest workers whomI represent. I say I represent them because I think half ofthe inhabitants of Nakuru West are forest workers. I can see thatthe Minister for Environment and Natural Resources is here. AllI can say is that I know that; in recent times, they havebeen disturbed here and there, being told to remove theiranimals from the forest and being told to stop cultivatingthe small shambas they have been cultivating in the forest.Let me only appeal to the Minister once again that these peoplekept these animals, not because they wanted to keep them ontheir own, but they sou.ght for permission to start keeping them.When they started keeping them, they were allowed a maximum.and a maximum of the number of animals they were supposed tokeep. Let me appeal to the Minister to allow these people tokeep at, least two cows, one calf, one bull, 10.sheep and one donkey for their transport, other than, just telling them to keep theanimals off the forest. What is wrong in the people using donkeys to transport their goods to the forest stations where they work so harmoniously for the Government? We all know that the roads in the forest stations are so bad, and it is just impossible for matatus buses or trucks to go tothe forest. These people can only transport their requirements by using donkeys.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we know that the school children in this country are being given milk £ in schools. If these children go back to their forest homes only to miss, milk, what shall we say we are doing? We know that these animals can be controlled from causing any soil erosion in that place, I know they can cause gully erosion but ,in any case, they are also helping to cut  short the grass and in so doing chase away the rats which might  eat the tree seedlings. I would, now like to talk about Uganda.	Ugandans arejust forgetting what they should be doing.	MUseveni isonly mortgaging his  country to fight a nation which has been consolidating for the last 24 years.   We. are too strong to be moved by ViUseveni.	He  should be im told,  in no underlain terms,that we fought  the colonialists	'Le unity.   We did that withoutany stability.	This time,  we have had our Independence andwe are stable.	The  same unity vie used to hick out the colonialists who were in this country is the same unity we are going to use of museveni.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR.  KAMUREN:  Thank you' very much, The  Deputy Speaker, for also  giving me this opportunity to  join my colleagues in supporting this Motion. Mine is very short  and  I will not have to take a lot of time.	I would like to thank His Excellency the President forwhat he has done for this people in this country.	Immediatelyhe took over the leadership of this country,	he moved from onelocation,  district  and province to the other in an endeavour to help the wananchi,  particularly in-conducting Harambee funds., drives. 	The .President. has taught  us from time to tithe that we be mindful of other people’s welfare, as leaders of this country.If we did this, with the unity we have,  entrenched in our hearts, .as leaders in this country, we would always remain to reap the fruits of our Uhura.We know that right now we leaders in this country,   the security personnel in this country, particularly the police,the special branch and the Criminal Investigation Department.Whenever our people move from one comer of the country to theother, they do so with a lot of confidence, particularly sincethey know that they have people who can protect them wherever they are. This is very important. Some of these officers who have a lot of experience in p security work should be given promotions and they should be taken care of by the Government so that they know that  whatever they do is recognized. They should be given promotions as per their knowledge and their performance at their plaices of work.We know that what is going in Uganda at the moment is not pleasing to us because we are here to protect our sovere¬ignty. We have never gone across the border said into Uganda. Our policemen did a good job in chasing away the National Resistance Army soldiers who wanted to invade our land. We have to make it clear in this n House, as leaders, that we are not prepared, in any case, to interfere with what is happening in our neighbouringstates. We want to protect ourselves and do whatever we do in Kenya to remain as Kenyans. We have never provoked anybody, and we do not wish to do so.When we d go on recess, I would like the Ministers in this House to see if they can spare time to move from one  place to another to help wananchi in raising money for building workshops in primary schools. I am saying this because a Minister is appointed to run a Ministry, and that Ministry is supposed to serve the 22 million people of this country. Wehave a Minister, Assistant Ministers and a Permanent Secretary , in every Ministry. Each of these people should be able to move from one corner of this Republic to the other. Let them all be seen by sees wananchi.As concerns afforestation, to protect ourselves from desertification, we have to plant trees in order to conserve soil.With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech> (Hon. Naibori stood up in his place and, bent over the seat in front of him)<Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Haveyou noticed what hon. Mbori did? He virtually want over the hack of the seatin front of him to make sure that I was not seen by the Chair Is that in order.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES (Mr. Michuki): Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for granting me this opportunity so that I may join my colleagues in supporting this Motion and make my personal contributionFirst and foremost, I would like to use this opportunity in extendingmy Christmas greetings to His Excellency the President, my own constituents and all of my hon. colleaguss in this House. I also greet the staff of the National Assembly who have served us well during the period that we have been here.I would also like to thank His Excellency the President on behalf of my constituents for the most successful Harambee funds drive that he presided over and conducted in my constituency last month. My constituents are very appreciative of the fact and very happy that Citugi Girls Secondary School was so highly honoured by the presence of His Excellency the President there.Quite a lot has been said by the previous speakers, so I think that all I can add within the time available to me is that unity of purpose is paramount. As the previous speakers have said, wananchi want to see the unity of leaders demonstrated by action. It is not enough just to talk about it; wananchi rant to see this unity in action. In this respect we need unity now more than ever before, particularly now that there are signs that Uganda wantsto use reverse reasons to divert its own people's attention from its own internal problems trying to play what looks like, if I may say so, “a monkey business”across our border.Some hon. Members here, particularly the hon member for Enuhaya, knowthat I have lived at that border for two years as a district officer. I know that our people are very peaceful and that they could not have done anything that might have contributed to the provocation of Ugandans. Indeed, I have been wondering what has been happening because His Excellency the President has already said that maintaining the security of Kenyans is his paramount duty. If Ugandans wanted to test that statement, its truth has been very promptly and adequately proved by action, Therefore, we hope that wisdom will prevail in Uganda. He are not begging for respect to our Head of State.Particularly, the document that was produced here by the hon. Member for Mathare annoyed a lot of us because by its very implication, it touched on every Kenyan. I had the occasion of being in an international meeting of African countries where 39 countries passed a vote of thanks to our President, His Excellency Daniel arap Moi, without dissent. I think that Uganda ought to note that. Our Leader in Kenya has acquired that very high respect.With those few remarks, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Mr. Mak’Anyengo): Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to join my colleagues on this Motion. I support the Motion because we need to go back to our constituencies and help in the recruitment of Kanu members, which is not doing very well at the moment.In my contribution, I would like to thank the President for all that he has done for this country and for ensuring that there is stability and securityin this country, although some lunatics are trying to interfere with our stability. It is my feeling that when one is dealing with a mad fellow, he should speak a language that the latter understands. Similarly, when you are dealing with a bush man, you should talk to him in a language that he can understand, that is "bush" language.It is most unfortunate that the President of Uganda has underrated the capability of Kenya to reply to him0 I hope that he is not going to provoke us more than he has already done. If he thought that Kenyans are divided, we would like to let him know that we are fully united behind our Government h and President. If he plays about, we will show him what he needs to be shown. Having dealt with that point, I would now like to thank the Government for what it has done in my constituency. We thank it for the provision of water and health facilities in the area. However, there are still other things that need to be attended to, particularly, by the Ministry of transport and Communications. During the last short rainy season, many roads were washed away, and I would like to appeal to the Ministry to look into this matter. In order to understand the problem, I would like to call upon the Minister and his Assistant Ministers to try to tour Nyanza, particularly Ndhiwa. For four years now, none of these hon. Members has toured the place0 I would now call upon them to tour the place and check on what is going on there. Oria Bridge, for example, and other bridges in the area axe falling apart, and we request the Ministry to repair them so as to facilitate smooth communication in the area.As for the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife, it is high time that it attended to Lambwe National Park. There was a plan for the fencing off of the area, but the fencing was done in such a way that wild animals keep on coming out to disturb wananchi. We would request the Ministry to use some of the funds that have been allocated to it to improve the roads in that national park so as to attract tourists. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I know that the election fever is now on and.I know, too, that there are very many politicians who are trying their luck. Theadvice we would like to give them is that they should stick to the rules of the game.In other words, if they want to contribute towards development through the Harambee  meetingsthese meetings should not be turned into political rallies for campaigns. I amsaying this, Sir, because it has been happening in South Nyanza, particularly, in Ndhiwa. In addition to that, there has also been some budding politicians who thinkthat for them to go through, they have to plant certain candidates in variousareas. Those who have been thinking that they can plant candidates in Ndhiwa,are wrong. I stand here now to tell them that they are having degunms becausethe Ndhiwa people are quite alert and they know exactly what to do. So, those who thinkingare thinking of planting some candidates in that constituency, are having dagdunmsIn conclusion, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would also like to warn the civilservants who intend to become politicians that the rule of the game is that theyare supposed to resign before they become politicians.With those few remarks, I bog to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: Ahsante sana, Bv. Naibu Spiica, kwa kunipatia nafasi hii.Kwaoza, ningetaka kukunhukuxu kwa kunipatia nafasi hii. Ningetaka kukutakia heri pamo ja na jamii yako xxess. Kriscasi nzuri na mwaka mpya mwenye mafanikio mena. Vile vile, niceuatakia Wabunge wote na wananchi to te kwa jumla Krismasi nzuri na mwaka mpya.Jambo la pili ni kwamba ningetaka kuchukua nafasi hii kuwaambia Maofisn wa Sau ti ya Kenya kvainba ukweli utadumu. Mirai ninajua kwamba wale waandishi wa habari wa Sauti ya Kenya katika Bunge hili9huandika marieno yanayosemwa katika Bunge hili. Lakini lama wakubva kule ccfazn ofisini ambao kazi yao ni kuyakata maneno yanayosemwa na Wabunge na kuyatupilia mbali. Ingefaa wajue kwamba sikumoja wao wenyewe “watakatwa.”Bw. Naib Spika, juzi niliita Piess Conference kuseraa juu ya mkutano wa Harambee uliofanywa katika sehemu ya ahe. Angatia.Baada ya ule mkutano wa Harambee, Sauti ya Kenya ilisema kuaiciba “Bw. Shikuku alichanga Shs.8,000 katika sehomu ya mhe. Angatia” Lakini ukweli uliandikwa katika gazeti la Standard. Miai sikuto a Shs.8,000/-, bali mlitoa shs.3,000/- na nikatoa post dated cheque ya Shs.650/- Mimisiwezi kutoa Shs.8,000/-. Wkifanya hivyo, watoto wangu watakula nlni	Pesa zangu ni zangu birmfsi|iia si zangu na marafiki wangu. NinawashukuruKiiieshimiwa Ifabunge vengire walioniambia, "tumesikia kwamba utakwenda kwa mkutanoua Karambee na icvra hivyo, tuiiataka kukupatia pesa", niliwaambiaj, "hapana".</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. MUNYAO: Edio, tulikuvis tayari lcukupatiai</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SSIKUKU: Hata mhe. Munyao yuko hapa na ana3eaa kwamba walikuwatayari kunipatia hizo pesa, lakini niLiwaarabia nikizichukua pesahizo na mxao ja wao afanye makosa, sitaweza kumtoa makosa hayo kwa sababu nitakuwanikifildria juu ya pesa anfoaao alizonipatia. Kwa hivyo, ninataka kubakihuru ili niweze kuyasema maneno yaliyo mabaya kwa ratu yeyote bila kufikiriakwamba alinipatia pesa za Harambee.Jambo lxngine, Bw. Naibu Spika, linahueu mseso kwamba tunatalca mikutano ya Harambee peke yake, na ikiwa unataka ioizungumza katika E±e mkutano wa Harambee, ni laziaa kwanza utoe pesa. Jain bo hili ni kunyume cha Kifungu nasfoari 78 cha Katiba ya Kenya. 2ii laaima kila ntu awe na uhuru wa kusema, iwe ss ana pesa au hana pesa. Euu jnchezo ambao umeanza sasa ambapo ikiwa k huna pesa huwezi kuzungumsa katika mkutano wa Haraabee? s±a%£ utalifanya tpunge hili lijae watu wakubwa walio na pesa na wale maskini vatabaki nyuma na watoto vac, hata w_akifundishwa, watakuwa vakipoteza wakati. Hasema hivyo kwa sababu hawatawes, kuwa tfabunge katika Bunge hili kwa vile wanatoka katika jamii saski ni. Jsinbo hili ni kinyume cha uhuru tuliopigania.	Jambo lingins aabalo ningetaka kutaja Jinahusu habari ya wapiguia kura Himoaoma katika raagazeti kwamba mimi nimesema maneno yasiyo ya kweli, lakini ukweli ni kwamba mini siyasemi maneno yasiyo ya kweli. Ukweli ni kwamba kuna wakubwa wengine ambao wanataka kEgss kuitumia Edkutano ya Harambee kuwaweka wapinzaci wa Habunge walioka hapa Bungeni, ili wawapinge kule. Hi laziina watu hawa wajue kvramba watavuna matunda ya maova yao. Mimi nineambiwa ki aaba taid. la Kaau lilipokuvja likikutaaa, lilisema ka kwamba ess niliyasema maneno haya katika ule mkutano vsu. Kabras, lakini ni ukweli ni kwamba sikuyasoma maneno hayo. MfcirkainiBa hivj0 hata leatllca Press Conference na si.tayaondoa yale nili yosema katika Press Conference wala sitaoniba msamaLa lrwa sababu ninajua niliyoseoa ni yakweli. Wananchi si wapuinbavu na wanajua niirani an&fanyana nini. Wengi wa Wabunge aihbao wanafanya mainbo maovu hawataliona Bunge hili tena. Watasikia kwamba Shikuku ajnerudi hapa, lakini wao hawatarudi hapa.Jaubo lingine arabalo range taka kusema linaiiusu udanganyifu wakati wa uchaguzi. Sisi iuaataka uuoja, demokrasia, aznezd. na mapenzi. Ikiwa iiaki itafanywa, ni lasima wakati wa uchaguzi ujao wananchi wapewe nafasi ya kui achagua si wale wanao taka na si wale ainbao watu wengine wanasemaj "huyu ni ustii wa Serikali". Hi lazima wananchi wapewe uhuru wa kuwachagua wale wanaotaka na hatutaki maofisa wa utaiTala au watu wengine wauingilie uhuru wa wananchi. Kwa hivyo , ni. lazima wananchi wapewe nafasi ya kuwachagua wale watu wanaotaka na si kuanibiwa, "huyu anatakiwa lakini yule hatakiwi". Vile vile, hatutaki znanexio ya pesa yaingilie uchaguzi. Hari wananchi wale pesa za wakubwa kwa sababu pesa hizo ni o zao anibazo waliiba. Hata. Mtakatifu Ambrose alisema, "All that is given, is usually vjhat was taken from the people and is being returned to them". Someni katika lei tabu kinachoitwa, "In God's name" by David Yalop. Kwa hivyo, hata Mtakatifu Ambrose anajua kwarnba wale wenye kutoa pesa nyingi walisinyakua na kwa hivyo, wanazirudisha na ni hsri 9l-fenc wananchi wasipokee kwa oikono yote.Bw. iiaibu Spika, kuhusu watu walio na pesa nyingi. ningetaka kuwaamba waje laile Butere ili kuwasaidia watu wa fegc huko. Ningetaka wafike kule Butere na kuzimwaga posa zile kule ili watu wa Butere wafaidike. Kasema hivyo kvra sababu tunajua kwamba duae wako akimpanda ng'onibe wangu, yule ng'ombe anapozaa, yule ndama paaoja, na maziwa. ya mama yake yanakuwa ja na dume wako hawezi kukuletea chochote. Kwa hivyo, tuko tayari kuwapokea na kwa hivyo, tungetaka laisichukuwa pesa hizo kule Butere.Kwa hayo machache, nknawatakieni watu wo te Krismasi nzuri pamoja na mvraka mpa. Naunga mkono.</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>MR. KOSKE: Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving methis opportunity to, also, contribute to this Motion. First of all, I would urge theGovernment to see to it that all the promises that have been made by the Ministers,while answering various Questions in this House, are fulfilled because wananchiare waiting for them. Also, Sir, I would like to urge Government to see to it thatthe acaracides for cattle dips are always made available. If they anticipate anyktrshortage in future at all, they should warn farmers, in advance, to exercise extra care.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would also like to urge the Government to seeto it that the survey work, which is going on in the various areas where subdivisionof land has not been completed, is accelerated. The issuance of the title deedsshould also be expedited so that they can be issued to wananchi as soon as possible.At the same time, Sir, the Rural Development Funds which are meant for rural developmentprojects should be handled by the local committeemembers of such areas where the projectsare situated, instead of allowing the district development officers to handle suchfunds alone. The local committee members should be able to know, right from thebeginning to the end, the projects being undertaken in their area so that thereis no argument as to how much the project is to spend, or the question of sayingthat some of the money was not well spent.	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I also urge Government to see to it that local contractorare given the first periority in handling projects which they are capable of handling.I would also like to urge Government to see to it that local materials are used inour ran projects. I am saying this because it has been reckoned that some peopleare buying and transporting timber from as far as 60 miles, whereas they could buy timberfrom within the locality where the project is being established. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would also to urge the Government to ensure that the National Cereals and Produce Board opens more grain buying centres so that farmers can sell their grain in time. It is very surprising to hear that some of the farmers who have is sold their maize to the National Cereals and Produce Board have not been paid up to now, although it has been said that payment should be done on delivery. We do not want to repeat this matter every now and then and, therefore, those farmerswho have not yet been paid should be paid immediately.Sir, sometimes in the past, the Kenya Co-operative Creameris was requested to establish milk buying centres in respective convenient places to farmers, and I would like to urge the Government to ensure that this exercise is accelerated.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we thank the Government very much for the formation of new locations in various areas, but we would like to point out that quite a number of these locations have not yet received adequate personnel. For that reason, I would like to urge the Government to ensure that new chiefs are employed to man such locations. It should also be taken into account that these new locations will also have councilors to represent them in the respective local authorities.Sir, a number of Motions were passed in this House in the course of this ending Session, and wananchi are waiting to see the implementation of such Motions taking place. Some of us do not want wananchi to be let down and, therefore, the Ministers concerned should see to it that all the Motions which have been passed in this House are implemented as soon as possible.With those few remarks, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support theMotion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR RESEARCH, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (Dr. Karanja): I thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to make a few remarks in support of this Motion.I would like to start by saying that this House wants to confirm and re-affirm that as a nation or as a democracy, we shall not be diverted from ourchosen path of development under the wise leadership of our President, His Excellency Daniel arap Moi. I would also like to state that we, as Kenyans, are not against foreigners as it is being alleged in the foreign Press. We are not afraid of them either. On the contrary, we welcome foreigners in this country. After all, we have very many foreigners who live here and they are very much welcome. What we do not want are people who are here with the intention of subverting our society. All those foreigners who are well intentioned are welcome to come here and stay. I would like, particularly, to mention the propagandist station called British Broadcasting Corporation, which was at one time regarded as the most reliable broadcasting organisation in the world. Today, the station has become an organ of propaganda and it is clearly biased against Kenya. I think we should say that the people they choose to comment on Kenyan affairs are very well known marxists and rebels. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the views expressed by these people are meant to create discord, among our people. I would there¬fore like to appeal to the British Broadcasting Corporation to be more level-headed and produce more balanced reports on Kenyan affairs without any bias or propaganda. We are here to support His Excellency the President in his efforts to improve the standards of living of our people. We are supporting him completely and steadfastly and we will continue to do so because we want to strengthen and enhance our democracy so that all the people of Kenya are given equal opportunities to develop their own skills and their own ways of life.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to wish my colleagues here and my constituents and all the people of Kenya a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. We will meet next year. Thank you.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Mr. Mweu): Nakushukuru sana Bw. Naibu Spika.

Now, according to the Programme, we are supposed to end at quarter past Six(6.15 p.m.) but because we normally rise at 6.30 p.m., I want to use my discretion to enable a few more hon. Members to speak.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Maiyani): Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for "catching" your eye.I wish to support this Motion, and by doing so, first of all,I want to congratulate His Excellency the President for his tirelesswork throughout this year which has been very glorified. His Excellencythe President has conducted countless Harambee meetings all over theRepublic, and Nyeri has probably been the leading beneficiary of hiskind words. I wish to thank him very sincerely on behalf of the peopleof Nyeri for his love for us, and we reciprocate very dearly. I alsowish to thank him for the various projects which have been assistedby the Government in my Constituency of Mukurweini.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I also would like to express the desire of the people of Mukurweini for our very short road, Mukurweini to Sagana, which is on the programme for tarmac king. I pray avid hope that in the new year we shall get this gift. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would also like to express the loyalty to the President, the Government and the Party of the people of Mukurweini anu Nyeri as a whole. I would like to impress upon this House and the rest of the Republic of that very dedicated loyalty. I would like the people to forget what is going on and wait for the coming elections and see that Nyeri is going to express its loyalty in action. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, with regard to this ugly provocation that we are facing on our western border, the people of Nyeri are 100 per cent behind the President and the Government. We will support the defence of our country without any fear or hesitation. It is well known that our Independence was not given on a silver platter. Our people throughout the Republic, struggled and fought bravely against the colonia.1 oppression. It is known that many of our neighbours, more or less, got their Independence on a silver platter. They have no value and understanding of patriotism and nationalism. If they did, they would not mess their country for personal ambition, individual or group leadership but they would value the unity of their country. I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

Naibu Spika, ukisafiri katika Nairobi NationalPark, utaona keamba upan.de uaaopakana na Narok umezingirwakwa waya, Vile vile, upande unaopalcana na Hachakos umezingirwalava kutumia waya ili kuzuia wanyana wasiingie mashamabani ya watu. Lakini upande &s unaopakana na Ivitengela umeachwa wazi.Watu wengi wamepot eza maisha yao kwa sababu wanyama wakimalizanyasi katika Nairobi National Park huruka, mto wa Kitengelana kuingia katika mashamba ya watu. Tungependa ku.valisha watuwa sehemu hiyo na wa Nairobi kwa nyama na maziwa, lakini hatuwezikufanya hivyo kz lava sababu wanya.ma wa mwituni wanawasuiabua sana.Kwa hivyo, ombi langu ni a Serikali itafute pesa kama zilesilisopatikana pande hi si zingine za Nairobi National Park zilipozingirwa9ili upande ii ule wa kwetu pia uzingirwe. Ningeiomba Serikali pia iwa,punguze wanyama hawa wakizidi,Lisamashamba yao. Wanyama hao wasiachiliwe kujaa kila maliali.Ni kweli tunapata fedha kutokana na hawa wanyama, lakini manufaa yoyot hakimaambayo wakulima wana,pata. Serikali peke yake ndiyo hupata manuf aa.Kwa hayo machache, naiuiiga Hoja hii mkono.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. M'luaitsi) : Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this short time to air my views, first to give thanks to His Excellency the President and wish him the best on Christmas day and, also, wish my colleagues,	with whom I have workedliingeiomoa berikaii pia iwapunguze wanyama. hawa wakizidi xxz kama vile wakulima wanavyo punguza together in this House throughout this year, the beet on Christmas day and, also, wish my people of Tiriki Division a merry and quiet Christmas day and a happy new year.I am, indeed, thankful to what the Government has tried to achieve in Tiriki Division, which has now confirmed Tiriki Division as a constituency. Many will not be surprised to find me come here next year as the hon. Member for the new Tiriki Constituency; they should not be surprised. Hamisi was a Nubian, and we have been fighting to it get rid of that name. Now we have a division called Tiriki and not Hamisi.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the achievement we have had through the Ministry of Energy and Regional Development through the Kenya Power and Lighting Company Limited by having rural elec¬trification will bring great development in the division and. I am pleased to thank the Government for that. I would also like to thank the Government for having erected a huge store through the National Cereals and Produce Board whereby the people of Tiriki will be able to get foodstuff easily.When we speak here and outside as hon. Members of Parliament, we must always watch what we say because we are leaders, and if we p speak carelessly, we are bound to divide our people. But, I am sure, the unity we are looking for is through respect which we require both ways. The small and the big must respect each other so that, we get united and work	together. If I may refer to what His Excellencythe Vice-President and Minister for Home Affairs said, he said that some people may be branding others anti-Nyayo. These kind of words should be avoided by leaders. He must know that we	are following one course and never try to divide us or our people.I am sure	that we are going to continue the registration of Kanu members. Let me say that this registration has been very slow, and we may wishto have the time allocated to it to be extended so that we may have more peoplebecoming members of the party. It is good that the party has been revitalisedto a great extent. It now has its own funds and more people have becomemembers. This is an effort for which we must, definite, praise our President.He has toured all our districts launching Harambee funds drives for kanu, andthe level of these funds is quite high now.	NWe wish our President a long and heal thy life because he has foughtto create unity and oneness among us. Those who try to divide us should neverbe allowed to succeed. I say so because once we are divided, the enemy willpenetrate us. So, we should work through Kanu and other Government machinery.As Parliament goes on recess, Government officers should continue to work hard.I know that most of these officers, have taken leave, but they should continueto do their jobs tirelessly and use the money that this Parliament has passedto see that it serves the necessary purposes for which it was voted.I request the Ministry of Transport and Communications to see thatour roads are widened to the extent they were in before. The Ministry's officersshould not continue to narrow them. A road that was once wide is now narrow, andit is difficult for us to use it. The supervisors of the maintenance of theseroads should be careful in order to see that when the roads are being graded,they are made wide enough.	Referring to the road that was mentioned by my neighbour, the hon. Memberfor Aldai, who is also the hon. Deputy Speaker, I would like to say that theroad is very important o It passes through my constituency. We want the Ministryof Transport and Communications to see that this road is improved all the wayfrom Majengo, through Seremi, Kaptumo and other areas to Nandi Hills. The road serves a very rich area, and the Ministry should help us to do business there by tarmacking that road. This will be a very big achievement.With those few remarks, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE (Mr. arap Saina): Thank you	very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to close theyear by congratulating all my colleague hon. Members of Parliament from whom I have had very nice and cordial co-operation both in and outside the House. Let me take this opportunity, therefore, to wish them a happy Christmas and a merry new year.I have a very few points to make. First of all, I would like to say that at this time of the year, some parts of our country have been experiencing a dry spell. During the year, we have experienced abnormal seasonal changes.   Some of these parts of the country are really facing food shortages. It is _  	surprising to note that after His Excellency the President has directed that       when farmers deliver their produce they should be paid immediately on a cash- on-delivery basis, a lot of farmers in the northern part of the Rift Valley who have delivered their produce, that is, beans and maize, are still waiting to be paid.</Newspeech>(Question put and agreed to)<Header>ADJOURNMENT</Header><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon. Members, that concludes the business on the Order Paper. The House is, therefore, adjourned sine die.</Newspeech>The House rose at thirty minutes past Six o'clock.
