What this means is ithat all shareholders in companies and cooperative farms that havebeen sub—divided by unlicensed surveyors cannot get their titledeeds In order to rectify this position, Mr. Speaker, Sir, both Government surveyors and private licensed land surveyors are already resurveying such farms so that the shareholders can get title deeds to their plots.(b) A list of all currently registered land surveyorshas already been despatched to all  district commissioners for their distribution to districts and divisions for easier reference by the land owners. Mr. Speaker, Sir, first of all I would like to thank the Minister very much for his reply. In. the third but paragraph of the reply by the Minister he says that Government surveyors and private licensed land surveyors are already resurveying such farms. Could the Minister point out areas where this is being done again? This is because there are several areas where farms were subdivided by unlicensed land surveyors. Could he pinpoint some areas where this is happening right now? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NYAKIAMO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to my information here, it is true that certain farms have been surveyed by unlicensed land surveyors and the Government has had to resurvey them. Most of these  farms in Laikipia West and Gatarakvra. The Government is already working on. these farms.MR. MATE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to his reply, the Minister says that there are some unlicensed surveyors who have done work which they are not supposed to do and that wananchi have lost money through ignorance. Could the Minister tell us what action the Government is taking to make sure that these wananchi are not cheated any more by these unlicensed surveyors? Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is the reason why the Questioner asked this Question. That is also the purpose of sending a list of all currently registered land surveyors to all district commissioners. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHTKUEU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I do not think the Minister replied to the supplementary question asked it by the hon. Member. That action has the Government taken against these unlicensed land surveyors? This is because they have committed a crime by sub—dividing farms when they knew very well that they are unlicensed. what action did the Minister take in this regard? This is because these people acted unlawfully. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NYAKTAMO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I said, in my reply, that the land owners whose farms were surveyed by these unlicensed land surveyors run the risk of not getting any title deeds. As a result of that we licensed private land surveyors and the list was sent to the distraction commissioners for their distribution to districts and divisions for easier reference by the land owners.This will enable our people to get information as to who to go to. So, I would have thought that that was the right action to have be taken by the Government. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>Mr MUTHORA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Let the Minister "be fair to the hon. Members in this House. These people have committed, a crime by doing a job they were not qualified to do. The hon. Member wants to know what action the Minister is going to take against these people who committed this crime. So, let him be fair to the hon. Member and the House, as a whole. He should tell this House what action he is intending to take against these people. These are thieves</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. NYAKIAMO: Hr. Speaker, Sir, I am as much concerned about this matter as anybody else. If the hon. Member wants to know whether these people have been arrested by the police, the truth is that they have not been arrested. I do not know whether this has now been done but I can check on it.MR. OMIDO, on behalf of Mr. Koske, asked the Minister for Labour:(a) whether he is aware that 39 employees of Chaimen Estate of Erooke Bond Limited in Eericho District are complaining that they were underpaid their leave allwance in 1385.(b) why they were underpaid; and(c) what action he is taking to ensure that the complainants are paid their dues. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MISITER FOR LABOUR Mr.Speaker, Sir, I "beg to reply.'(a) These employees have never reported their complaints to my Labour Office at Jericho, nowever, after receiving this (a) led out an investigation Question, I and I have established a that the complaint is not in relation to leave allowance for 1935." The rate of leave allowance which was applicable  in 1935 was KShs.l8.65 per day as specified in agreement signed in 1984. The problem which has led these employees to .complain arises from a misunderstanding over the interpretation of the agreement which was signed in December, 1936, two years later. This agreement was negotiated after Kenya had adopted a five day working week and, as such a higher rate of leave allowance at KShs.27.30 per day was stipulated. </Newspeech><Header>  THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LABOUR </Header>When Kenya reverted to a sixday working week early this year, the rate of leave allowance was reduced to Sh.2275 Per day. This consequential reduction of the rate and the amounts payable has apparently not been fully understood and appreciated by the workers of Cheimen Estate. The Union has, however, accepted they new rate because its downward adjustment was a logical consequence of having, reverted to a sixday working week.(b) In view of the answer in part (a) above, the workers in question were not underpaid in 1985 or thereafter.(c) My investigations indicate that these employees have misunderstood the interpretation of the Consequebtial adjustments which have had to be made in the 1986 agreement between their Union and the employees in so far as this relates to the payment of their leave allowance. The Union and theemployers in the other estates have encountered no problem in this regard. Under the circumstances, therefore, I would recommend that the employees of Cheimen Tea Estate be advised to see their Union for the necessary explanations.<Newspeech>MR. OMIDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the provisions of the Employment Act and the Wages Regulations Order, where an agreement entered into between the workers and the employers and the terms of that agreement are better than those provided in the General Wages Order, then the terms of the agreement takes precedence. Where the Union has negotiated what the terms other than those provided for in the Wages Regulation Order, then the wages order provisions takes precedence. In this case, it is clear that the collective bargaining agreement provided for a better leave allowance. Under what law did the Assistant Minister decide to reduce it and to accept what the employer had told him,it was contrary to the law? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. arep METTO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not think it is correct to say that there is contravention of the law here because if there was any, the Union which is representing the employees would have taken it up with us. But in this regard, the Union is agreeing with us on behalf of the employees and therefore, this does not arise. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OMIDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is the duty of the Ministry to ensure that the workers get a better share than that which is provided for. Why did the Ministry accept this when they knew that under the Collective Bargaining Agreement, it was provided that the workers receive Sh.2730 per day whereas the one that the Ministry proposed on their Wages Regulation Order provided for only Sh.2275? The Ministry knows that the provision of Sh.2775 per day should have taken precedencebecause that, was the agreement between the Union and the employer. MR. arap METTO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have explained the reason why it came to only Sh.2275 When we reverted to a sixday working week this figure came;., down. But I have said that where the Union and the employers agree, there is no way the Ministry or the Minister can intervene because in this particular regard, the Union on behalf of the employees have accepted and this is where I advised the Questioner to approach the employees and request them to ask their Union to explain this, to them. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SIIKUKU: Arising from that reply, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and taking into account that it is part of our responsibility in this House to safeguard the interests of the workers and vananchi in general, and due to the fact that it has now been raised by an hon. Members of this House that this Union and the employer were mistaken, would the Assistant Minister take it upon himself to correct this error? Unions are not God and, therefore, they can make mistakes. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. Arap METTO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to the information availableto me now, I do not see how I can take that responsibility, but if there is any particular law which has been broken, at this particular moment, I am not aware. However, if there has been any, then I will go and check and get the legal fellows to advise me on this and then I will take the necessary action. Otherwise, as far as I am aware, at this particular moment, there is  regulation which has been broken. As I have stated, tee Union should have taken up this matter with our labour officer and it would have come to our notice. </Newspeech>MR. OMIDO asked the Minister for Labour:(a)what kind of training MS Butaric Agencies of P.O. Box 19474, Hairobi, conducts for Trainee Estate Agents, and,(b) what facilities they have for such training and what the qualifications of their instructors are.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. arap Metto): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.My Ministry has carried out extensive investigations but has failed to establish what MS Butaric Agencies of P.O. Box 19474, Nairobi, does and whether it conducts any type of training. The agency is not registered by the Directorate of Industrial Training as a trainer or as a training heavy contributor Investigations to locate the physical address of this agency in the county havealso proved fruitless.MR. OMIDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, Sir, quite a number of people have approached me in my office and have shown me letters indicating that this alleged firm trains estate agents and that the agency collects a substantial amount of fees from these fellows after promising them that after training, they would find employment for them. However, these people do not get any form of training and they end up losing their money. I was wondering whether the Ministry would refer this matter to the police for investigation because the public are actually losing money. Mr. Speaker you will remember that I raised almost a similar question in this House two or three years ago and tie fellow was found to be operating from a private house in Langata and had collected a lot of money and the police were able to locate him found Assistant Minister undertake to Bake core extensive investigations because the public are actually losing a lot of money.MR. arap METTO: Mr. Speaker Sir, it is true that ny Ministry has taken steps to try to locate this company. In fact, I would like to say that initial search from the Registrar of Companies indicated that the owner of MS Butaric Agencies of P.O. Box 30041, Nairobi, which are commission agencies, is a Mr. Christopher Gitau. However, a subsequent search in the office of the Registrar of Companies h indicated that the company's file was lost. Information available from the records of the Ministry of Lands and Settlement indicate that the business is located on Plot Ifo.209695 Jivanjee Street,now lifangano Street, Kairobi. Physical search was carried out from door to doer and from floor to floor, but there was o evidence of the existence of such business in the building where the above plot is situated. Therefore Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think as was suggested by the hon. Member, the Questionwe may end up referringthis matter to the police for further investigations. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. MUTHURA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister seems to he in darkness. The hon. Members said that wananchi have been going to his office complaining and they have shown him documents to the effect that they have paid come money to this firm. I was wondering whether the hon. Member could assist the Assistant Minister to locate this place. If they knew where they paid the money, possibly, the hon. Member could assist  Assistant Minister in locating the place so that they can know where the firm is. I saying this because the Assistant Minister seems to be in darkness. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. 0MID0: Mr. Speaker, Sir, after receiving  some of these Complaints, I have tried to ask these fellows whether they could trace the fira, but the office where they paid the money no longer exists. As I said, this is a company which appears to be swindling the public of their money and think it is only the Government which can be in a position to locate the flask because they have the means to investigate the matter and protect the public interest</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. arap METTO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, my Ministry is very much concerned about this company in the sane way that the hon. Member and the House is concerned because members of the hppjlj r have been losing and I think as was suggested by the hon. Member, MR. SHIKUKU: You think you cannot get the fellows.MR. arap METTO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member is putting words into my mouth. What I am saying is that we are going to use, our office to see to it that investigate the natter either, even if it means referring it to the police SPEAKER: He shall move on now to Mr. Shikuku's Question. Question Ho.121 MR. BHIKUKU asked the Minister for Transport and Communications:(a) who authorized the lifting of the ban on the movement of lorries, trailers and other heavy trucks travelling between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m., and (b) whether he . 1 is aware that thi3 lift of the ban is the cause of many accidents on our roads and, if so, what he CB "king to ensure that the Carriage on the roads is minimised. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Keriri): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(a)The Government has authorized the lifting of the ban on the movement of lorries, trailers and other heavy trucks travelling between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m.(b)According to the available statistics, the lifting of the ban .is not the cause of the increased number of accidents on the roads. Accidents  involving  the heavy trucks are fewer than those involving cars and light utility vehicles. The Government has introduced the Traffic Amendment Act, 1986, which is intended to minimise the carnage on our roads, if fully complied with, by motorists and other road users. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SKIKUKU: Arising from that reply, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there must have been a re son why the Government banned the travelling of these heavy vehicles on our roads between that specific period. Assuming that there was a reason could the Assistant Minister tell the House why they lifted the ban? Is it because the situation had improved and, if so, by what percentage? MR. KERIRI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are always reasons for making decisions and also for rescinding them, his is not the first ban that has been lifted in this country. However, as I said, statistics do, in fact, indicate that the increase in the number of accidents was not necessarily caused by these heavy trucks on the roads, but by other things.For example, Mr. Speaker, before the tan, accidents increased annually by 11 per cent; between 1976 and 1979that is a range of four years. During the ban, accidents increased "by 14 per cent over the same period of time. This is an indication that even with the ban, the increase of accidents as higher than before the ban. Taking the other aspect of road transport into account, including the hauling of goods, this must have slowed down because there were no lorries travelling at night. So, the Government found that there was a reason for lifting the ban. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LUEZNB.O: Would the Assistant Minister tell this House r whether it is correct to say that this ban was lifted only by the pressure from the. lorry owners but not due to decrease in the number of accidents? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KERIRI: I am not aware of that, Mr. Speaker. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKHKIJ: Arising from the reply which he gave to my previous supplementary question as to what was the reason for banning the vehicles from using, the roads and then later lifting the ban will he tell this House why in the first place they banned the movement of heavy vehicles and the reason for lifting the ban? He has not told the House that. They was the ban imposed he the first place and why was the ban lifted in the second place? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KERIRI: Mr If Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member knows very well that his Question is based on the reasons why the ban was imposed It was imposed as an effort to reduce accidents at night; a fact which he knows and that is why he asked the Question. Nov, after some time it was found out that, in fact, srhilei.this bam was hurting the economy it was not infact, reducing the accidents. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTHURA: If I remember very well, when the late hon. Leonard G. Ngala was the Minister for transport and Communications, he complained about these accidents and after travelling at night from Nakuru to Nairobi, he imposed a ban on this night movement of heavy vehicles but later on it was lifted. So, when the ban was placed once again, there must have been a better reason for that action. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTKURA (CTD): Is the Assistant Minister telling the House and the nation that the situation improved so much that the "ban had to "be lifted. This is; the second, time after 1971</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR, KERIRI? Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not saying that the situation had improved so much. All I am saying is that the ban did not, in fact, achieve its purpose, "but it continued to hurt the economy. So, I am not saying that the situation improved so much; .there was nothing like that. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MATHENGE: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. </Newspeech><Newspeech>SPEAKER: Order Let us make sure that it is a real point order.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MATHENGE: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister in order to mislead the House? The Question inquires him to tell us k about the number of accidents caused by the heavy vehicles during the night. In his reply, he talked about the economy being boosted by those lorries. Is he in order to mislead this House? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR .SPEAKER: That was a part of the reply that was given I think you had better try very hard to raise a real point of order, and not a Supplementary Question MR MUTISO, Sir, arising from the answer given by the Assistant Minister to the effect that it was discovered that banning these vehicles from travelling at night was hurting the country's economy, is he telling the House that before this consideration was thought of, the Ministry had not carried out a proper survey to know exactly whether banning night travel by these vehicles would hurt the economy or not, or was this a result of some pressure applied by those who own these vehicles? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR KERIRI: Mr Speaker, Sir, as all hon. Members are aware (Noise) if only they could listen to the answer to this Supplementary Question, our planning is based on pragmatic thinking,, At one stage, one factor weighs more heavily on us than another The factor of life must weight more than all the others<> At that time, the Government thought that night travel by heavy trucks was the cause of most road accidents0 We also had to put some .consideration to the economic contribution made by these trucks, but we thought we would do better by banning them from night travel in order to save lives9 even if the economy was going to suffer,. After some years, however, it was found out that the rate of accidents was still increasing,. All these accidents could not necessarily have been caused "try these heavy vehicles. In fact, more accidents occur during the day than is the case at night So, this is no reason why we should continue banning these vehicles from travelling at night when we know that we are hurting our economy and not saving lives,, </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KERIRI SO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister tell the House which are the majority between the accidents taking place at night and those occuring during the day? </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR KERIRI: Before I sat down, Mr0 Speaker, Sir, I said  that the accidents occurring during the day are more than those taking place at night</Newspeech>Question No.601<Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Is Mr. wakiondo not here? We will leave his Question until the end. </Newspeech>Question No. 580 MR. MUNYAO asked the Minister for Education:(a) whether he is aware that the original certificates for Ordinary and Advanced level examinations take unnecessarily too long to come out after the examination results are out; and(b)  whether he will assure this House that such certificates will be released to students along with r examination results.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr Kisiero): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(a) I am aware that the original certificates for the Ordinary and Advanced level examinations are issued one year after the release of examination results because the logistics involved will not allow for the issue of these certificates with the results. Furthermore, after the release of results, there follows a period for receiving enquiries from candidates and then making necessary corrections My Ministry, through the Kenya National Examinations Council, needs ample time to settle all such enquiries so that the issue of the certificates is final0(b) I wish to assure the House that during this period, candidates are not inconvenienced because they are given result slips to present to prospective employers or institutions of higher learning. My Ministry, through the Kenya National Examinations Council, also issues certifying statements to employers and institutions in respect of any student .on request. Under these circumstances, therefore, my Ministry does not plan to issue certificates at the time results are released as the current system is working wello</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. MUNYAO: Mr Speaker, Sir, I am surprised that the Ministry needs a year to correct errors. In View Of  the reply given by the Assistant Minister, is he aware that there are some institutions which do not accept result slips and that, therefore, this inconveniences students? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR KISIERO MR. Speaker, Sir, I am not aware that there are any institutions which would insist that students must get original certificates. All these institutions are a part of our Government, and they know very well that in case a student cannot make available a result slip, they can always get in touch with the Kenya National. Examinations Councilor our Ministry, after which we will certify that suchandsuch a student obtaining such and such marks So, I would be surprised to hear that there are any such institutions as the hon. Member refers to </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUHYAO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the Assistant Minister aware that if a student wants to pursua overseas education, some colleges and universities need examination transcripts, and not result slips? That kind of requirement would not be satisfied by a mere result slip </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KISIERO: Mr Speaker, Sir, as I said earlier, there would be no way of giving students original certificates immediately examination results are released, but if such students are "being offered places overseas, most of the institutions admitting them are associated in one way or another with our Ministry of Education or the Kenya National Examinations Council, which is recognised in many countries, particularly in the Commonwealth  So, such overseas institutions should be able to get in touch with us, and we certify a candidate's pass </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR KIRIQR: Mr Speaker, Sir, may I know what period is given by the Kenya National Examination Council for receiving complaints from candidates making andthe necessary corrections? </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. KISIERO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Council takes about one year to remark examinations where there have been complaints and for the Security Committee of the Kenya National Examinations Council to check the new marks obtained after remarking. Once we have known the exact figure of the students who have passed and made all the necessary correction of names, we print certificates in Britain We have to print the exact number of certificates required so that when they come here they are neither in excess short. We need about one year to carry out this exercise</Newspeech>Question No 616MR. MUTISO asked the Minister for Water Development:(a)  why the employees of survey teams under the Machakos? Integrated Development Programme (M.I.D.P) are not paid field disturbance allowances; and(b) whether he can direct that these teams now doing survey work in Yatta, Kibauni and Machakos Town be paid these allowances <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR WATER DEVELOPMENT (Mr„ Mwendwa): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply(a) The employees of survey teams under the M.I.D.P. are paid field disturbance allowances every three months It has been found More practical and convenient to pay these allowances every three months(b)The allowances for the teams now working in Yatta, Kibauni and Machakos Town have already been paid. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTISO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while agreeing with the reply he has given to part (a) of the Question, could   be more specific about part (b) and tell the House when they were paid, how many they were and how much money they were paid. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWENDWA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not have the figures for the number involved for the amount of money paid as allowances, but they were paid on the 28th September, and3rd October. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUNYAO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I agree with the statement just given by the Minister, but, as far as I know disturbance allowance is usually paid monthly. Is this the same disturbance allowance that is being after three months or which disturbance allowance is he talking about? </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. MWENDWA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is disturbance allowance paid when one moves from one station to another, but that is given once after so many years. 'But, these are field officers who move from one place to another in shorter periods and, thus, this is what is called disturbance. It is not possible to pay for the day after they move because you have to go and look for them to find out where they are in order to pay them. So, that is why it is easier to pay them after every three months after collecting the relevant data. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTISO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I still feel that the Minister is not being fair. He should be in a position to tell the House how much money was paid to these workers. This is because he cannot simply say that they were paid. He must have "more information on that. Do we have to accept that they were paid and yet we are not shown any evidence at all? What evidence has he got to prove that they have been paid? </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. MUNYAVO Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe my officers in the field and when they tell me that they have done something, regard that as good evidence for whatever I wanted to know. If have the information he is asking for. I Have already saidI have already said that I do not have the information on how much they were paid and the number of workers that was involved. But, if ho, particularly wants that information, then I could always let him have it. </Newspeech>Question No. 548MR. SIFUNA asked the Minister for Water Development(a)  whether he could provide borehole water through Kefinco to Kabula SecondarSchoiy. Bulondo Health Centre, Sangalo Secondarj School, Chief's Centre at Kitale, Manyanja.Market, Mechineru Dispensary, Siritanyi School, Siekumulo School and Lwanda Secondary School and(b) whether he is aware that institutions in these areas and the people are having water problems and if so, what action he is taking to assist them.<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR WATER DEVELOPEMENT (Mr. Mwendwa): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply..(a) Manyanja Market and Siritanyi School have already been provided with boreholes and hand pumps. Siekumulo School has been provided with a protected spring. The other places, that is, Kabula Secondary School, Bulondo Health Centre, Sangalo Secondary School, the Chief1s Centre at Kitale, Lwanda Secondary School and Machimeru Dispensary are outside the area covered by the agreement between Kenya and Finland, consequently, KEFINCO is not in a position to provide them with borehole water. However, this area will be covered under the .Buggoma Rural Water Supply Scheme which is now at the tendering stage.(b)The Minister is aware that the institutions referred to and the people of the area are having vater problems and that is why Buhgoma Rural Water Supply Sheme has been designed. It is expected that once this project is completed, the water problems of the area inquestion will be solved. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SIFUNA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am surprised to get that answer from my hon. friend. We do not have borehole water at Siritanyi School. We have it at Siritanyi Market which is over 10 kilometres from the School. That is why I asked specifically water for Siritanyi Primary School, and not the Market. Secondly, the protected spring at Siekumulo School is nonexistent. Could the hon. Minister tell us which protected spring & referring to at Siekumulo School  because there is nothing of that sort? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWENDWA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the information I have here is that Siekumulo School has a protected spring provided. I have not got the local name. Again, if the Questioner would prefer me to call it by the local name, I will find out and; let him know. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SIFUNA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to inform my hon. friend that there is nothing like a protected spring at Siekumulo School. I would like the Minister to go and get a proper. answer and maybe give us borehole water at this particular place. I remember in 1981 and let the Minister be very careful about this matter there was this Bungoma Rural Water Scheme which vas advertised and tendered for in the local dailies and as well as in the Weekly Review. It is now seven years since the so called Bungoma Rural Water Scheme was advertised, but nothing up to now has taken place. What is he telling us now by saying that it is under tendering stage when they did so in 1981? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWENDWA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am saying that the tenders are being considered. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SIFUNA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I wonder whether the Minister is very serious about this matter? I have just told him that in 1981 the Minister for Water Development tendered for this Bungoma Rural Water Scheme. Now, he is telling us again that it is under tendering stage. How many tendering stages do we have if they advertised this tender in 1981? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWENDWA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the information I have is that the scheme is under tendering stage. MR< SPEAKER: We go back to Mr. Mwachofi's Question. MR. MV.ACIICFI: Ew.

MWACHOFI: Bw. Spika, jawabu la Waziri Msaidizi, nafikiri, hata yeye mwenyewe akikubaliana nami, ni'la kusikitisha sana. Swali hili si Swali Maalum. Wizara imekuwa nalo kwa miezi minne sasa, na maelezo yote kuhusu Swali lenyewe katika sehemu ya (a) na (b)ft ni kwa nini analipotosha Bunge hili kwamba hana habari? Itakuwaje amuulize hujoi mwananchi mtukufu kwamba aende polisi Kamukunji, na hali katika sehemu ya (a) ya Swali hili inaonyesha wazi kwamba alipiga ripoti huko tarehe 23.2.87? Sasa ataenda kupiga.ripoti ya kuwashtaki polisi au ataenda kupiga ripoti ya kumshtaki nani? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KUBAI: Bw. Spika, kulingana na ripot.i tuliyoipata kuhusuItCuO (' o fczt? uJSwali hili r.i kwamba hakuna ripotina kituo cha polisicha Kamukunji kutoka kwa Bwc Mathew Mhindoo kwamba tarelie 23.2.87alikuwa ameupoteza mfuko wake katika gari la abiria KWP 051. Hatahaijulikani hiyo kesi nambari 112 ya 1987 ya polisi kama ilivyotajwa iii'JCo VOojalitoa wazi kwani hakuna rekodi hiyo katika kituo cha polisx cha Kamukunjie Ikiwa ni kweli kwamba Bw. Mathew Mhindoo aliupoteza mfuko wake anashauriwa ayapeleke maelezo hayo katika kituo cha polisi cha Kamukunji au kituo kingine chochote cha polisi. Zaidi ya hayo, hakuna mwananchi yeyote anayekatazwa kupiga ripoti katika kituo cha polisi wakati amepoteza mali yake. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWACHOFI: Bw. Spika, inakuwa vigumu kujua nitamwambiaje Waziri Msaidizi kwa sababu huyo mwananchi anasema hivi katika barua yake:"Nilienda Kamukunji Polisi Station kuandikisha statement baada ya kuwajulisha polisi. Wakaniambia nirudi asubuhi. Niliporudi huko nilipewa polisi wawili tukaenda Nyamakima. Tulipokuwa. njiani hiyo wakaniambia nitoe 'chai'. Nikakataa. Tulipofika kwenye ofisi ya Nunguni Bus, polisi waliingia ndani. Wakaongea na meneja. Wakapewa pesa. Wakaniambia tuende kwa sab'abu kondakta ametumwa kuutafuta mfuko. Ikawa sasa wakaniambia niwe<. nikienda kupiga ripoti kwa polisi station crime office No.8, second floor. Nikaenda kila wiki, na.baadaye Inspekta akaniambia — Waliniambia, 'Mambo yako hatutaki. Wakanifukuza nisifike tena kwa hiyo polisi station".Sasa ikiwa hali ni hiyo, Bw. Spika, |ananohi aanafanywa hivyo, na sasa anaambiwa aende kituo hicho hicho cha polisi, swali ambalo namuuliza Waziri Msaidizi ni kwamba ataenda huko kuomba msaada kwa nani kama wale ambao walikuwa wakimsaidia ndio walimfukuza? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

Jambo langu la nidhamu linahusu Swali hili. Mhe Waziriri Msaidizi, Bw. Kubai, ameseina ukweli ule anaoufahan.u. Kwa kawaida kama kuna Swali ni juu ya Ifizara kuuliza kituo kinaehohusika kuipatia majibu Kwa vile sasa ni wazi kwamba maofisa wa polisi wenyewe walihusika katika vitendo 'vichafu, trie Waziri Msaidizi hangeveza kupata ukweli huu anacpev:a.

Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I ask my Question by PrivateNotice, and the AttorneyGeneral replies, may I make a correction. There is onlyOne AbuyaAbuya in the whole of the Republic of Kenya. The reply I have received from the AttorneyGeneral ,which is taking about the late AbuyaAbuya </Newspeech><Newspeech>HON.MEMBERS: It is late AbugaAbuga</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. ABUYAABUYA: If he looks at the name in the Question, he will see that it is completely different. I am not yet late.Mr. Speaker, Sir I beg to ask the AttorneyGeneral the following Question 37 Private Notice.(a) Is the AttorneyGeneral aware that the family of the late Abuga Abuga,Administration Cause Ho. 285 of 1985 had applied to the Public Trustee to have themoney deposited with Barclays Bank Kisii, by the late Abuga, paid to them?(a) Since all information regarding the above has been supplied, will he now pay this family without further delay? </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTORNEYGENEILAL(Mr. Kuli): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must apologise forthe typing error. I hope this sort of type graphical error did not cause a lot of embarra¬ssment to the hon. Member. The deceased that we are talking about is the late Abuga Abuga, and not AbuyaAbuy a. So, that mistake should be corrected immediately to read Abuga Abuga and not AbuyaAbtya. .How, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(a) I am aware that the Public Trustee has Received funds due to the estate of the late Abuga Abuga from the account with Barclays Bank of Kenya at Kisii. Nonetheless, the said tunds cannot, now, be released to the deceased S family as the same is subject to certain statutory and administration charges plus other outstaning legal formalities pertaining to the deceased land Ref. No East Kitutu Kebirichi165.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to refute the suggestion or idea that all particulars regarding this case have been received by the Public Trustee because the Public Trustee has, on several occasions, written to one of the widows demand¬ing all the land certificates to enable him proceed with the transfer of the said immovable property. However, all these efforts have been without success. I will appeal to the hon. Member for Kitutu East, through the Chair, and the District Commissioner, Kisii, to try and assist us by providing  the land certificates and other particulars to enable this estate be brought to immediate conclusion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ABUYAABUYA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while agreeing with the Attorney General that the information he requires has not been forwarded, the matters pertaining to this case are being handled by the District Commissioner, Kisii, and I have looked at the file in the district commissioners office and I have not seen any letter from the S AttorneyGenerals Office asking for these particulars. If any letters have been written to that effect, could the Attorney General lay copies of those letters on the Table? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MULI: Kr Speaker, Sir, I have letters here addressed to Mrs. Teresia M. Abuga starting from 29th September, 1986. The one of that date, in part, says:“Could you please send land certificates of the said immovable property to me at your earliest?”The one dated 2nd February, says in part:“I refer to my letter Ref I regret youhave not sent me these certificates. Your quick response to this matter shall be highly appreciated.”The other one dated 11th May, in part, says“I would appreciate the land certificates to enable transfer of this property”.Mr. Speaker, Sir, since I have done my best, could the hon. Membertry to kick the ball from that side and then I will be able to assist? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ABUYAABUYA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, could the AttorneyGeneral then try to consider releasing the money which, at the moment, has nothing to do withthe land so that the late Mr. Abuga's family could utilise it for paying school fees while he deals with the immovable property? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MULI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have explained, the law of the Public Trustee. Incidentally, that Department is being reorganised to be called AdministratorGeneral, where the Public Trustee's Section will be. Now the Public Trustee does not deal with matters of this nature  piecemeal; his first duty is to assemble the estate of a deceased person. When he has done that, he then gets the letters of administration of the whole estate. On obtain¬ing the letters of administration from a court, then the Public Trustee is able, by law, to distribute the estate including immovable properly just like in this case. All that I can do is that if the family of the late Mr. Abuga has some financial problems and they make an application to the Public Trustee for a modest sum, a reasonable sum can be advanced to them. I would be quite pleased to advance some money but not to release the whole estate. </Newspeech><Header>  POINTS OF ORDER </Header><Newspeech>MR. SIFUNA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. In April this year, there was a Question raised in this House in connexion with the Ministry of Water Development about a Mr. Savi who is working with the Ministry and who had not been paid his salary from 1981 to 1985. The Minister for Water Development promised this House that Mr. Savi would be paid all his dues. In June this year, the Minister wrote a letter to the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Water Develop¬ment, asking him to speed up the process of paying Mr. Savi but, up to now, the said employee has not been paid his dues. Could the hon. Minister make a Ministerial c Statement and tell the House when Mr. Savi will be paid his dues? </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR WATER DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Mwendwa): Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is not possible for me to say, at this point in time, when Mr. Savi will be paid his dues. However, if the hon. Member gives me time, I will be able to let him know sometimes next week. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. It is becoming a habit in this House for Ministers net to respond to the matters we raise here immediately, Whether that is deliberate or no, I do not know. However, I am worried about the dignity and honourability of this House as far as the FrontBench is concerned. We are soon losing the trend of affairs in the House.Mr. Speaker, Sir, on 7th October, 1987 I listed statements which were required to be made here by Ministers, starting with the AttorneyGeneral and other Ministries. Up to now, I have not seen any Minister coming up to make any such statements which they promised the House to make. You can now see that this issue has been raised by hon. Sifuna and the Minister for Water Development is saying that he is going to have a look at it. Now, for how long can we tolerate this state of affairs? It is either we behave honourably in this House or we are no longer hon. Members of Parliament, particularly the FrontBench. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Matiba): ON a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I guess that the hon. Member includes the Ministry of Health</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: No, I do not. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Matiba): Oh, he does not. Thank you. I must appreciate that.Mr. Speaker, Sir, on Wednesday, 14th October, 1987 the hon. Member forButere, Mr. Shikuku, raised a matter concerning procurement of drugs in thisHouse and made a number of allegations regarding the purchase and requisition ofthe same by my Ministry. He accused a senior member of my Ministry staff of almost corrupt practices in the matter of the intended purchase of drugs. Following that, my Assistant Minister who was in the House promised that I was going to make a statement to the House this week. I was on a tour of Nyanza Province, and I only returned to Nairobi over the weekend. I had hoped that I was going to make a state¬ment to the House this morning but, unfortunately, I was not able to get myself ready because there are a number of points I an investigating which are very serious  and about which I must be clear in my own mind when making a statement in thisHouse. I do not want to leave this House in any doubt as to exactly what ishappening. For the time being, I can assure the House that no drugs have been acquired as yet and, therefore, nobody has been awarded the tender to supply drugs to the Ministry of Health. I am investigating the matter to see how far some of the allegations go and then I will decide accordingly.I intend to make the statement on Thursday next week because, by that time, I will have had all the details that I want. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: On a point; of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. May I correct one point the hon. Minister has said, that I accused s a senior member of his staff of funny dealings inthe purchase of drugs. I only referred to the senior officer'sletter of extension of the tender but not purchasing. If he goes with that in mind, it might help him to do a good homework so that he comes and tells us. Secondly, when the Minister comes to reply to this House, I would like him to deny or accept whether he did not receive any letter from the AttorneyGeneral and the Criminal Investigation Department to the effect that this Indian Shailesh Patel the middle name is very hard to pronounce  should not even tender for the Ministry. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. Matiba): Mr. Speaker, Sir, as can be expected, that will be part and parcel of the statement that I will make when I come here on Thursday next week. As faras the point regarding the senior executive of my Ministryis concerned, namely, the Director of Medical Services, the hon. Member here might not have made that specific allegation. However, impressions created in the Press were very bad. In fact, the headlines in one of our daily newspapers were "Director of Medical Services named in a Drugs Scandal". That was the headline. So my statement is not without foundation. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.SPEAKER: Next order. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ABUYA ABUYA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.With your permission, I would like the Minister for Transport andCommunications to make a statement to clear some allegations that the road under construction between Chemosit and Kisii, whose contract, has been terminated has moved to site to acquire</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ABUYA ABUYA (CTD.):equipment worth millions of shillings without the decision of the Government, and that a section of his Ministry is in favour of this and, as a result the Government will lose a lot of money. If that is the case, we would like to have a statement from the Ministry of Transport and Communications to the effect that there will be no favouritism. He should assure the Housethat there are no officers who are in favour of this contractor to acquire the equipment worth millions of shillings. On top of that there are allegations that he will be paid a sume of 5 about Shs.70 million, therefore deflating the whole amount of the contract which is Shs.146 million. We would like to have a clear statement from the Ministry of Transport and Communications regarding this issue. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.SPEAKER: Let us move on to the next order</Newspeech><Header>  MOTIONS </Header>THAT, considering the fact that Kenyans are free to live, work and settle in any district of their choice within the Republic of Kenya irrespective of their districts of origin; this House urges the Government to allow wananchi to obtain the national identity cards wherever they are within the country without requiring them to obtain prior clearance from the Provincial Administration (i.e. Chiefs) & of their original Districts.(Mr. Mwaruwa on 14.10.87)(Resumption of Debate interrupted on 14.10.87) MR. ANYUMBA: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sirfor giving me this opportunity.Mr. Speaker, Sir, unfortunately, I stand to oppose this Motion very, very much because there are a number of reasons for opposing it.<Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: You have been bribed</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ANYUMBA: I have not been bribed because none of us takes a bribe. One opposes or supports a Motion on basis of principle, and I will oppose it on these grounds.One, the possession of the national identity card of Kenya implies that the holder is a Kenya citizen. Secondly, it also implies that the holder can go forward and register as a voter in Kenya.Thirdly, Kr. Speaker, Sir, it goes on to imply that the holder ofthe identity card can get a job and work in Kenya because he is a Kenyacitizen. These axe three straighforward conditions. We know that the demandfor our national identity card is great particularly from nationals ofneighbouring countries. These people would like to come and work in Kenyaor enjoy the peace and liberty prevailing in Kenya while pretenting to be Kenya citizens. These people are, therefore, working hard day and night trying to get the national identity cards. If the police investigate, they will find out that these people are Kenya citizens illegally.We can recollect, Sir,that our law courts have been busy prosecuting a number of nonKenya citizens who have been in possession of our national identity cards illegally. This has been going on and I have no doubt that the Hover of the Motion can remember what has been going on around Ngong area apart from other cases which he must obviously have read in the Press. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWARUWA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I am not aware of what the hon. Member is alleging. Could he substantiate who happened' to be a nonKenya citizen and was issued with an identity card? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ANYUMBA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all read newspapers. This instances have been going on since identity cards started to be issued with a view of acquiring the voters cards. There was a report in the news¬papers on how a member of the provincial administration had been issuing identity cards to nonKenya citizens in the Ngong area. All that was contained in the newspapers. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.MWARUWA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I would like to inform the hon. Member that we are not working through the Press and this House does not on the strength of what is contained in the newspapers. He has alleged that there are some people who are not Kenya citizens but wereissued with identity cards. I would like him to substantiate this and give the names of those people and when that took place. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ANYUMBA: Although I am not going to withdraw that, I would like to ask the Speaker to give me a little time so that I can go to the library hereand extract that report from the newspapers. I am sure the hon. Member readthat story although he is denying Mr. Speaker, Sir, as said earlier and I do not want to repeat </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWARUWA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.SPEAKER: Order Sometimes, Mr. Mwaruva you are interrupting without grounds. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ANYUMBA: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The hon. Member is making ms repeat myself at times. With your permission, Sir, I would like to emphasize three more points so that it can go on record why I am opposing the Motion. First of all, I said that the possession of our national identity card implies that the holder is a Kenya citizen; secondly, the holder can proceed and register himself to vote during Parliamentary and civic elections thirdly, he can work in Kenya as a Kenya citizen. This is because the identity card shows that he is a Kenya citizen. These advantages should be made available to Kenyans alone and not to nonKenyans.We know people, particularly from our neighbouring countries, havebeen pursuing the possession of Kenyan identity cards so that ,they can be able to enjoy the peace and tranquillity we have here and even work amongstour people. It is, therefore, important to ensure that any person who isissued with a Kenyan identity card, is a Kenya citizen or else, we are goingto have foreigners in this country pretending to be Kenyans. This matter doesnot end there but will also touch on matters of security. If there is laxityin the issuing of identity cards, we can also have agents of hostile  governmentspretending to be innocent citizens and be issued with identity cards. Theonly way by which we can ensure that we are issuing our identity cards toKenya citizens is to make sure that the man we are identifying to be issued.with an identity card, is known by the local administration. This must goright down to his home district; he must be identified by his chief and assis¬tant chief.The Mover of the Motion mentioned that he exercise becomes when chiefs have to consulted. That is another matter all together. The exercise can be hastened. I know that when the Government started registering voters, the exercise was slow but due to the pressure we had put on the Ministry concerned, they were able to mate available more and more registration units which hastened the exercise very much. The exercise can be hastened as opposed to merely issuing identity cards to anybody who may wish to obtain it anywhere in Kenya.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I completely oppose the Motion and insist that we identify each and every person by saying he is a Kenyan and then issue him with an identity card. With these few remarks, Sir, I beg to : oppose the Motion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES (Mrs. Ogot): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I stand to oppose the Motion that people should be issued with identity cards regardless of where they come from in the country.The reasons are simple. First of all, it is a fact that Kenyans can work wherever they wish starting from Mombasa to Busia; eastern and western. This is only possible when the identity of the person has been ascertained that he is a Kenyan. We have just been going through the rigorous exercise of issuing identity cards to both men and women. The procedure laid down by the Government has enabled young Kenyans to get their identity cards very quickly. This is because, where there has been doubt, I am giving the example of Yala Division of a young married woman or a young person who has been living with his parents in the city, the chiefs  and assistant chiefs have been able to quickly identify the boys and girls. This also applies to those who have lost their identity cards. Identification of these people has been very easy through the local administration. This is very, important because issuing of identity cards and thus making people Kenya citizens would be very dangerous because  anybody can cross the border on foot or otherwise to acquire an identity card if nobody questions him. One could go ahead and register many nonKenyans to the detriment of ourpeople. This is not only on the job issue; but also on the security of the nation. The Mover of the Motion might have had good intentions but what benefit would it give Kenyans to have so many young people from other countries crossing the border and registering as Kenyans? would it not infringe on the rights of Kenyans both his sons and daughters as well as mine? </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICE'S (Mrs. Ogot) I, therefore, feel that since the procedure has been moving on very smoothly in all parts of Kenya and to have enabled us to register over six million people in a very short time, there would not "be any need to take a short cut on this issue.The second point is that I would like to say a word of thanks to the Provincial Administration for having cooperated with the KANU officials and speeded up the issuing of identity cards. This has happened everywhere, including the area which hon. Mwaruwa represents. As regards that issue, there has not been any handicap or delay apart from the fact that there have "been a few complaints from some areas that some assistant chiefs and chiefs were probably trying to ask for little amounts of money before these forms were signed. By and large, the exercise was done speedily and in very good spirit and cooperation between the people, the Government, and KANU. With those few remarks, I beg to oppose the Motion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR COMMERCE (Mr. Lalampaa): Ahsante sana Bw. Spika kwa kunipa nafasi hii, ili pia niseme machache juu ya Hoja liii.Ninasimama kuipinga Ho ja hii kwa sababu ni hatari kwa usalama wa nchi hii. "It can be a security risk", ikiwa tuta ipitisha Hoja hii. Sababu ya kwanza ni hii: Mgeni akitoka nchi jirani, navkuelekea Mombasa na kuwaambia wale maofisa wanaoto a. vitambulisho kwamba anatoka Busia, Kakamega, Kisumu, Samburu, Embu, au Kirinyaga itakuwa vigumu sana kwa maofisa kumjua huyu mgeni bila kupitia kwa chifu au chifu msaidizi ili waweze kujua kama huyu mtu angestahili kupatiwa kitambulisho. Ikiwa Hoja hii itapitishwa, wageni wengi watajiandikisha kama Wanakenya bila ruhusa cha Serikali na watu wa Kenya. Jambo kama hilo linawesa kuwa hatari sana, kwa sababu hata unaweza kuandikisha wapelelezi leutoka nchi za nje. Watu kama hawaanaweza kuchukua vitambulishokisha wakaianya upelelezi katika nchi hii. Kwa hivyo, Hoja hii ni hatari sana kwa usalama wa nchi hii.Mud a mrefu hupotezwa wakati rawananchi anapoambiwa aende achukue kitainbulisho raahali ambapo alisaliwa. Kileambacho Serikali inahitaji ni thibitisho kutoka lava chifuau chifu msaidizi. ambaye anamjua yule mwananchi. Chifu ndiyeanaweza kusema, "Fulani wa Fulani ni mzaliwa wa sehemu fulanikatika tarafa fulani, katika wilaya fulani". Baada ya'thibitisho kutoka kwa chifu au chifu msaidizi mwananchi huyoanaweza kupewa kitaaibulisho cha Jamhuri ya Kenya. Jambo hiliili tusje tukafanya makosa ya kuandikisha wageni ambao baadayewanaweza kuwa hatari kwa usalama kwa taifa la Kenya.Bw. Spika, ningependa kuwaomba Waheshimiwa Wabungewengine waipinge HOja. hii kwa sababu itahatarisha usalama wawananchi wa Kenya. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAKUWA: How</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR COMMERCE (Mr. lalampaa) BW. Spika, Mhe. Mwaruwa ananiuliza 'how'. Ml.nil sitakikuyarudiaf niliyoongea kwa sababu ni kinyume s cha Kanuni za Nimesema kwamba. Ho ja hii ikipitishwa, itakuwa hat ax i kwa usalama wa nchi hii.Bw. Spika, ingefaa vitambulisho vya Kenya viwe vikipewawananchi wa Kenya peke yao na siowageni. Kama kuna mgeni yeyote anayetaka kuwa Mwanakenya, basi sheria iko wazi; njia ya kujiandi kisha iko wazi. Mtu kama huyo anatakiwa atume maombi yake kwa Serikali na yatafikiriwa. Kama mtu huyo amekuwa k&feka nchir «ye£enya kwa muda mrefu akiwa mgeni, na kuna sababu ya kumfanya asitake kutoka humu nchini, kuna sheria inayomruhusu mtu kama huyo kutuma maombi yake kwa Serikali ili 5 apewe kitambulisho cha Kenya. Lakini, haifajjii mgeni yeyote kutoka nchi peysHrektipewa kitambulishd mara tu aingiapo Kenya. Ikiwa hivyo, .wageni wengi watapewa vitambulisho vya Kenya na huenda wakachukua nafasi za kazi ambazo zingekuwa za watu wa Kenya. Vile vile, jambo hilo laweza kufanya idadi ya watu katika nchi hii kuongezeka. Kwa hayo machache naipinga Hoja hii. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTISO: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Let mealso join my colleagues in opposing this Motion because it isan unfortunate one .The Mover of this Motion usually bringsvery good Motions into this House and we wholeheartedly supporthim. But this time, I will not support him. national.A national identity card is a very important document because it gives the holder all the constitutional rights of that nation. In fact, even when one is applying for a passport, he is first of all asked to produce his identity card. In the identity card, it is indicated clearly where one was born and other details. Our system of Government is so good in ensuring that it does not let into the country people who come in camouflaged in one wayor another who would end up becoming spies, saboteurs, agents of imperialism and all other kinds of agents. It is difficult, to tell the origin of a person by merely looking at him his colour does not mean very much as far as a person's origin is concerned. For instance, you might not tell the difference between the Asians who were born in Mombasa or the Waswahili. It might be difficult for you to tell whether that person isa Kenyan citizen Unless you have</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Could the hon.

Member should not ask me to substantiate the obvious. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWARUWA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. MUTISO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, would you please protect me from these hon. Members? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWARUWA: On a point, of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I come from the Coast and I am not very black. I speak Kiswahili but I am not a Mswahili. Could the hon. Member substantiate andtell us who the Waswahili arc? We would like to know that. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTISO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was doing exactly what the hon. Member is asking me to do. I said that the people who use Kiswahili as their normal daily language of communication and who do not have a black skin are the people we Know as the Waswahili from the Coast. If the hon. Member holds  different view,, that is a matter of opinion.What I want to say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that our system of Government is so good that it is organized in such a way that </Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. SHIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.I am sorry to take my hon. friend's time. He is talking aboutthe Waswahili, but the Mover, when he was moving this Motion,said that there is some sort of discrimination against those withblack skins, but those with a brown colour are not asked about their ancestry; </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTISO: Mr. Speaker,  Sir, I just gave an example of the people from the Coast. I am now coming to the black people. It would be equally difficult to tell the difference between person from Bungoma or some other part of Western Kenya at the boundary, who speaks Luhya or Bukusu, and those people living across the Boundary in Uganda. It is not easy to tell whether such a person is a Kenyan or a Ugandan. We, therefore, needa system by which we should ensure that we issue identity cards only to Kenyans. We have such a system whereby we have provincial commissioners heading provinces, district commissioners heading districts, district officers heading divisions, chiefs heading locations and even assistant chiefs heading sublocations. All these positions are held by Government officers. This goes right down to the village, to facilitate the identification of individuals. For example, if I went to my chief, he would say, "This is Gideon Munyao Mutiso who was born in this location, and we know his parents." There, therefore, cannot be any question of somebody trying to camouflage his origin in order to get and Kenyan identity card. Some pi people, from forigncountries, have been issued with identity cards only to be discovered much later when the damage has been done. Some people only use passports they do not have identity cards. We have heard of spies who only got discovered after they had caused a lot of damage. We do not want that kind of thing to happen to Kenya. I, therefore,  fully support the idea of issuing identity cards to those  people who have been identified from the villages from which they claim to have come from and up to the district commissioner or the provincial commissioner. With that kind of system, our nation shall remain free from infiltration by saboteurs, agents and that kind of people.Mr.Speaker, Sir, I feel that this Motion has been a very unfortunate one and it would to be opposed vehemently. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MS. MATE: Kr. Speaker, Sir, I also stand to oppose this Motion very strongly. The meaning of having an identity card, is to be able to be identified and if someone cannot be identified, then he should not be given an identity card because he has not been identified.Sir, as it has been said before by hon. Members, this Motion is very unfortunate and I think the Mover might have slept badly that nigh to This is because, if we allow something like this to happen in the Republic, we shall be jeopardizing the affairs of the whole country, our Government and the whole system because anybody from any part of the glebe will be free to come and register in Kenya as a Kenya citizen. So the present system of issuing of identity cards is even supported by wananchi; the local old men and the elders because they also assist in the process of identification. Not anybody come forward and say that "I am a Kenyan and I should be given an identity card". In fact, I strongly doubt whether any sensible system of government would allow something like this one to be done so haphazardly the way the Mover has proposed because it would be very dangerous, as I said earlier on.Sir, I would also like to thank the Office of the President for conducting the recently ended exercise of registering people. They were moving from one location the other registering people using the established system, but not the one that ray hon. friend is trying to advocate. They assisted those without identity cards to get than to enable in them to register as voters. It was a nationalwide exercise. We appreciate the kind of work they did in Western, Eastern, Central and NorthEastern Provinces. They did not stay in their offices; they moved from place to the other registering people. I wish to register my thanks for the kind of good job that was done by the Office of the President.Sir, at this juncture when debating this unfortunate Motion, I would like to remind the Government that some school leavers leave school at the age of 15 years and they cannot be registered before they have attained age of 18 years. For a period of about two or three years, they cannot be employed because they have not attained the age of 18 to be ableto be issued with identity cards. I think: it would be a good idea to consider the plight of these youngsters because not all of them continue with education after Standard VII or VIII So, there is that period after Standard VIII when they cannot be issued with identity cards because they have not attained the required age of 18, This is an issue which I think the Government should consider to know what should be done with those youngsters who leave school when they cannot get identity cards because they have not attained the age of 18 years. This is an issue which requires Government attention.Finally, Sir, it has been decided by hon. colleagues5that this Motion should be opposed by every hon0 Member in this House because by supporting we will be jeopardizing the whole system of our Government. With those fey remarks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to oppose the Motion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. 0MIDO: Thank, you very such, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I alsorise to oppose this Motion very strongly. This Motion, in part,says:"this House urges the Government to allow wananchi to obtain the national identity cards wherever they are within the country without requiring them to obtain prior clearance from the Provincial Administration"Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are now opening our registrationOf persons system to very serious abuses. Anybody will come fromanywhere and walk to any registration centre in the country andsay that he is a Kenyan and he will get an identity card becauseno clearance from the Provincial Administration will be required.That is a very dangerous thing to do, Mr.Speaker, Sir.Mr. Speaker , Sir, what I wouldsuggest here is that theGovernment should look into the system of registration of personsin this country with particular emphasis on those young men andwomen who are leaving school.The registration teams should moveinto schools so that as boys and girls prepare to leave school,after attaining the age of 18 years, they are issued with identitycards. These boys and girls should leave school with.identity cards.This is because when we let these children come out of school without identity cards then the registration centreswill get flooded with these youngsters. You will find that it willbe very difficult indeed for these registration centres to copewith these large numbers of youngsters seeking identity cards. I this because I have experienced the problem at Makadara in myconstituency. There are very many young people queueing for registration every day. This problem could be easeda bit if we sent registration teams to schools like Alliance High School, S Kenya High School and Nairobi School where boys and girls are completing Form VI and are going out to either continue with university education or to join other Kenyans in other fields of our development.The arrangement that I have just mentioned is acceptable. But let me say that the question of allowing anybody to move to any registration centre and to obtain an identity card without prior clearance from the Provincial Administration is very, very dangerous. we could have noncitizens registering as citizens and as some of my colleagues have said here, these could be people who are sent into this country to come and sabotage our economy and so on. So, you will find that since you have registered them as citizens of this country you cannot send them out of the country. This could be a very dangerous thing.So, with these few remarks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I strongly oppose the Motion. </Newspeech><Newspeech> THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENERGY AND REGIONAL.DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Adichareh): Ahsante sana Bw.

Ni laaima mtu ambaye anataka kupewa kitajabulisho Esza awe anajulikana vyema na chifu au naibu wa chifu. Hii ni kwa sababu watu wakikubaliwa kuchukua vitambulisho bila barua ya aina yo yote kutoka kwa chifu, watu wengihe kutoka nchi jirani wataweza kuingia Kenya na kupewa vitambulisho.Tukifanya hivyo tutakuwa tunaitusi na kuichezea sheria yetu Si jambo jema icsx kamwe kuvapa. vitambulisho watu ambao wanaweza kuwa maadui wakubwa wa nchi hii. Ijapokuwa tunataka watu wetu wapate vitambulisho hatusemijambo hili lifanywe bila uangalifu wo wote.

Kama kunaye mwananchi ambaye amekatazwa kitambulisho, hiyo ni kesi ambayo inaweza kufanyiwa kando. Lakini kusema mtu yeyote, popote alipo katika nchi hii apatiwe kitambulisho, bila kujua kule atokako ni jambo lisilokubalika hata kidogo kwa sababu sisi tuna nchi jirani na watu kutoka nchi hizo wanaweza kuingia kutoka humo na kusema wao ni wananchi wa Kenya. Kwa mfano, watu wanaweza kuingia kutoka Somalia, Ethiopia, Tanzania au Uganda na waombe kupewa vitambulisho. Hivyo ndivyo kutumia mamlaka 3a vyema? Je, tutakuwa tukilinda amani ya nchi hii? La, hatukubali mtu yeyote apewe kitambulisho mpaka naibu wa chifu aseme "Mimi najua mama na baba ya huyu mtu, na amezaliws hapa". Mtu akitambuliwa na chifu xa anaweza kupewa kitambulisho. Kama si hivyo, Hoja hii ni lazima ipingwe kab.isa.Kwa hayo machache, naomba kuipinga Hoja hii. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: It is now time for the Governmentresponder.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply to the Motion, onbehalf of the Government.I would like to thank the hon. Member for Mombasa North for bringing this Motion to this House. Idealty, the Motion is an appreciation of the existing freedom enjoyed by Kenyans whereby they are free to work end settle in any of the districts in this country.I also wish commend in general, the other hon. Members who had the opportunity to contribute to this Motion. I want to assure them on the outset that their views have been taken very seriously.Sir, registration of persons is an exercise of importance to any nation, ours included. It is through: this paramount exercise that eligible Kenyans are issued with identity cards a very important document indeed. An identity card is a document required for various purposes. For example recruitment into the armed forces, as a form of identification in financial institutions like banks, post offices, payment of salaries and so forth. The possession of an identity card is also a requirement for those wishing to register themselves as Kanu members and the just concluded voters registration exercise. It is imperative therefore, that those holding Kenya identity cards are in actual fact, true citizens of this country. The prevailing peaceful and stable economic and political situation in this country today under the able and wise leadership of President Daniel Moi undoubtedly,has attracted manyaliens into the country as refugees and otherwise. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Kubai)(Ctd.):It is not a secret that these are aliens who take the slightest advantage ofany slackness in the registration process and present themselves for registration.Hon. Members ,too, are aware of the dangers inherent in a situation where aliens nay be able to register themselves as Kenyans. It is necessary for us as Kenyansto guard, ourselves from such an eventuality by sealing all possible loopholes toensure that no nonKenyans is issued with an identity card.Mr. Speaker, Sir, regretably, what this Motion is urging the Governmentto do is to relax the existing registering system of vetting applicants seeking to obtainidentity cards. The provision of Cap. 107 of the Laws of Kenya, demands that carefulvetting of applicants be done accurately as improper output would subsequentlyrender proper identification impossible. In the absense of proper identification, Illegal registration of nonKenyans would result and that would endanger the security of this country. The existing system of registration of persons is geared to ensure that the registration of nonKenyans is curbed. All applicants have therefore, to be vetted by 1ie provincial administration officials of their home districts; that is chiefs and assistant chiefs. This system, however cumbersome, is the best alternative possible as these officials are the best people suited to determine really those who are of true citizenship status or otherwise. As intimated above, we have today in our Country many aliens and we should not allow a situation where these people will be able to register themselves and thereby acquire Kenyan citizen¬ship status by compromising lie vetting system of applicants.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the number of applicants has been on the increasingIitrend over the years. The increase can be attributed to the many young Kenyans who are becoming of age after the completion of High School education.More recently, the high demand for registration has been occasioned by both KanuJmembership drive as well as the registration of voters. But all in all, to be ableto cope with this trend, the Government has gone a step ahead by expanding the programriAs of today, registration centres have been opened in virtually all administrative divisions in the country. To date, a total of 8,723,676 Kenyans have been issued with identity cards. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF OEE PRESIDENT (Mr. Kubai)(Ctd. ):Finally, Mr. Speaker Sir, I would like to assure this House that theGovernment is taking the registration of persons very seriously in response tomany complaints that are being raised. At the same time, the security of this nationmust be guarded very jealously indeed by all of us. Every attempt will, however,be made to make sure that the issuance of identity cards to genuine Kenyans is done Oexpenditiously. With these few remarks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reject this Motion on behalf of the Government in view of the grave security implications the exercise m have if the existing vetting system of registration is relaxed. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MBORI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, first I am grateful to the Mover of this Motion, Hon. Mwaruwa, Member for Mombasa for having brought this Motion at this time, when registration of young persons from schools and other places over the age 18 years is being done throughout the country. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I say I am grateful to the hon. MEMBER for bringing this Motion to the House because I have taken time to observe what takes place during the registration of young persons by the administration staff and one really wonders about the slow rate at which these young persons are being registered in order to obtain their identity cards. The rate is not only slow but frustrating. The young persons are indeed being frustrated. [you will find somebody attending this exercise for one week, one month or even several months. When a persons goes to apply a for an identity card, he is told to come the following Monday or Friday and this is continued non stop. This is more embarassing to young women who have reached the age of 18 years. These women are told to produce their baptismal certificates or their school leaving certificates and if they do not have any of these, they are asked to produce letters from their fathers confirmingthey are truly married to their husbands andthat their names are suchandsuch. These are so he of the obstacles that have come in the way of the registration of young persons. I would like to give an example of Oyugis which I represent in South Nyanza where young people have been standing outIin the Sunday in day out. Sometimes, some of these young people are told tobring their affidavits to prove that they are married before they are issued with identity cards.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the Mover of this Motion has brought it at the right time this exercise is being carried out and the system is frustrating our young persons. these are the people who are going to take up our places as leaders, in this House and elsewhere but they are being frustrated. This is why I am saying that this Motion has come to house at the right time. I believe also that as a father, you can have a daughter or a son living with you at Mombasa. I am not very clear whether it is mandatory that when your son or daughter wants to be issued with an identity card, he or she must go all the way to Busia to be issued with the identity card. Similarly, I could have my son or daughter attending school at Nyeri or even at Machakos, but I come from Nyanza. When my son or daughter attains the age of 18, I do not think it is fair for the young boy to come all the way from Nyeri or from Mombasa to South Nyanza to be issued with an identity card. I am of the opinion that the HOVER OF this Motion was right in bringing up the Motion at a time as this0 I. support him in that this Motion should remain as it is so that our young persons, wherever they may be, are issued with identity cards without these unnecessary obstacles0 To me, it sounds as if we are discriminating against young persons; our offspring who are going to succeed us. I do not know how we want this thing to be done.When I was young I do not knew whether this was rightI wasgiven ray identity card IN Nyeri although I come from South Nyanza. Why did the colonialists not return me to South Nyanza in order for me to obtain my identity card there? I believe that this Motion is RIGHT. Those who oppose it have a right to do so, but I am of the opinion that this Motion .should remain the way it is, so that our young persons are issued with identity cards because, as Kenyans, they deserve the cards0 If Kenyans are to live wherever they choose in Kenya, why would you expect a Masai from Loitokitok to go back there in order to obtain his identity card there whereas he is working somewhere say, at Kisumu or Kakamega? How is this going to be done?Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe that this Motion has come up at the right time and that these obstacles, which have been put upon young people by the Administration must be removed forthwith in order to allow our young people to get their identity cards0 Who does not know the importance of an identity card? Getting an identity card means that you qualify as a mature Kenyanat the age of 18 years to be a voter or to be voted for and you become and a man who is able to look for his livelihood tomorrow. In the absence of an identity card, no Government, private firm or any individual person will offer you any job.If young people are continually denied identity cards just because they mustgo back to their places of origin, then they are being denied their futurelivelihood in Independent Kenya, and this is a shame on us.With these few remarks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to support thisMotion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MIIHSTSR FOR EKERGY AITB REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Biwott):Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHEKUKD: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir T seek your guidance here0 The Government Responder responded to this Motion, and I wonder whether one could move a slight amendment. I think this is possible. I have been trying to do this, but I have failed miserably. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: I think we are more or less moving on to the nextStage. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Biwott): Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me these few minutes to contribute effectively to this Eotion I think there is some confusion here. If you read the Motion as it stands at the moment, you will see that it leaves wide open the possibility of foreigners having access to our identity cards. </Newspeech>(Applause)<Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir0 This is wherewe have a problem.(Mr. Biwott stood up)Could the hon. Member resume his seat?Is the Minister not repeating what we have been told more than adozen times just because he was not here to hear it? The same argument hasbeen repeated, and it is now being repeated again. Is that in order? Is theMinister aware that Standing Order No.87 forbids such repetition? </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Biwott):Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think that this is calculated just to waste my time. Itis very important that this Motion be understood very clearly. In fact, thisis the reason WHY the HON. Member, who is now interjecting has asked for anAmendment.From the way the Motion is written, and considering the fact thatour borders axe inhabited by people who transcend them, if the Motion is passedin this form, there will be a possibility of an influx of people into thecountry to register themselves because of the flexibility of our own systemthat will exist. So this is because of the security aspect of the matter;not the necescity your people to get identity cards, because this is their right. </Newspeech><Newspeech>TEE MINISTER FOR ENERGY AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (CTD.):The need to ensure that eligible Kenyans are registered easily and withoutmany problems is valid, but this Motion does not portray that particularpicture, The Government has clearly rejected the Motion because of its widepresentation, The presentation is such that if the Motion were passed, wewould be in danger. The argument that the Hon.Member for Kasipul Kabondo advancedIS RIGHT Kenyans must register, be identified and feel proud of having theirown identity cards. This is patriotism. Registering yourself anywhere,provided that it is known that you properly belong to Kenya, is perfectly inorder. I obtained my identity card away from my own district because I couldidentify that I come from a particular place. So, the issue here is not the easewith which Kenyans are enabled to get their identity cards, but the fact thatfrom the way the Motion now stands, it is so wide open and if it is allowed topass in this form, we will have a grave security danger because anybody across our borders speaking the same language and having relatives on this side of the borders can walk in and easily get an identity card0 In that case, we will have problems in no time.Let us not forget that today Kenya is so secure that everybody wants to be IT identified with it. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: We have already been told THAT. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Biwott): Evenif you have been told this, it does not do any harm to also, have a bit of</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Should weallow our Standing Orders to be flouted? Standing Order No. 87 has not beenamended. You should not repeat your own or anybody else's argument. Is the Minister now in order? He has not been here whereas we have been, listening"to this argument, and we are already fed up with it. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.SPEAKER: Well, he now knows where he slipped. This is just because he was not here when this was said. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr.Biwott): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am fully aware of the Standing Orders of this House, 30</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (CTD.):I know about the issue of repetition, but I have not repeated anything. Even if you check what I am saying in the HANSARD tomorrow, you will not find it identical to what has already been said. Therefore, this cannot be repetition. The whole of ray sentence construction must be different from that of my colleagues who spoke before me.The issue at hand, as it is now, is not that the Government is againstfacilitating the registration of persons we are all involved in the exercise of recruiting Kami members and issuing identity cards to all eligibleKenyan. We know that this is a major requirement across which we come daily. Qualified young people would like to register themselves, but this has to be done in such a way that those people who have infiltrated into our country are not registered as Kenyans. because of the lack of thoroughness in our system. No country in the world has a registration system which is so loose that anybody can come in and register himself. We must ensure that we in Kenya have the best registration system. I am not saying that the present registration system is watertight, but it as good as it can be. There could be loopholes in it, and this is where the Government could be urged to ensure that adequate facilities are given so that Kenyans do not get frustrated or held up in registering themselves. The Government could be urged to ensure that the officers who deal with such registration spare no effort in seeing that every Kenyan who needs to be registered is registered. However, that is a different issue from the one that is being presented in this Motion as it is at the moment. It is precisely for that reason that we are opposing the Motion. We are Kenyans and elected Members of Parliament, although some of us sit on the Front Bench. It is not less important to us in the Front Bench than it is to BackBenchers to ensure that our people are registered. They are Members of Parliament just as we are, and we all have similar problems. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGYAND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Contd.):It is the security of the nation that comes first. It is the 'undiluted' Kenyan that we must protect to make sure that when he walks at night and says, "I am a Kenyan", he is trully a Kenyan. Otherwise, we will have so many people who will be 'marauding' having obtained Kenyan citizenship and, therefore, have access to our pass¬port, and use it to go out and attack our own country. We know of one or two cases who have had access from other countries and are now taking us to task.With those few remarks, Sir, I beg to oppose the Motion. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MRSPEAKER: It is now time for the Mover to reply. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWARUWA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, with permission from the Chair, could hon. Lukindo and hon. Shikuku each be allowed two minutes to contribute to this Motion? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LUKINDO: Ahsante sana, Bw. Spika. Namshukuru sana mhe. Mbunge kwa kunipatia nafasi.hii.Kusema kweli, Bw. Spika, kitarabulisho ni kitu cha maana sanakatika Kenya. Lakini wakati wa kukipita, masharti juu ya kupatawA kitambulisho ni lazima yawekwe mkazo kweli kweli. hayakabisa. Lakini kwa mara ya kwanza, mtu wa Kenya akipata kitambulisho,kwa hakika ni :.lazima apitie kwa naibu wa chifu, ehifu rawenyewe nayeyote yule ili kuhakikisha kwamba yeye ni rnvananchi wa Kenjra.Lakini ajabu ni kwamba wakati mwingine mtu hupoteza kitarabulisho.na yeye anafanya kazi mbali sana. Pengine anaibiwa pamoja na vyombovyake. Yeye anafanya kazi Mombasa au mbali sana. Akipoteza, anakuwaanapiga ripoti kwa polisi. Mimi sioni sababu mtu huyo aliyepotezakitambulisho okaketwi duplicate au nakili yake iko kwa inkuu wa wjjayni kwa nini inamlazimisha arudi ;npaka akamuone naibu wa chifu na chifu ili apate nakili ya kile kitambulisho chalce. Nafikiri kufany; hivyo ni kupoteza wakati pamoja na pesa. Kv.a hivyoj Hoja hii naiunga mkono sana. Ni heri marekebisho yafanywe kwa sababu sisi tumeletwa hapa na wananchi, na mahali wana poona wakitatisika, wanatuambia sisi. Pia, kulingana na Katiba yetu ya Kenya, tuna uhuru wa kurekebisha, kuondoa, na tuna uhuru wa kuongeza sheria nyingine. Kwa hivyo, ikiwa sheria inawauiniza wananchi ambao tunawawakilisha hapa, sioni ni kwa nini niatakwa ya wananchi waliotutuma hapa yapuuzwe, Hiyo ni kusema kwamba ningeonelea mare kebisho yafanywe ili vatoto wachanga wapatiwe vitambulisho vikipotea bila ya kuenda kwa naibu wa chifu. Hii ni kwa sababu sheria yoyote inatungva ili kuwafaa wananchi lakini siyo eti sheria isimame lcama mti na haiwezi kuondoka. Watu wenyewe ndio wanaopaswa kubadilisha sheria ili iwafae. Kwa hivyo, marekebisho yakifanywa, Bw. Spika, mimi nitaiunga mkono Hoja hii. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir. It is just too bad that I did not catch your eye in the course of this debate. I was here throughout from the beginning.Facts are the Motion is not as bad as it has been painted to be. Facts remain that there is discrimination, and that is what the hon. Mover said when he was moving the Motion. When you are black in Mombasa, it is impossible for you to get your identity card. But if you happen to be 'brownish1 or slightly 'whiter', then there is no problem at all. This is the issue we are supposed to look at now.Secondly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Biwott): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. That is a very serious issue because Kenya stands for all, and Kenya has no discrimination at all. If there is discrimination, can somebody substantiate that it is so? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, you can see the problem this House has got. The hon. Member was not here. It was spoken by the hon. Mover himself, and this is what made him bring this Motion here. We want anybody, from wherever he is, to get his identity card there ratherthan sending him way back to where he originated from. That was theproblem. I, Mr. Shikuku, was born in Lake Magadi, and I was broughtup in Butere. When I came up for a job I was registered at LakeMagadi. I got my identity card there. They did not send me back toButere to look for my assistant chief. The essence of this Motionis to have all</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENERGY AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT(Mr. Adichareh): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The hon.Member or Mover is talking of discrimination and want this to besubstantiated. We do not have any discrimination in Kenya. We shallnot allow anybody to cross the border and be given identity card. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the hon. Member wantssubstantiation, I would like to do it right for him here. We knowthere is discrimination in this country. For instance? one day, anAfrican an employee of the Voice of Kenya was beaten up here bya Mhindi, and the Mhindi lias never been taken to court The other;day; we had Hemed and Maitha case in Mombasa. Today, we have I Hemedbeing forgiven and Maitha is not being forgiven. This is happeningin Mombasa. We know of so many cases. I do not know why this Ministersleeps There is discrimination in this country, and there is no useyou</Newspeech><Newspeech>HC SPEAKER: Mr. Shikuku, will speak on the Motion? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am speaking on the Motion.I have been challenged to substantiate that there is discriminationin the country, and that is what I am trying to do now. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.SPEAKER: Okay, you may go back to the subject matter. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I continue. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Biwott):On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I raised this point of orderso as to do something to end discrimination in this country. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Contd.):The hon. Member who is now speaking, quotes the Mover. It istrue that I was not there; I accept that. But he alleges that thereis discrimination in Mombasa as far as registration of persons isconcerned. We want to know who was discriminated against in thisidentity card registration where somebody else was given an identitycard and an African was refused so that action can be taken? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is common knowledge. Theblack man in Mombasa is still down trodded. We know it. Even I gavethe most recent example. Why did they not forgive Maitha? It isbecause he had wrong pigmentation While that Arab Hemedwas cleared. We know and I know it. I speak as a very senior, politician in this country that there is discrimination in the Coast. I know it, and that is why I fought the colonialists. I do not know v>here these hon. Members were? They were probably eating their potato in the kitchen. But I know it for certain. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Biwott): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I must insist on this because it is good for the country. We must not confuse the issues. MaithaS is a Kanu affair, and we will deal with, it when we are in Kanu. But we want substantiation on discrimination that pertains to the regist¬ration of persons which is a right, and not a privilege. People must be given identity cards. But we want to know who has been discrimi¬nated against so that action can be taken. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a shame that the hon. Minister should take my time when he had his time and told us nothing, other than repeating himself. He should sit down to listen to some wisdom from somebody who knows what he is talking about. Substantiate means that you either saw, know, and that is what you base your argument on. I know, I was there and I fought the colonialists. There is discrimination in the Coast. Even today people in theCoast are actually without land. They are all squatters. There is discrimination in the Coast. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Mr. Shikuku, may I remind Mr. Mwaruwa that he was the one who was to speak last, and the time is almost over. So it is now time for the Mover to repy. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWARUWA: Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I beg to move. </Newspeech>(Question put and negatived) <Newspeech>MR. JCLLIKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the following Motion:THAT, in view of the fact that water flowing through Mzima Water Pipeline towards Mombasa can¬not adequately serve the increased water consumpt¬ion on West Mainland (where there are several industries and a large population); this House urges the Government to lay an additional water pipeline from Mzima to Mombasa to augment the present water supply.. Mr. Speaker, Sir, what has necessitated me to move such a very important Motion at this very time is that the present Mzima Water Pipeline was laid sometime back when there were very few people in this particular area and when there were no industries in the area. As we are' talking here now, the demand for water in this area is very high although the capacity and the volume of the pipeline remain the same. We have been experiencing water shortage problems in Mombasa, especially in Mombasa West Mainland, where so many people want water which is hardly there. I am also moving this Motion on the strength of a promise made by a permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Water Development on the Christmas Eve of 1985. At that time, there was a serious burst of water pipes and there was no water in the area. The then permanent secretary in the Ministry of Water Development happened to tour Mombasa, and he promised wananchi that the Government was going to solve the problem in the area by laying an additional water pipeline. It is a long period of time from December, 1985 to now, and we have all along been waiting for what the permanent secretary promised the people. Nothing so far has j happened. Maybe, what we were given was an empty promise aimed at cooling; down the people because they were complaining. Perhaps the permanent secretary was not serious. That is why I have to move this Motion at this time in order to remind the Ministry that they did a very big mistake by giving the people ofMombasa West Mainland a promise that did not materialise. [Mr. Speaker left the Chair][The Temporary Deputy Speaker(Mr. Mutiso) took the Chair]That is very serious. If a Government official knows that something is not' going to happen, it is not good to commit the Government to wananchi such that wananchi start thinking that the Government has failed to fulfil its promise when, in fat, it is a mistake made by the Government official.Mr. Temporary Deputy. Speaker, Sir, when this water supply was started in Mombasa, there was the Water Pipeline Board whose responsibility was to look into the' water supply problems in that area. However, this Board was lie dissolved some¬times back and has not resumed its duties. That is the kind of problem I wanted to point out to the Ministry concerned. The other reason why we have this water shortage problem is that we have only three water tanks in this area, which accommodate only 35 million gallons of water. We want more water tanks in this area so that water can be stored in case of any shortage. The other cause of our problem is the pipeline from Baricho which comes from a place called Lango Baya 50 miles from Malindi. That pipeline was supposed to pump some 12 million gallons of water but it does not do so because of itxes the pumping system. In fact, the water that passes through that pipeline is only 8.5 million gallons per day. That isanother reason why we have problems throughout in Mombasa.Sir, I do not know why the planners in the Ministry of Water Develop¬ment have been so shortsighted that they do not plan according to the demand of the people. It is high time the Ministry recognised the problem of water in this country because we not only have such problems in Mombasa alone but also elsewhere in the country. I take this opportunity to thank His Excellency the President for appointing hon. Mwendwa the Minister for Water Development because he comes from a district which has been experiencing water problems. If those dry areas in this country are not going to get water supplied to them now, then it x will be quite unfortunate. There will not be any reason why the country should not blame the Minister because he has a practical experience of water problems.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, everything we do e depends on water. When the Government Responder replies to this Motion, he should not forget theThat is very serious. If a Government official knows that something is not' going to happen, it is not good to commit the Government to wananchi such that wananchi start thinking that the Government has failed to fulfil its promise when, in fat, it is a mistake made by the Government official.Mr. Temporary Deputy.

There will not be any reason why the country should not blame the Minister because he has a practical experience of water problems.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, everything we do e depends on water. When the Government Responder replies to this Motion, he should not forget thepromise which was given by a former permanent secretary in that Ministry of Water Development. . I would also like the Government Responder to say something about the construction of more water tanks in the area in question. When the Ministry is laying pa water pipelines, especially in TaitaTaveta District, it should be done such that the pipeline has outlets in order to supply the people of TaitaTaveta and Kilifi with water. It is not good to bypass wananchi when it comes to supplying either water or electricity. All people are equal and, therefore, there is no reason why a certain group of people should be bypassed when doing things like laying water pipes or installing electricity. In fact, k one of the reasons why the Mzima Water Pipeline bursts all the time is that there are no outlets. To say the truth, the pipeline does not breathe when it is hot, something that makes it burst due to high pressure. Why can the planners who plan water pipelines not consider having outlets so that the pipe can breathe? It is common sense to see why we need outlets in pipelines.Mr. Tempoary Deputy Speaker, Sir, water problemis understandable to everybody in this House, and I will not take a long time talking about this very important Motion. I think the Ministry will do something this time. I also want to remind the Minister of another promise they have given us. We have a lot of paper promises. For example, we have been promised that by the year 2000  everybody is going to have water supplied to him. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are now in 1987 and we have only 13 years to go and this is a very short time to plan for anything. I do not know what efforts the Ministry has made to give the people water by the year 2000. If the Ministry does not do this, then it would be very bad. That is why I said that the Government's officials should not commit the Government by making promises which do not materialise. If they do s not have money to accomplish their plans, they should speak the truth because the truth must prevail.With those few points, I beg to move the Motion and with your per¬mission, Sir, I would like to call upon my colleague, hon. Mwaruwa, to second this very important Motion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAKUWA: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir,to allow me to join my hon. colleague in this Motion and I strongly support it. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. arap Cheboiwo): You are seconding and not moving the Motion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>KR. MWARUWA: You cannot correct me in the usage of the English language; I can teach you EnglishThe problem of water is not new in this country. Water is very important and we cannot do anything without water. Water has become very essential to everybody. Sir, particularly in my constituency, Mombasa North, and where my colleague comes from, that is, Mombasa West, availability of water has become very difficult; there is no water there. Last year, people in Mombasa North went for about a month without rater. I brought that Question to this hon. House and later on moved a Motion to that effect. When the Minister and his Assistant Ministers came to reply, they did not satisfy me at all. They just came here, with their paper and read them as though they were reading story books. I would like the Minister and his Assistant Ministers to take very serious conderation with regard to water in any part of the country. This is because water is the key of whatever we do. Before Independence, there was a good example which we must now take into account. This was in connection with having piped water from Taita to Mombasa. These pipes did not burst on any one day; they stayed under the earth for quite some time. During that time, there was no complaint about water because we were very happy about it. Since we took over, the Government has tried its best to make sure that water is made available to the people of this country. As my hon. colleague said, we really do not know what the Government officers who are running those Ministries are doing in their offices. This is because a water pipeline from Taita to Mombasa or from Mombasa to Nairobi, should be given time to breath. For example, after every 100 kilometres, water should be allowed to flow from a given pipe freely. This is to allow the pipes to have some breathing space instead of leaving them to burst. Since the officers of the Government are so much African and jelcusy of those people who are utilizing the water which is pouring freely by diverting it to their shambas and doing a lot of good cultivation, they decided to close those taps. In the event of doing so, these officers cost the Government a lot of money in buying new pipes and replacing the old ones now and then.Some time back, the Ministry laid a new pipe which did not last very long; it lasted for about one year before bursting. Secondly, it seems as though the Minister, his Assistant Ministers and engineers only buy very cheap mater¬ials for use. I do not know where they take the rest of the money. They should stand up and tell us. I can see an Assistant Minister for Water Development who is seated there is listening very carefully. I will be. very happy if he can tell us where the rest of the money goes. This is because we pass money in this House for particular Ministry to be used only for that particular function. After they have got the money, things do not seem to go right. The r. Ministry lays plastic pipes which do not last very long. This is too bad When we pass money for that good purpose, it should be used in a very good way.While seconding this Motion, Sir, I would like to ask the Ministry tomake sure that the problem of water is eradicated in all parts of the country. It is not only Mombasa which has water problems but also places like Macbakos Kitui, Kicumu, Luhyalcnd and so on We have Lake Victoria which is full of fresh water. I do no see the reason why the Ministry does not make use of that lake to make the country rich with water; the country should not be left to suffer by not having water. What we see is the Minister and his Assistant Ministers driving big Mercedes Benz cars roaming here and there eating kuku because they have a lot of water in their houses. This is why they do not think of other peoples problems. For how long shall we be afraid of telling them the truth? I, Mr. Mwaruwa, the son of a woman, stand here to tell them the truth that they do not do their job properly.While I am still on that, they should not bring in the questions that Mr Mwaruwa brings sensitive Motions or Mr. Mwaruwa is dangerous to the Government. That is wrong. I think some hon. Members who stood here and said that Mr. Mwaruwa brings sensitive Motions which are dangerous to the Government are wrong. It seems that they do not know the meaning of danger and if they do, then they should not say so. As an elected Member of Parliament, I have the right to bring any kind of Motion here and it is entirely upon this House to accept that Motion or not. They should not stand here to speak if they have gone bankrupt of what to say; they hadbetter sitdown and keep quiet. They should not stand here and say: "Mr. Mwaruwa’s Motions are so sensitive and dangerous.” Do you put me into the class of Mwakenya? That is h what you mean when you say that this Motions is going to be dangerous to the country. What kind of danger would that Motion have brought?Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am more Nyayo than those peoplewho call themselves Nyayo. I would like them to understand that. They must remember that I wa3 elected by the people in the same way they were elected. Such hon. Members are trying to be ignorant about the people who have elected them and that is why they stand here and Say So. I am not trying to forget my people.;This Motion on water is very important and it will not be surprising to see some hon. Members standing and opposing it. I do not know WHAT they are up to. We must understand that jobs of Ministers and Assistant Ministers have been given to other people There are no more Even if an hon. Member stands up and opposes this Motion, he should know that he will not get n the post of an Assistant Minister or a Minister. All those chances have gone. We should stand here as men.I was told by hon. Leakey, an European Member of Parliament,to withdraw MY Motion. I Mr. Mwaruwa, and conforming with my Manhoodand married with children, would be ashamed to withdraw that Motion. I would never withdraw it, and I did not. I wanted it to pass the way it was. I was defending my manhood. </Newspeech><Newspeech> THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENERGY AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Adichareh): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think the hon. Member is not contributing to the current Motion, he is  talking on the previous Motion which was rejected. He should, therefore, revert to the current Motion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWARUWA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, that Motion was very important, and we urge that the Minister and his &xx Assistant Ministers</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Mutiso): Order Mr. Mwaruwa, you are seconding the current Motion, and would you please stick to it? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWARUWA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I was on the right track, unless .my hon. friend, the Assistant Minister did not understand my English. I do not speak American English because Americans speak broken English; I speak British English.With those few remarks. I beg to strongly support thisMotion. </Newspeech>(Question proposed)<Newspeech>MR. KIKUYU: Thank you Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for  giving me a chance to support this Motion.The Hover of this Motion, hon. KililKu, had a very good idea. Most of our towns are expanding && fast, with people moving from rural areas to urban areas, such that the facilities offered by the towns are not sufficient and neither are they anywhere near "being adequate to support the populations there.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, considering that Mombasa is the second largest town in the country second only to Nairobi and that the Mzima water pipeline was laid a few years back and that since it was laid, the population of Mombasa has increased drastically especially in the areas west of the Mombasa Island, where there are very many factories and large housing estates, it appears necessary that the Govern¬ment should e accept this Motion without amendment because it asks what the Government should be doing by now, unless it wants to be overtaken by events and the whole of the town is put into a water crisis.Although the Motion is specifically on Mombasa Town, many other towns in the Republic are facing water shortages due to population increase a coupled with the starting of rural industrialization. This has put strains on the supply of water to those town, such that most areas must have their water supply rationed, hence making town life is bit difficult. The Mover of this Motion had the idea of easing the life of the people in Mombasa, and especially in the Mainland areas where the population is expanding very fast. As I mentioned earlier, these problems exist in most of our towns. Machakos is a case in point. The water supply in thetown, which was put up in 1957, is not adequate to cope with thepopulation which has increased almost twenty. We, therefore,urge the Ministry to look, sincerely, into the planning of urbanwater supply systems. Whereas we would like to see every home in the townshipsHaving piped with water, as a first step towards achieving this goal, we need proper planning of urban water supply systems. Urban areas do not have wells from which they could get water, like it happens in the rural areas. Likewise, they do not have rivers which are not polluted, like in the rural areas. The people in urban areas must be Provided with piped water, otherwise the rest of the water in the urban areas polluted. We would, therefore, urge the Minister for Water Development to start planning seriously on water supply systems in the urban areas.I am saying this S because most of the times, these planners are overtaken by events; they start planning for water when the town is already too congested. There is not enough water; the water that is available cannot allow industrial expansion and it cannot even feed the population. We are also calling upon the water engineers in to start thinking of recirculating the available water if the resource, according to them, is so scarce that we cannot increase its supply from the wells, boreholes rivers or dams that we have. Recirculating this water would ease the problem of water shortages.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we cannot go on saying that we are giving our people adequate services when a woman in a place like Katulani in Machakos District has to travel for about; four kilometers to fetch water, a woman who is in a town. How is that? We should not let life in town deteriorate so much that aperson living in the town is worse off than a person living in rural area when we consider the water situation in most towns in the country. If you take an example of these people living on the slopes of Mount .Kenya, you will find that they are better endowed with water than a person in Mombasaor Machakos Town and yet we are calling these towns urban areas.Are these urban areas affluent when the living conditions in them are so filthy due to lack of water? we urge the Minister and his staff to rededicate themselves and start proper plan-ning, of urban water supply systems.With those few remarks, I beg to support. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MICH0I.1A: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary DeputySpeaker, Sir, for giving this opportunity to contribute on thistimely Motion. Water is very essential to human Life. It is alsovery essential in industrial activities. Without water nothingcan be done in this world. I would like to say that the Ministryof Water Development has done a very good job. The Ministry hasalso told the entire population of Kenya that by the year 2000 A.D.we shall have water taps near the people's homes. This isimpracticable, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, because theGovernment does not have adequate funds to finance such a huge project. Let us call a spade a spade.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I know t.iat theMinistry of Water Development has its own planners. Bit thoseplanners have misled this good Government of ours. We have tobe told where we need to expand water supplies. We should also betold which districts need water more than others. This is thereason why His Excellency the President saw it fit to introducethe District Focus for Rural Development Strategy. Recommendationby district development committees have not been taken seriously.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have said time andagain, in this Parliament and in the previous one, that there are urban centres which need water more than others. For instance the whole area of Ukambani and the North Eastern Province and parts of Rift Valley Province are very dry. These areas need water very desperately. But you will find that this problem has not been taken seriously by the Ministry of Water Development. For how long are the District Development Committees in KLtui, Machakos, Marsabit, Baringo and Samburu, going to make recommendations, one after another, without these recommendations being—implemented? Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, when the Minister for Water Development stands to respond to the views of hon. Members he should tell this House in very clear terms whether or not people should continue expecting water from the Ministry or whether they should devise their own methods of getting water. I think towns in this country have been planned without adequate water supplies. I have been to Macliakos and kitui and I know what I am talking about. The Mover of this Motion as says that Mombasa Town faces many water problems. Also Kisii Town which is expected to get water from kuja River has no water. </Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: Where is the water? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MICHOMA: Where is the water? The Ministry must tell us where the water is. The Minister for Water Development must tell us whether priorities mean anything to Ms Ministry. You will find that those areas which were neglected during the colonial era have not been taken into account.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have over worked our leader His Excellency the President. He is the only one who has been able to foresee what will happen in 200 years to come.But some of US Hon. Members do not see it that way. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. arap Cheboiwo): Especially the nominated Members: </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MICHOMA: Even some of the Government officers do not see it that way. </Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: Na Wabunge wakuteuliwa je? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MS. MICHOIIA: If some nominated Members are not seeing far, it is not hon. Michoma who is not seeing fax. I must say this quite frankly because I am not one of them. </Newspeech><Newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: You are fight: </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MICHOMA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like the Minister when he stands up to respond to tell us how industries can be established in Kakamega, Mombasa and in all towns so as to alleviate "the problem of unemploy¬ment in this country.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Member for Butere, hon. Shikuku,has said time and again in this Houses that if you go outside here, you will find young school leavers coming to see hon. Members and asking them to seek employmentfor them. Mr. Temporary Deputy. Speaker, I think. </Newspeech>QUORUM<Newspeech>MS. SHIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Member on the Floor. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. arap Cheboiwo): But you have already interrupted him. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: I am doing it because I have to carry out my duty in this House which is to ensure that this House has the requisite number of hon. Members. </Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: Do not talk about lack of quorum. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, there is no quorum. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Mutiso): Yes, there is no quorum. Will you ring the Division Bell? </Newspeech>(The Division Bell was rung)<Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Mutiso): We have a quorum now. Will you continue, Mr. Michoma. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MICHOMA: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker. I was saying that our town planners are responsible for Planning where water supplies are going to installed,in accordance with the recommendations of the district development committees.From time to time, hon. Members in this House have raised Questions, one after the other, but they are always told, "Go back to your district development committee"The district development committees have done their job and we all know that Membersof this House are Members of the district development committees, but for how longare we going to be told to go back to these committees? It is time for the Ministerfor Water Development to come out and tell us, if there are no funds available,what the money which this country borrows every time, does. I think the Ministryof Water Development has a share in the blame and the Minister should tell us whetherit is possible for us to plan for water in our towns or not. If it is not possible, he should tell us what to do because he knows better. We are not in the Maji House Those in Maji House should be able to tell us what they are trying to do. Otherwise we should either forget all about water projects. We needwater for human and animal consumption. When you go to shops, you find imported water in bottles. That is a shame. It is as if we have no water.I would like the Minister, when replying, to tell us whether his Ministry should not help us in alleviating the problem of unemployment in this country. We can put up industries and youth polytechnics, but we cannot do this without water. This is a straightforward motion and the Minister should be able to tell us what his problem is in the Ministry. Is it that he has no planners? His Excellency the President has been spoken on this issue time and again. Why does the Minister not heed what His Excellency the President has been saying? We cannot make him sing a "chorus" every now and then.With these few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR WATER DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Kiptanui): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I stand up to say that the Motion is straightforward. It has been the policy of the Ministry of Water Development to get a second water pipeline constructed from Mzima Springs to Mombasa. A promise to this effect has been there for quite a long time, but it has not been implemented. The problem that I would like to state here is that financial constraints have been experienced in the Ministry. We are doing our best to get a donor to finance this project in order to alleviate the problem of water shortage in Mombasa. We know that this pipeline was constructed a long time ago, but it was proved that it was not catering for the needs of the people of Mombasa, andother areas along the pipeline. What we did was that we initiated another project namely Sabaki Water Supply to cater for Mombasa, Kilifi and Lamu. This is a supplement to Mzima Springs Water Pipeline. Since what I have said is the policy of the Government, we accept the Motion as it is, but with a minor amendment to the effect that it will be implemented when funds are available. It has been pointed out here that the Ministry should come out and tell this House WHAT we are planning. The year 2000 is when we are going to launch the Decade for water and Sanitation Programmes Our problem is money and that is why I said that this Motion will be implemented when funds are available. We are unable to get enough money to construct this giant water supply. This project will cost much more money than we able to get now. So, what we are doing is that we are negotiating with donor countries to give us money to fund the projectsWe have plans and we are hopeful that before long, we willcome out with an announcement that the second pipeline from Mzimabe started. I also remember that we have been requested by thisHouse to supply water to Machakos from Loitckitok spring. The other day, we witnessed His Excellency the President laying the found¬ation stone of the pipeline from Loitokitok to supply water to Machakos, That was as a result of funds being made available from the Australian Govern¬ment. We hope we will be able to get a donor country to assist us in laying this pipeline.Sir, when we talk of planners, we have them. But the constraint of funds is what makes the Ministry appear as if they do not have any plans. But they have. We have recommendations from the district development committees, and if we go by the system that is in practice that a district development committee has to identify the sources of water supply, when they send their proposals to the Ministry.  We will go by then.They also do the costing because the district water engineers are the people who have the knowledge for planning, and they know thecost of each project. So, we have not been able to finance all the  projects within the Republic, but we are hopeful that before long,we shall get some donor countries to help us.So, Sir, I beg to move the following amendment. After theword "Government" in the fifth line, insert the following words: "when funds are available".Sir, I beg to move the amendment,, </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENERGY AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT(Mr. Mwicigi): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I want to secondthe amendment. What the Assistant Minister is saying is correct. The project is good, but we need money. The Assistant Minister also sees this problem that additional water is required along the Coast, both for local people and also for the tourists. The need is there. Sir, there have been plans to have an additional water pipe¬line in that area. So, I want to thank the Mover OF this Motion for coming up with that idea, and also request him to agree with this amendment because without money, and other resources, nothing can be done.  It is important for Mombasa to have more water. Whether it is the mainland, East or West, Mombasa should have more water because it is one of the most attractive areas around the world due to the beaches there. You get all sorts of people, including millionaires, wishing to go to Mombasa because it has all sorts of advantages. So, we hope that the Ministry will look for money in order to see to it that water supply in Mombasa is expanded. We also hope that this area will be given the priority it deserves.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, water is so important that, perhaps, is it second to air which we breathe. Human beings need water for their survival; we need water for our livestock; we need water for our crops and we need water to fight against drought. So, water is almost the life of everything. It is important that the entire Republic of Kenya is covered with water. But, due to limited resources, we have to sort out what priorities water should be given. The designers who decide on the sizes of pipes of water from point A to B often ignore the fact that population gets bigger and the demand for water goes high. They should consider the element of the population increase. Most of our designers design these things just for the present, and that is a mistake. If Mzima Pipeline was given the necessary consideration, perhaps, we could not be experiencing the present kind of problem. Let there be water everywhere. Let us utilise the waters of Lake Victoria, Lake Naivasha, Mzima Springs and other sources of water to provide our people with water.Sir, there is something else which is also equally important. For example, there is drought in a lot of areas of the Republic. However, soon there will be very heavy rains with flood water taking everything to Indian Ocean and therest of the water will be going  through River Nile to the other side of Africa.Why can we not construct big dams to contain or to hold this water so that we canpreserve it for a bad day? This is something which should also be considered in a larger way. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. now that we are talking about water, I would like to say that we need some more water in my area now that the place has another one more constituency called Gatanga. We need one more intake so that the two constituencies do not share the  same intake when it has seven locations. If we had another Intake, each constituency will be having its own water scheme. The Government can also give us some extra funds to complete the part of Kandara Water Project which is not completed yet. It is important that we use water well where we have either Government—aided water schemes or where we haveHaraiabee water schemes. What normally happens is that where is an easy flow of water, people tend to leave their taps open. When those pipes discharge water day and night, the consequences are not good because some people use more water than others. In fact, it is those people living on the lower sides who do not get adequate water.  Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have to consider donors who are helpful to us. The European Economic Community has done a lot and the Inter¬national Monetary Fund can also take up some other projects. In each district, there are water project designs. When these designs are ready and we go to ask for aid while considering what we have in our files, it  makes things much easier if we  follow this procedure. I do not want to take much time because there are other hon. Memberswho would like to speak. I would like us to know one thing that we asleaders of this country, should not sleep. We should ask ourselves: "Havewe satisfied our people with a basic requirement called water?" Access towater helps women a great deal. This is because according to most of ourtraditions, fetching water from rivers is the responsibility of women. Iam bold to state that if the responsibility of going to the river to fetch water wasmen's, every home would have water today. But because women arethe ones who are responsible, for producing children and going to fetch waterfrom the river, they bear a big burden and they should, therefore, be assisted.Therefore, we should give consideration to those poor ladies who are doing this difficult job. I would also like to reemphasise the need of more water everywhere including Kandara. I would like to say we badly need a second intake for Kandara Water Scheme.With those few remarks, I support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUNYAO: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me time to say a few words on this very important Motion. I would like to thank the Mover of the Motion, hon. Kiliku, for his genuine concern about his own constituency and the general public at large. The Msima Water Project and the improvements which are going to be put up are not only going to serve the Chaagamwe and Miritini people but other people as well. As hon. Mwicigi said this water will serve the people of Mombasa including tourists. I would like to say these things point by point. Water, as the hon. Member for Kandaranow Gatangasaid, is very important. Water is second to air because you need it after every one hour and so on. We must accept that water is very important. A project like the Mzima Vfater Project which emanates from Chyulu Hills and goes all the way to Mombasa, must be taken up very seriously. Where water is tapped, we must have some water points so that the people enroute the pipeline can also have water. Having expressed my concern about people in Mombasa and TaitaTaveta who will actually benefit from the Mzima Water Project,  we cannot forget people from other areas who, like hon. Michoma said, need water also. Machakos, Lodwar, Turkana, Baringo and so on need water. The Government has to take the water policy differently by pinpointing some of the areas which need water. Since we have established that water is very important, the policy of its distribution has to be understood genuinely.As I speak:, I am not ashamed to say that water is very expensive in this country apart from, what we have said that it is also very important. I get shocked when I hear that so and so's water has been disconnected. We know that water is very important. It has to be a general policy of the Govern-ment that water should not be disconnected even if he has not paid for it. If it is a family of, say, hon. Munyao, hon. Michoma, hon.Omido in Bahati who is affected when water is disconnected, it is those gentlemen I have mentioned h who pay for the reconnection but not their families. When you disconnect THE water supply, you make people offer because they were dependent on that water. Such a man who dis¬connects other people's water supply should be taken to court or his salary should be attached. He should not make families suffer by disconnecting their water supply.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, water is very expensive in this country. If you take the examples of Changamwe, Karingo and the other lowclass estates, you will find that water in those places is the most expensive item. So, I am calling upon the Government to review water rates in most of these areas. I would not mind if the people in Muthaiga, Lavingfcon and such like areas were supposed to pay a bit more for water. But for the people living in areas like Maringo, Miritini, Changamwe and such like places, water should be the cheapest thing because these people have low incomes. How else do we support the idea that water is important and yet it is so expensive?Over the weekend, I went to an area which you know so well, called Kjatangini,which used to be in Makueni but now it is in Mbooni, and I was surprised. This area has a water project known as Katangi Water Project which gets its water from River Thwakeo The point of collection of this water  has been done is a very haphazard manner. This is a very big river, but the project itself has been done in a haphazard manner by the Ministry. This is the only source of water in that area. This water project is in the middle of Katangini in Kalawa Location. I was so surprised, I almost wept when I saw that water was being sold to the people of that area at Sh.5 per drum; a calabash of about 20 litres is being sold at Sh.l. How many people in such a dry area in the middle of nowhere can afford to buy this water? This is very bad. Our good Government </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE VICEPRESIDENT AND MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. Kibaki) : On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. This is a point of order which does not strictly concern what the hon. Member is saying.I am just wondering whether, for the convenience of the hon. Members of this House the House would agree that when we come to the interruption of business, we adjourn until tomorrow, to enable us, as hon. Members of Parliament, to join : the President at the airport, to receive the President of Nigeria, who is arriving at the same time as when our business of the House would have commenced in the afternoon. I was more hesitant to propose that we meet at a later hour because we may not know the exact hour to commence business, if we adjourn now. So, for neatness, I thought it would be better for us to resolve to meet tomorrow and, therefore, miss the afternoon sitting. This is for a very worthwhile cause, because we are quite a receptive and hospitable nation.Could I, therefore, propose that when the House comes to the interruption of business, it does adjourn until tomorrow, Thursday? </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Biwott) seconded. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

The Question is on the District Officer's office at Ndurarua, and not Ndararua. </Newspeech><i>Question No. 592</i>MR. GACHANJA asked the Minister of State, Office of the President:(a)	when the construction of the District Officer's office at Ndurarua, near Kawangware Village, Dagoretti Constituency, commenced;(b)	when this project is going to be completed; and(c)	why it has been delayed for so long.<Newspeech>THE MINISTER OF STATE, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr.OLE Tipis):  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to.(a) The construction of the District Officer's office in Dagoretti had initially started as a chief's office in 1983. In 1986 the project was merged to include the District Officer's office.(b) The project will be completed when enough funds become available. In the meantime, the project has been allocated Shs.100,000= this financial year.(c) The delay involved has been caused by the lack of funds. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. GACHANJA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, with all due respect to the answer given by the hon. Minister, you will agree with me that 1983 is a long time ago. When the Minister consoles us by saying that the project will be completed when funds are available and then adds that Shs.100,000= has been allocated to it, that is confusion. Could he really clarify as to when exactly this Shs.100,000= will be made available? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ole TIPIS: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if my hon. friend and colleaguewould listen TO ME CAREFULLY, I would want to clarify this issue. The projectwas initially started as a chief’s office in I983, whereupon it was allocatedShs.60,000= by the Government. With this amount, the foundation was laid,and the project came to a standstill due to the exhaustion of the money thenavailable. In 1986, the project was revived and this time, combined to includethe Dagoretti District Officer's office. The fund received a boost, for whichI must thank the hon. Member, of Shs.70,000= collected on a Harambee basis from the Kawangware Market Committee. As I said, is this financial  year  of l98788,the project is in the budget which has already been passed and an additionalShs.100,000= has already been approved by this august House. This will assistin the completion of the project, and if there are any shortfalls here andthere, of course, the Government is fully committed to have this project completed. </Newspeech><i>Que s ti on No. 619 </i>MR. OTWANI asked the Minister of State, Office of the President:(a)	whether he is aware that Mr. Livingstone F. Muganda, PNo. 190539, IDNo. 082825963, retired from service as an assistant chief grade IA on 31st December, 1982;(b)	whether he is further aware that he has not been paid his retirement benefits and pension; and(c)	when he will be paid this money which is due tohim.<Newspeech>THE MINISTER OF STATE, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. ole Tipis): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(a)	Yes, I am aware.(b)	No.(c)	According to our records, Mr. Livingstone E. Muganda was paid commuted pension gratuity of Shs.33,677.50 through the District Commissioner, Bungoma, on 13th October; 1983. He is also being paid pension of Shs.607.30 monthly with effect from 1st January, 1983. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OTWANI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, perhaps I will ask the Minister to tell the house why this former Assistant Chief still expccted to receive "benefits from the Government up to 1st July, 1937. The Minister may be aware of the reason for this. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ole TIPIS: Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us put the records straight. As I said, the former Assistant Chief was paid his commuted pension gratuity of Shs.33,677.50. This amount is supported by this letter, which I have beforeme here, from the Treasury and which forwarded the cheque involved to the former Assistant Chief. Secondly, as of now, he have been receiving all along from 1st January, 1983,  a monthly pension of Shs.607.30 uptodate. The last payment of Mr. Muganda's dues for September, 1987 was collected by him on 6th October, 1987. The month of October, 1987 is not over yet, and he will receive his dues for this month as usual. </Newspeech> <i> Qustion No.444 </i>MR.arap LKOSKE asked the Minister of State, Office of the President:(a)	whether he is aware that the family of the late to Assistant Chief Mr. Francis Maina Chemis of Cheptalal Village, Kericho District, has not been paid death gratuity since the deceased passed away in 1979;(b)	why the Ministry has failed to reply to the letter written by the Principal Pensions Officer ref. No.APNGC 25378 dated 17th April, 1986 regarding thedues of the family of the deceased; and.(c)	when they will be paid.<Newspeech>THE MINISTER OF STATE, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. ole Tipis): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(a)	The family of the late Maina Chemis, has already been paid death gratuity dues by the Principal Pensions Officer amounting to SHS.13,426.90 only through the Public Trustee on 10th June, 1987.(b)	The letter in question, Ref . No. APNGC 25378 dated 17th April, 1986 was not received in my office.(c)	Arising from my reply to part (a), part (c) of thisQuestion does not arise. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. arap KOSKE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while thanking the Minister for having taken action the matter and paid the complainants, can he explain to the House as to why this money had to be retained for more than eight years in the Treasury? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ole TIPIS: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the late Mr. Maina Chemis died on 31st March, 1979. The delay of the payment of death gratuity benefits was occasined by the delay in the submission of the last pay slip of the deceased by the dependants which was required by the Principal Pensions Officer.Let me, through you Mr. Speaker, Sir, assure my hon. friend that in that particular year there was a big bottleneck somewhere and we have been ordered, and we are complying with those orders, to speed  things up and as of now, that bottleneck does not any longer exist. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.arap KOSKE: Mr. Speaker, I Sir, can the Minister agree or disgree with the fact that it is an offence to keep money for that length of time, particularly, without paying any interest on it? If he agrees to that, can he consider paying some interestto the complainants because they have stayed without money for allthat length of time? Has this money just been lying idle somewhereOr has it been in use? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. olo TIPIS: Mr. Speaker, Sir, Imade it categoricallyclear that the cause of delay was due to the dependants of the deceased failing to submit the information required by the Treasury in time.So, you cannot point a finger at the Government. When they submittedthis information, the claim was immediately settled. </Newspeech><i> Question No.608 </i>MR. MUTHURA asked the Minister for Cooperative Development where since cooperative activities havecould progressively Increased in Laikipia District, hepost Cooperative Officers to Ngarua, Rumuruti,Central and Mukogodo Divisions.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR COOPERATIVE DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Ejore): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.Currently there is no urgent, need to establish divisional offices at Ngarua, Rumuruti and Mukogogo because the two offices, that is, the District Headquarters at Nanyuki and the Divisional Head quaters at Nyahururu are rendering adequate services to all co  operative societies in the District.The Ministry will, however, consider sending additional staff to the District as soon as it is considered necessary. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.MUTHURA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the last part of the Assistant Minister's reply says that the Ministry will post more staff if they find it necessary. Does he not find it necessary to send officers and possibly open an office at Ngaru DivisionalHeadquarters when he knows that  the people from that area are served by the District Cooperative Officer in Nyandarua who does not belong to Laikipia District? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EJORE: Mr.Speaker, Sir, some of the societies in this division are not active. If the hon. Member could listen me very carefully, I will give him the following information: Ngarua Division has one active society and NINO dormant societies; Rumuruti Division has seven active societies and four dormant ones, Central Division has 18 active and eight dormant societies and MukoandoDivision has no active society, but has onewhich is dormant.As soon as the nature of the work calls for additional staff, then the Ministry will consider posting them to the district. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.MUTHURA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have two categories of cooperative societies, marketing and savings societies. To which class does the breakdown given by the Assistant Minister refer? Is it to the marketing or savings cooperative societies? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EJORE: The marketing cooperative societies, Mr. Speaker,Sir. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BORU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, arising from that reply givenby the Assistant Minister, in the records he was giving, it showsthat most of the cooperative societies there are dormant. Whycould he not send officers there to revive those dormant societies? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EJORE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the officers in NyahururuHeadquarters go to these places every day to give encouragement tothe farmers. The hon. Member could also help by encouraging the farmers to work harder so that they elevate the standard of their societies. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTHURA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, transport is a touchy problem in this country, and if these officers travel from Nyahururu to Ngarua everyday, which is about 40 kilometres to and fro, does the Assistant Minister not find this more expensive than stationing these officers at either Ngarua or Rumuruti? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EJORE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, transport has now been arranged by the Ministry and those officers will get transportfacilities as soon as possible. </Newspeech><i> Question NO. 596 </i>MR.KILIKU asked the Minister for Cooperative Development:(a)	whether he is aware that the members of Usiku Savings and Credit Co—operative Society under Kenya Union of Savings and Credit Cooperative Societies (KUSCC0) of P.O. Box 85113, Mombasa have not been paid any dividends since 1975? and(b)	when they will be paid.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR COOPERATIVE DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Ejore): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(a)	It is not true that the members of Usiku Savings and Credit Cooperative Society under ICUSCCO Have not been paid since 1975.(b)	During the years 1975 arid 1980, there were no dividends available for distribution due to lack of surplus.However, in July, 1987, a total of shs.14,872.45 was distri¬buted to the members of Usiku Savings and. Credit Cooperative Society being dividends for the years 198l to 1984.The books for the year 198586 have not yet been audited. MR. KILIKU: Mr.Speaker, Sir, according to that reply given by the Assistant Minister, it appears that members of Usiku Savings and Credit Cooperative Society received their dividends for the years 1981 to 1984 in July this year. Could the Assistant Minister tell this House why they delayed the payments for six years? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.EJORE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is because the amount during the year 1984, for the members of Usiku Savings and Credit Cooperative Society stood at SHS.2,033= with a share capital of shs. 559,109— Between the years 1975 to 1980. the society did not realise any surplus from its activities. Therefore, no money was available for distribution in form of dividends.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, during 1951, 1982, 1983 and 1984 the following amounts were duly approved for distribution vide the Commissioner's letter Ref. CS2377VOL.l (62) as follows:1981                             1982         19831984Shs.3, 592.00    Shs.4, 177.00         shs.633.00 Shs.6,520.00</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

Lakini mnamo mwaka wa 1982, Serikali iliichukaa barabara hiyo na ikaiweka katika orodha ya barabara nyingine zinazohudumiwa na Serikali, yaani classified roads.(c)	Serikali ilifungua kilomita 10 ikitumia grader kwa vile lakini barabara hii inapitia sehemu yenye milima na mawe kazi ya kuifungua barabara hii zaidi .ilisimamishwa. Hii ni kvva sababu kazi hiyo ilikuwa inagharimu pesa nyingi na pi a kulikuwa kunatakikana mashine kubwa yaani, bulldozer. Pia ilikuwa ni lazima kujengwe mifereji ya chini kwa chini ya kuchukua maji kutoka upande moja wa barabara hadi ule mwingine. Mifereji ya aina hii hujiilikana kama box culverts.Ofisa anayesimamia barabara wilayani Taita Taveta ameamriwakutwaa mashine kubwa na kuifungua barabara hii upesi iwezekanavy. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

On 4th Marc 1985, Guram & Company Advocates entered appearance for the defendant company, Kenya Bus Services limited and the driver Thomas Makori Onentia.  a  defence on 27th March, 1985,  denying negligence on the part of the driver of the company.  By consent of both advocates representatives, the    case was fixed for hearing for 9th and 10th July, 1986 and before these dates the advocates: for the plaintiffs applied to court for the cesc to be transferred to the Senior Resident Magistrate’s Court at Sheria House. The application was fixed for hearing and the same was granted. on 19th July, 1986. The matter was then transferred to Sheria House where it was assigned and a number given.  It was listed for hearing on 24th April and later, on the 9th June, 1987, but on both, occasions, by consent of both parties stood over the matter generally.(b) You can see, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that there is no further blame which can be attached to the court.

Spika, nitachunguza marobo hayo na nitaleta majibu baadaye. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR COMMERCE (Prof. Ng'eno); On a point of order. Mr. Speaker, Sir. I have two points of order to make. The first one relates to the Ministerial Statement I undertook to make sometimes this week. Unfortu¬nately, yesterday I was not in Nairobi and that is why I could not make that statement. Sometimes early this year, newspaper reports indicated that imported tissue paper was being sold in some supermarkets in Mombasa. As a result of this revelation, the District Trade Development Officer, Mombasa, was instructed, in consultation with the Import and Export Officer in Customs Department, to undertake a quick survey to establish how these goods came to land in Kenya market. Investigations were finalised in May and my office took the opportunity to check the situation in Nairobi and found out that there m were no imported tissue rolls in Nairobi. However, my officers in Mombasa confirmed that only one supermarket was selling imported toilet paper. This supermarket is known as Omee's. It was also revealed that Omee's Supermarket bought their consignment from the Department of Customs and Excise open auctions on 13th January, 1987. In effect, they were selling foods which were auctioned because they had been imported illegally.My second point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir, relates to the question raised by hon. Shikuku in June. Hon. Shikuku wanted to know if I had implemented the Government statement to the effect that all clearing and forwarding companies should be run by and large by Kenyans of African origin. I now have the pleasure to submit a list of registered companies with at least 51 per cent shareholding by Kenyans which includes the names of directors or partners and distribution of shares.I am afraid,Sir, the list is very long but since this is a very important matter, I will read a few names. </Newspeech> These conroanies are as follows : DircctorsFartnerShares Held, b KenyansLiccncee's llamapr3 A  (1 > £ £ £Remarks   1.

It comprises 356 companies. With your permission, Sir, I beg to lay this list on the Table. </Newspeech>(Prof. Ng’eno laid the list on the Table), <Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir, My point of order, is on the poor distribution of the Party newspaper, that is, Kenya Times and Kenya Leo. In my constituency, the vendor at Kianjai Market has been refused to sell Kenya Times and Kenya Leo. For example, when we as leaders meet at the DivisionalHeadquarters, when .we want to buy this newspaper at Kianjai Market, we never have  access to it at all. People in that Market and the surrounding areas have noaccess to the Party newspapereven when we have no meetings. The vendor in that market says that he has been: refused to sell the Party newspaper by whoever distri¬butes it in Meru town. It is common knowledge that this paper arrives in certain town later than other newspapers when people have already bought the other newspapers and sa read them. WE have been complaining and urging our people to buy the Kenya Times . The Kenya Times should be carefull when reporting Members of this House and party leaders. This is because they do not report what every hon. Member says in this House. Of late, they have been trying to choose the hon. Members they would like to report. The Standard and the Daily Nations, may, for example, report what hon. Members have said but the Kenya Times tends to choose on certain individuals that they would like to cover. The Party newspaper must be more careful. Our electors rant to read what we have said in all the newspapers but when they seeithat a particular newspaper is not reporting what their representative said, then ever if you tell them to buy that newspaper, they will not do so and that is a loss?of revenue to the Party newspapers.I do not know to whom I should complain. I thought in this House there are important people leading the Party I can see the VicePresidentand Minister for Home Affairs is here: hon ole Tipis was here "but has just gone out. This must he corrected. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE VICEPRESIDENT AND MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. KIbaki): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Although it is not Question Time, Sir, certainly we know that it is 'a policy of the Kenya Tines and Kenya Leo that they will report all news that is suitable to he reported. I can assure the House that there axe no directives as to who should and who should not be reported.. Newspaper editors and reporters do operate as freely as those others in any other newspaper, we know that in order a to succeed as a "business we have to be competitive with those that are in that field. Therefore, I can assure the hon. Member that there will be no instructions from the Party as to what and whom they may report.On the other hand, I can undertake to investigate the particular business matter which was raised, namely; that somebody somewhere is denying a subdistributor access to the Party newspaper. If this is so, then that kind of distributor would be  unsuitable for us. we want somebody who would encourage wider distribution. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER,OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Onyancha): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. On the 8th of this month while I was responding to a Question raised by hon. Mbori, I promised to lay on this Table Minutes of the Oyugis Health Center Development Committee as per his request. I wish to  fulfil my promise by laying these Minutes (Mr. Onyancha laid the Minutes on the Table) </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. GITHUA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, my point of order is in connection with the just concluded Kenyatta Day celebrations, on 20th October, 1987. In Nyeri District, where I, the NyeriMayor, the Chairman of  the County Council of Nyeri and other leaders were present; the Provincial Commissioner, Central Province, Mr. Etemesi explained to us and to the public that he had instructions from Kanu headquarters that only the District Kanu Chairman would address the public in response to the Presidential speech. He said it very clearly, that he had the instructions in writing. While I do not doubt that the Provincial Commissioner may have had those instructions I noticed the following day from the papers, and from the Voice of Kenya that in other di strie ts|Members of Parliament.who are not necessarily chairmen of Kanu, £ councillors; and other leaders were accorded the opportunity to address the public.(applause)My worry is whether those instructions from Kanu headquarters were only to apply in Nyeri District.If  was so I wantto request the Minister of State incharge of Provincial Administration or incharge of kanu affairs for that matter to make a statement  in this house to explain the motive behind those kinds of instructions. Situations like that one would create hard feelings between elected leaders, the provincial administration, and the publicThank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. </Newspeech><Header>  COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY </Header>(Order for Committee read being  11the Allotted Day) <Header>  MOTION </Header>That Mr. Speaker do now leave the Chair Vote 12Ministry of Local Government <Newspeech>THEMINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Sir. Mudavadi): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to move that Mr. Speaker do now leave the Chair.Mr. Speaker, Sir, my Ministry is responsible for guiding, controlling, and coordinating the activities and functions of local authorities within the framework of Central Government policies,The Ministry intends to spend k£6,106,930 net,'forrecurrent expenses and k£4,167, 750 net on development projects, The corresponding gross figures are k£6, 236,030 j' and k£9,157,125 respectively with the k£129, £00, and  k£4,989, 375jf being AppropriationsinAid.Mr.Speaker, Sir, I would like to begin with the  Recurrent Vote which provides the funds required for salaries and general administration expenses of the Ministry, as well as contributions in lieu of rates and grants payable to local authorities.Hon. Members will  note that the provision for subvote. 120General Administration (Headquarters and Provincial Services) had gone down from K£6,553,500 last year to K£6,106,930 this year. This decrease is partly explained by nonallocation of any funds  to pay off arrears of contributions in lieu of rates especially to the Nairobi City Commission  which is now owed more than K£7 million.The subvote  122 Contributions in Lieu of Rateshas gone up slightly from k£4,600,000 last year to K£4,740,790 this year an increase of only K£140.790. The net result is that this allocation can hardly meet the normal claims from local authorities and arrears will continue to accumulate.Mr. Speaker, Sir, contributions in lieu of rates are statutory payments under the Rating Act (Cap 267) and the Govern¬ment is dutybound to meet them. It is,'therefore, necessary to reexamine this matter in future in order to comply with the law.Under subvote 124Grants to Needy Local Authorities  my ministry is asking for K£350,000 for assisting to some extent, the councils financially unstable on account of climatic conditions and other circumstances beyond their control. Our basic policy, however, remains one of helping such councils to develop to the level where such grants would become unnecessary. We are determined to strengthen the financial base of all the local authorities so that they can provide more satisfactory services.Turning to the Development Expenditure, the Ministry is requesting a gross sum of  K£9,957,127 for the year 198788, These funds are intended for the development of infrastructure withindifferent urban areas of the Republic. Hon. Members will appreciate that Kenya's urban population is growing at a rate higher than that of the  country's population as re a whole and there is need to keep on expanding infrastructural services.Mr. Speaker, although the Government is making everyeffort to improve the quality of life in the rural areas, migration into towns is expected to continue. At the end of this century, our urban population could hit the nine to 10 million mark, making the urban population in Kenya 26 or 27 percent of     Mr. Speaker, hon. Members will note that the DevelopmentEstimates have not  exceeded the 198687 level, despite our commitment to try and meet the expanding needs of the urban popu¬lation. The gross estimates for last year were K£9,240}000 as Our external receipts are broken down as follows: Pull grants issued as revenueK£500,000. Full grants issued as appropriationsinaidK£630,625.Loans issued  as revenueK£l,232,200. Loans issued as appropriations inaidK£4,358,750.I would now like to turn to the specific programmes and projects under the Local Authorities Sewage . Schemes. My gross expenditure allocation has slightly gone up from K£3f075,906 during the previous financial year, to K£3,750,000 during the current financial year. This small increase in the allocation to this very important sector is very much appreciated. Nevertheless, I EH should like to point out that it is too little to enable us to expand sewage services to the new and fast growing towns.The developnent strategy outlined in the Sessional Paper No. 1 of 1986 on Economic Management for renewed growth hinges crucially on avoiding the concentration of population in Nairobi and Mombasa and shifting towards the vigorous  growth, of secondary and smaller  urban centres throughout the Republic.Mr. Speaker, Sir, in my budget, I have attempted to move the sectoral services into these secondary towns.These include among others: Murang'a Kisii, Bangoma, Thika, Nyahururu and Nyeri Municipal councils. Also included are HomaBay? Isiolo, Busia and Naivasha town councils. All these projects are financed through different financial agencies and arrangements for example, Murang’a, Kisii, Bungoma, Thika and Nyeri municipalities sewerage systems are currently financed through a loan provided by both the African Development Bank and the African Development Fund. On the other handy Nyahururu, HomaBay, Isiolo and Busia town councils sewerage systems now under construction are financed through a full grant provided by Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA).Sir? as hon. Members are undoubtedly aware it is a declared Government policy to provide clean and treated water to all citizens of this country by the year 2000. It is our intention as a Ministry to play a significant role towards the achievement of this goal. We have a number of water supply schemes which we would like to see constructed under the councils. We have completed a study on water supply projects in many local authorities and we are ready to embark on the implementation of some of them These include, among others; Nairobi Kericho Kisumu Eldoret and Thika Water Projects. In order to be able to carry on with the implementation work so as to provide clean and treated water  for the people catered for by these councils. we will require an allocation of higher figure to this sector alone in the future.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the programme for local authorities roads maintenance is one area which sometimes has attracted considerable debate in this House. I need not go into details, Mr. Speaker, because all that ought really to be said about the state of roads within some of our Municipalities has already been said and it is common knowledge today.Hon. Members, however, should note that there are no Treasury allocations to this sector. The local authorities have been left with, virtually nothing and will find it very difficult to construct new roads or even maintain the existing ones. Mr. Speaker, unless local authorities are able to raise funds from other sources, the roads are likely to get worse as time passes.The local authorities housing and building sector, including tho small town shelters, has so far progressed quite well. The second and third urban, projects are financed through a loan agreement between the Government of Kenya and the World Bank. The second urban project is now coming to an end. The World Bank disbursementsto the project have  ceased, but small project components which are not yet completed have to be financed between the Treasury and the local authorities. Theseprogrammes are intended to provide housing infrastructure and community facilitiesin the major urban centres and shelters for the growing urban areas.which I have already mentioned above.Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is an item in my Budget referred to only as "Miscellaneous Programmes", not that it is any less important; it is very important. I have the following projects under this heading: municipal council markets, transportation study project, refuse collection project, vipingo slaughterhouse, land acquisition, fire fighting equipment and wholesale market proposed. Under the item of municipal council markets, Mr. Speaker, we are currently constructing . a huge wholesale market in Mombasa, through a loan arrangement between the KFW of West German and the Government of Kenya, for a sum of K£2,450,000. The construc¬tion of this market is at a very advanced stage and I must say it is about to be completed. The problem currently being experienced at MwembeTayari Market in Mombasa should be a thing of the past when this market starts to operate.Mr. Speaker, Sir, plans are also underway to construct similar marketswithin the Municipality " of Kisumu and in Nairobi Tho wholesale market proposed to be built in Nairobi, when completed, should relieve the congestion problems currently being experienced, at the Wakulima Markets while the market proposed to be built at Kisuura should eater for horticultural produce in the whole of western Kenya.The urban transportation study is intended to provide a longterm solution to the transportation problem currently being experienced in Nairobi and in other major urban centres. The study is well underway, and the first stage of the study has already been completed. The first part of the study has made recommendations for suitable transportation systems which could be adopted in "the city of Nairobi. The second stage of the study should focus on whichever system "the Government decides to adopt. Mr. Speakers Sir, this, together with the introduction of the National Youth Service Bus System, should go along way towards alleviating the transportation problem currently being experienced in the City of Nairobi and in other urban centres.Mr. Speaker, Sir, turning to the firefighting equipment and the refuse collection projects, these are two very important priorities. We all know, Sir, That fires have caused untold damage in this country and it is time we prepared ourselves to fight them more effectively. On the other hand, Mr. Speaker, uncollected garbageis both an eyesore and more important, a real, health hazard. The proposed project is intended to deal with this problem adequately. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the refuse collection project is intended to supply refuse collection equipment and maintenance facilities in our local authorities. First, we have made arrangements for "theEldoret and Nakuru Municipalities to have later this year, refuse collection vehicles.Later on, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we shall move on to Nairobi and other large municipalities.We are,at the moment, in the procoss of negotiating an agreement with the Italian Government to finance the whole of "this project.:Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government of the United Kingdom has already supplied fire fighting equipment to nine country councils on a Full grant basis.We are grateful for this generosity, but our expanding needs arefar from being met. As a result, we have therefore, made requests for more equipment from the government of Britain, particularly for both Nairobi and Mombasa municipalities which are badly off at the moment.Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of these projects require land in order to be implemented. There may be money, but then, there is that question of land.'. We have,therefore, put aside some money for this purpose. Currently, the resources we have reserved for this purpose are not adequate for all the land required in my ever increasing urban centres, especially for Nairobi water supply. We have been able to acquire land and we are able to pay for it in so that Chania Phase III may commence.Mr. Speaker, Sir, with these few remarks, and since my. Mini s try does not  take a lot of money, I  therefore, beg to move that  Votes R. 12 and D.12 covering my Estimates be approved by this august House. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to move. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr.Biwott): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second and  reserve my rightto speak at a later stage.With those few remarks I beg to second. </Newspeech>(Question proposed)<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR COMMERCE (Mr. Lalampaa): Ahsantesana B.v.

Spika,  nasema hoyo kwa sababu nimekuwa na ujuzi mwingi sana kwa Serikali za Wilaya. Kabla sijaingia Bunge milikuwa diwani na mwenyekiti wa barzaa la wilaya kwa miaka kumi. Kwa hivyo, naelew? sana Serikali za Wilaya.Bw. Spika, ni juu ya. Wizara hii ya Serikali za Wilaya kuhaki kisha kwamba magari ya Serikali za Wilaya yanakaguliwa vile vile na Government Check Unit ili n.aofisa wa Serikali za Wilaya na vile vile wenyeviti na.madiwani wasije wakajatumia magari ya Serikali za Wilaya kwa rijia mbaya au kwa njia ambayo si rasnii. Vile vile yafaa magari haya yaangaliwe au jakaguliwe sawa sawa na magari ya Serikali, yaani Government of Kenya Vehicles (G.K.'s). Jambo hilo vile vile lina stahili kufanywa.Jambo lingine, Bw. Spika, ambalo ningependa kupendekeza kwa Wizara ya Serikali za Wilaya hi kutoa seminars lcva ma diwani ili wajue roho zao ili wasije wakagongana na wale maofisa ambao wame ajiriwa na Serikali za Wilaya. Hii ni kwa.sababu wasipoelezwa na kufundishwa wa j ibu wao kama madiwani, basi wataingilia kazi ya utawal ya Serikali za Wilaya. Ingefaa waelewe kazi yao ni kutoa mwenedo, yaani to formulate policy. Huo ndio wajibu wao, j'aani kutunga sheria za Serikali za Wilaya, na vile vile kuyapendekeza mambo ambayo yana hitajika kufanyika na Serikali za Wilaya0 Pia,,rafaa wawaachilie wale maofisa ambao wameajiriwa na Serikali za Wilaya watekeleze mambo hayo, yaani implementing officers to be executives na siyo madiwani.kwa sababu watakuja kugombana. Njia mo ja va kufanya hivyo ni wao..kuwa na seminar ya Icuelezwa kazi yao ni ipi na pia kazi ya executive officers.ni jnini.Bw. Spika, jambo lingine ni kwamba kwa vile tunaelekea karibu na uchaguzi, basi tungemuuliza Waziri wa Serikali za Wilaya kuhaki kisha kwamba kila ibarafa itakuwa na diwani kwa sababu hapo awali</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR COMMERCE (Mr. Lalampaa)(Contd.): kulikuwa na lokeshcni nyingine ambazo ziligawanjwa lakini bado diwani. mmoja ndiye alil uwa anasimamia karibu lolcesheni nibili. Kwa uchaguzi ujoo tunamuomba Waziri ahakiicishs kwamba kila lokesheni ina div.ani mmoja ar.baye amechaguliwa na waiianchi.. Pia, tunajua kwamba madiwani wateule hawawezi kuwa zaidi ya theluthi moja (onethird) ya madiwani ambao wamechaguliwa„ Basi, jambo bora ambalo Wizara ingefikiria wakati wa uchaguzi ni kuhakiki sha kwamba kila sehemu imewakilishwa. Ikiwa wilaya moja itakuwa na madiwani sita au kumi wa kuteuliwa, yafaa wahakikishe kwamba kila sehemu imewakilishwa. Ikiwa baraza moja la konseli fulani lina mawakilisho matatu h.ivi, siyo vizuri kuwa madiwani wa kuteuliwa watoke sehemu moja au mawakilisho moja. Najua kwamba mawakilisho yote matatu yatapata faida lcutokana na madiwani wateule ili tuhakikishe kwamba wananchi wamewakilishwa vizuri.Kwa hayo machache, Bw. Spika, naunga mkono. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KOSKE: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me an opportunity also to make some contributions to this Vote.First of all, I would like to thank the Minister for Local Government for the work he has done together with members of staff  A councillor in an area is one of the most important men in the loca¬lities, and being one of the leaders, he is expected to live in a manner that makes a good example to the rest. But at the moment, the allowances given to them with the number of fundraising meetings they have to attend to, they are unable to be presentable to wananchi0 I would like to urge the Government to see to it that these allowances are improved so that these people may display better examples; to wananchiMr. Speaker, Sir, some of the wards are far too large that some of the councillors manning those areas are unable to attend to the people and also unable to attend to the various projects which are going on in those areas. Therefore, I would like to urge the Governmentto see to it that loan facilities arc jv.ade easier for them so that they can even afford to run motorcycles. Again, I would like to support hen. Lalampaa on the idea that each location should have itsown councilor. Not only that. Some of the wards in some areas are far too large that to be manned by one councillor is also very diffi¬cult. I would urge the Government to see to it that in such areas they should be given more wards so that they may have more councillors to represent such areas,Mr. Speaker, Sir, Ave also have some unclassified roads. Most of them go to schools, and others to some small market centres. Some of the bridges along these roads got broken some time ago,  The Mini¬stry of Transport and Communications only deals with classified roads, So I think these roads remain for the councils to take care of them But I am afraid that the councils ven like minedonot have money to do so  Therefore, I urge the Government to see to it that mp re money should be given to this Ministry so that it may manage to maintain some of these small roads which are not classified, but which are very important.Mr, Speaker, Sir, I think it is pathetic for a school to be in a place where communication is difficult. We all know the activities which are done in school, including games and so on. Sometimes ifthere is an accident,  a child has fallen down and broken a leg or something else, it is pathetic that some of those schools cannot be reached by vehicles. Even now, the children have to carry milk and school equipment from some distance because vehicles cannot reach there.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the nursery schools also should have teachers, I think the councils or the Local Government should be given enough money to manage to employ good teachers, or well educated, or qualified teachers to man the nursery schools in the country. Meanwhile, some K. 4 – 22. 10. 87of the nursery schools are manned by very, very poor teachers who have never had a chance to learn well, and who cannot even be trained because they are very low educationally. I do not see the reason why the councils cannot take over such schools and see that the activities done there are good.Mr. Speaker, Sir, when I was inspector of schools, several times I visited nursery schools and found that what was being taught was very irrelevant to what should have been happening there. Somebody is sent to a school only to spoil children by trying to teach the primary school syllabus instead of teaching what is supposed to be taught in nursery schools. So, since not all parents are educated enough to be able to realise the effects of teaching a young child the wrong thing, I urge that ,all nursery schools be taken over by the local authorites. That is why I am advocating that the Government gives the councils more money so that they can taken over running of nursery schools.Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said, teachers in nursery schools should be trained; and places should be increased so that we do have nursery school teachers teaching for a long time in a nursery school without being trained. WE would like them to give a sound guidance to our young children.Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of the municipal and town councils in the country, particularly those in my constituency in Kericho District, are not clean enough. Some of them do not even have toilets. Even those which have got them, the toilets are very poorly maintained. When something goes wrong with them, it takes time before any action is taken. I think this happens because of lack of money. So, these toilets and other facilities should be provided together with enough money to maintain them.Mr. Speaker, Sir, another thing that I would like to remind the government is that facilities which were given to local authorities some back are no longer enoughdue to the increasing population towns. Even in some towns WE HAVE WATER problems.Londian Township in my constituency, Kcricho District, is an example of a placewhere we have regular water problems: Kipkelion Town is another example even asI am talking here now this problem is being experienced in these places. Sometimes, revent schools within the towns are forced to go to rivers to look for water, because water in the towns is never enough. The Government should know that since these facilities were provided, things have changed a lot. So, I am now bringing these problems to attention of the government so that action can be taken.Mr. Speaker, sir, some plots have been allocated to people temporarily fortoo long. I would like the Government to speed up allocation of plots. A person should be told whether a plot is his or not his so that he can develop it, without any fear of being moved from it later. Plots which have not been surveyed should be surveyed and given to their owners so that they can begin developing them. In some towns, plots have remained undeveloped for a long time, because plots are allocated to people on a temporary basis, and so they are not keen on developing them. So, allocation of plots should be speeded up so that development can continue And while allocating plots, the local deserving wananchi should get the first priority. Even in places where, maybe, people are not yet interested in plots, they should still he considered. Plots should not be given to outsiders, because later on when the local people develop interest for plots, there will be none to give them. So, the local people should get the first priority in plot allocation. Also, during allocation, care should be taken to avoid discrimination. I have witnessed some cases where a person is given as many as seven plots, while another one has been applying for a plot for a long time, but he has not been given one. Yet what happens is that some people are given plots only to sell them later. People should only be given plots to develop and not to sell. I think if somebody is unable todevelop a plot, the Government should repossess it and give it to someone whois prepared to develop it. So, plots should not be given to people whoare probably, not prepared to develop them. This practice should not beallowed to continue and plots should be given to people who can develop them.With those few remarks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the Motion. </Newspeech> (Mr. Michoma stood up in his place)<Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Yes, Mr. Michoma. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.. MIOJIOKA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was just rising on a point of order in connexion with what my hon. colleague has said, that outsiders are given plots without specifying who those outsiders are, I just wanted him to tell us who those outsiders are. </Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: Asians</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KOSKE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think that that is very obvious. In most towns we have nonAfricans being given plots. In fact, that is even happening in Kisii town. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR WATER DEVELOPMENT (Archbishop Ondiek): Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to join my hon. brother to contribute to this very important Motion.Sir, I listened to the Minister for Local Government very carefully when he was moving his Vote, and I would like to give ay observations on nursery schools which are being run by county councils and municipalities. I have observed that the teachers in such nursery schools are not paid on time, despite the fact that we do realise that unless a teacher is paid on time he cannot be competent to man his work in the classroom. I would, therefore, like to urge the Minister, for Local Government to intervene in this matter so that the teachers of nursery schools under his Ministry axe paid properly and on time. AS you know, Sir, according to our education system, our children must pass through nursery schools. If there is no proper foundation in the nursery schools, our children's future will be totally ruined.Having said that, Sir, I would now like to touch on the revenues collected by county councils and municipal councils. While I agree with the Minister that his Ministry does not have enough revenue to enable it to run county councils and municipalities effectively, I would like to point out that there is a lot left to be desired in the way county councils and municipalities are being managed. There is lack of supervision in those areas in that whenever you meeteither county council or municipal council workers, they tell you that they have not been paid for oho last two years or so. Despite the fact that the workers are healthy and willing to do their work, they are never paid for almost two years. Since 110 receipts are issued to workers for the collection of rates, YOU find that most of the revenue collected by them does not reach the right places. I am sure that if the local authority workers are properly supervised, county councils or municipalities would not have any problem of money. Although we do pay rates, we do not exactly see any services being provided by either county councils or municipal councils in return, despite the fact that there are so many things where county councils and municipal councils can help wananchi with. Not a single day passes without county council and municipal council workers collecting fees from markets.Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you look at most of our markets, you will find that they are filthy and they have no toilet facilities. The money is being collected and misused and there are no services being rendered to the wananchi in return. I would like to request the Minister for Local Government to look into this matter so that, at least, the revenue which is collected from the innocent wananchi is properly used. Let wananchi benefit from the collection of that revenue, We do appreciate that the country councils and the municipal councils are doing an important job, but we would like to see some services being rendered to the wananchi. There is a very important market in my constituency called unguja which is very filthy. That place has no toilet facilities. There are other markets which do not even have pit latrines. This happens despite the fact that there are bylaws in the local authorities which take care of health services. I think something should be done to make this Unguja market cleaner.Mr. Speaker, Sir, turning to the question of the supervision of county council and municipal council workers, I would like to say that the senior officers employed by these local authorities should do their job properly. What after all, is their job? They should try to supervise their juniors so that thecollection of revenue and its use is taken care of properly. This is in line withthe principles of management. Although councillors axe the heads of our county,councils and municipalities, some of them lack the knowledge of how to manage theselocal authorities. First of all, most councillors are not being paid. Of course, we are in agreement that councillors are the heads of their respective councils, but they are never paid because of mismanagement of funds and because of lack of supervision of workers.When we talk about the maintenance of roads, especially in Nairobi City, I must thank His Excellency the President</Newspeech><Header>  QUORUM . </Header><Newspeech>DR. WAMEYO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The House has no quorum, despite the fact that there are no toilets in the markets. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Yes, there is no quorum. Ring the Division Bell. </Newspeech>(The Division Bell was rung)<Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: We have a quorum now. Continue, Archbishop Ondiek. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR WATER DEVELOPMENT (Archbishop Ondiek): Thank you, Mr.Speaker, Sir.Sir, before my hon. colleague raised the quorum issue, I was talking about the need for total management of our councils. I do appreciate that there are very competent officers who are supposed to manage our councils, but those officers should try to be earnest with their supervision and ensure that the revenue collected by councils is well taken care of.Mr. Speaker, Sir, we know that there are elected councillor to our county councils and municipalities but, because they do not get their payments in time, they are quite inefficient. They cannot be able to work without being paid. Sometimes ago, our elected councillors used to get grants but, since this grant was cut off due to some other financial difficulties, there should beanother method of ensuring that the councillors get their payments in time. That way, they will be able to monitor what is going on in their respective councils.Sir, touching on the elevation of our councils, I would like to point out that certain councils were elevated due to political reasons. In some areas, urban councils do not even have income sufficient to manage their councils even when they collect revenue from markets and other areas; that is not enough even to pay the max members of staff and the eon councillors. I have an urban council whose expenditure is about KShs.20,000 per month when the income can never be more than KShs.7,000 per month. How are they going to manage that urban council Mr. Speaker, Sir? Something should be done. We should try to look for ways and means to get funds which we can allocate to these urban councils so that they can function. We know such urban councils are there, they exist and they must be made to survive. The only way to make these urban councils survive is for the Minister for Local Government and his team to sit down and look for ways and means to get more funds. They should add more markets to these urban councils so that there is enough income for any of these particular urban councilsMr. Speaker, Sir, there are new wards, or new locations which were created recently. When the Minister will be giving his reply, I would like him to tell us when these new. locational areas will be made electoralwards.The wananchi would like to know this because, even in my consitituency, there is a location which was created in 1978. and, until now, it has never been gazetted as an electoral ward. We would be very, very grateful if this can be done. Mr.Speaker, Sir, my hon. Friend talked about the allocation of plots. We know the method which is being used in the allocation of plots,in Siaya district, previously they were trying to use the secret ballot method. Through the secret ballot system, anybody was given the plots; even a person who can never develop a plot was being given one. In fact, we complained to the chairman and I think the situation was rectified, but in future we would like to see that such things do not happen. Before they introduced the secret ballot system, they used to find out the financial status of a person before they could allocate a plot to him.This was to make sure that if he is given a plot he will be able to develop it within a certain period.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I urge the Minister to try to look into this matter and assist as much as possible. We also hope that the Government will try to look for ways and means of getting funds and avail them to the urban councils and municipalities sothat they can be able to maintain roads. At the momentthe roads at, Kisumu are impossible. The wananchi pay their rates to the urban councils and they may not know that the money that they pay is not enough.Mr. Speaker, Sir, with those few remarks, I beg to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. GACHANJA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to join my hon. Colleagues in saying something concerning this very, very important Ministry.Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we are all aware, the Ministry of Local Government is a very important. The Minister is asking this House to approve the use of well over £5 million. I am very grateful that the Minister is here; I know he is very concerned and he will take the relevant notes so that he can mend where the Ministry has gone wrong. This Ministry engulfs the cities the towns and so on. I am happy that the City Commission has taken keen interest in improving the water situation in the city. Before I criticise, let me give credit where it is due. The water situation in the city has improved. In Dagoretti constituency, for example, we had areas like Mutuini, Satellite and Gando which did not have water for very many years, and today there is plenty of water. So, I am very grateful to the people who are concerned with the supply of water.  Apart from some individual people in the City Commission who have got integrity, the City Commission has totally failed. The reason why I am saying this is that we are all aware that anybody who comes to Kenya is mainly interested in Nairobi;it  is the mirror,NO matter what we do elsewhere, Nairobi is the country's mirror. However, itis a total shame that the roads in this beautiful “City in the Sun” are a bigshameo. They are full of potholes, and there is no planning towards this end. even in the case of the existing roads, it is only now that the City Commission is starting to patch them up. We have roads which were tannacked way back when hon. Charles Rubia was the Mayor of Nairobi. I can quote an area like Kangeraiwhere most of the roads were tarmacked then. In Satelite Estate, too, most of the roads there were tannacked a long time ago. Today, those roads do not have even murram. The tarmac they had has been eaten away, their murram is also gone and only soil remains. We have to cry and beg that those roads be murramed. If you take the SateliteDagoretti Market Road Dagoretti Market is very important as, I think a supplies more meat than even Kenya Meat Commission itselfyou will see that it is impassable. As I said, it was tannacked many years back. So, there must be something wrong somewhere.The City Commission has Commissioners who have not been directed to take care of particular areas, and none Of them is responsible for anything. So, road care is a question of individuals. If the Director of City Civic Services, Mr. Shigoli, wants to take care of these roads, he could go round the city. The same applies to anybody in the City Commission who wants to take interest in the roads. However, there are no specific individuals to whom certain jobs are allocated and who are responsible for them. You cannot use the roads in a centre like Kawangware to go to Gating Village during the rainy season.Once, I was accompanied by the City Engineer and we went round these places. He told me, "You have been saying that the roads in Dagoretti are impassable and people have to be transported on shoulders when it rains. Show me where these roads are." We went to Gatina, but we had to walk three miles because the car could not go any further. So, the Minister, in his goodwill I know that he is interested in these roads and that he has this country at heart should go deep into this matter and check on what the City Commissionis doing and what improvement, if any, it has made short of worsening this city.The schools in this beautiful city, too, are another shame. These schools were built when we had a mayor and councillors here, We have such schools as mukarara, Gitiba, kagira and Rumithitu which are in a very bad state. They have not been painted for the last decade and some of their roofs are leaking. If you go to Rumithitu School and look at the teachers' houses there, you will see that not even a labourer or anybody else can occupy because they are in a very bad condition. In this connection, I would like the Minister to think deeply so that when he comes to answer, he may tell us howmuch of these millions of shillings is going to be allocated to Dagoretti Constituency. I am very much interested in this issue.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the health centres in my constituency are no betterthank donkey sheds and I have said this before in this House. The curtains used there are pieces of gunny bags. I know that the Minister concerned was once in Kangemi. I do not know whether he chanced to visit the health centre there. This health centre is a big shame, and I would hate to see any visitor coming to visit Kangemi ana Kawangware Health Centres. The Minister has said that the Ministry is going to do something about these centres and expand them when funds are available. We do not know when these funds are going to be available, and I am worried about it. I hope that the Minister is going to say that in this present budget, seme of the money he has been promising to come to Dagoretti is available.Land owners in Dagoretti have not been given the land by the Government. This is freehold land, and yet these people axe paying rates for pupported services which they have never received. The Minister concerned wants somebody to pay rates because of roads, and yet those roads are impassable.It is not possible to “have your cake and eat it.” The minister should decide whether to render the necessary services, or withdraw the collection of rates. with those few remarks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS AND SETTLEMENT (mr.Karume): Ahsantc saNa, Spika, jcwa kunipatia nafasi hii ili nami niyaseme machache.Uisara ya Serikali WILAYA ni inojawax>o ya zile ambazo zime jitrjiibulioha kabisakwa uan?.nc:ii wa aaahanbanio Ivinafurahi na ninasnshukuru Vfaziri wa Seri):ali za VVVr (A1taa kwa sababu hivi majuzi aliuondoa ushuru uliotozwa kahawaambao ulikuwaukiwaumiza wakulinia va kahawa sana Wakulima hawa walikuwa wakilipa ushuru wa asilinia tatu, lakini sasa ushuru huu umepunguzwa ukawa asilimia moja0 Uaziri aliongeza ushuru unaotczwa miwa, mahindi na .'nirr.ea raingineo Fingemwomba vJaziri aliangalie jambo hili zaidi kwa sababu naona kwamba labda kuna zao noja  lililosahauliwa, nalo ni s&nanasio Kananasi hukuzwa sana hasa katika Thika, na tunajua kwamba yanaleta 'pesa nyingi za kigeni ]cwa sabalju mengi yake huuzwa ng'amboo Ingefaa tufikiri kuyatoza mananasi ushuru kama tunavyofanya na mime a mingina kama mahindio Ingefaa tuone kwamba Serikali za aa. siraepata ushuru kiasi fulani kutokana najmananasioEatujasema kuwa hatutaki kutozwa ushuru? lal:ini mara. nyingine walculima hunung'unilca wakiserna kwamba ushuru huu haufai kwa sababu wanapoutozwa hawaoni unafanyiwa nini.

SPEAKER: Yes, Mr. Michoma. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MICHOMA: Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me this chance to join my colleagues in supporting this Motion</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUNYAO: I knew</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. SPEAKER: Order What did you say, Mr. Munyao?Just because I called somebody else, you said "I knew" and you repeated it? You did not even let me finish. </Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MUNYAO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it must have been a slip of the tounge. I was looking at my colleague whom I was talking to. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: You better be careful, Mr. Munyao. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MICHOMA: Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would first of all want to congratulate the Minister for the manner in which he has handled the affairs of the Ministry of Local Government. This is a very important Ministry and the Minister has done his best but in some other various occasions, he has been failed by councillors and chief officers of the councils. I would also like to mention that the Local Government Regulations of 1986, revised edition, have not been followed strictly by most councils because these regulations stipulate that councillors have been given powers to administer financial matters and to make bylaws.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Minister has done well in certain councils because ho has effected the transfers of the chief officers tc work in other councils. However it seems as though the Minister has not completed the exercise. I would like the Minister to effect transfers of all chief officers of all county councils, municipal council, urban councils and so on. It is not fair for the Minister to effect transfers in certain municipalities and county councils and leave others. I hope that the Minister will do that. He know that I am very sincere in what I am saying; I AM happy with his job and he should, therefore, effect this so that these chief officers should not be agents of certain politicians in certain areas.I would like to remind the Minister, through you, Sir, that mayors, clerks and chairmen of councils go out of their boundaries wearing their gowns. The law stipulates this very clearly. For exainple, Sir, you find the mayor going outside his boundary wearing the gown. This also applies to county council clerks. This can only be done only under very special occasions, say, when His Excellency the President is visiting a certain area and, perhaps, they want to meet him at the boundary of a certain district. It is not fair for them to fly flags on their cars outside their boundaries.Secondly, the Minister should assist municipal councils, such as, Kisii, Kakamega and so on by giving them fire brigade vehicles. I am saying thisbecause houses in Kisii, Kakamega, Kericho and so on normally catch fire.For example, there is no fire brigade vehicle in Kisii Municipality. I wouldlike the Minister to assist these municipalities. Last time, Sir, the Ministerreceived vehicles and they were despatched to Kisumu and elsewhere but Kisii,Kericho and Kakamega did not receive any, I am citing this example, I hope the Minister is listening because we would like to have uniformity in the distribution of Government grants. These grants should be spread to all municipalities. I know that the Minister does not favour his own district. I would like the Minister to take serious note of this so that when he getsaid from donors, he may consider these areas.I would like to say that in certain municipalities, particularly Kisii,most markets do not have latrines; they do not have even a single latrine.This is a shame because councils do get revenue frora wananchi. I would liketo urge the Minister to consider allowing Bobaracho and Nyaora Wards of KisiiMunicipality to have two councillors each. Those wards are unusually largeand I think that the Minister should take note of this. Members of thoseareas feel that those areas should be considered.I would like to touch on the question of elevation of towns to urban and town councils and eventually to municipalities. I know that this was done hurriedlyelsewhere and there was no consideration of funds. These councils do not havefunds whatsoever. In 1969 when the Central Government took over three majorservices; namely, education, health and roads, the councils works was seenby the wananchi. Now, we do not see what the councils are doing. It is nottheir fault because the little money, they get from coffee cess and elsewhere,is used for paying salaries. This is not fair to coffee farmers, Mr.Speaker, Sir. Coffee farmers have been paying cess over the years. I would like to thank the Government, through the Minister and through you, Sir, forrreducing the coffee cess from 3 per cent to 1 per cent. Still, coffee farmers feel that the councils are not doing enough. Coffee farmers should be exempted from paying cess because they have been doing so over the years while farmers of other crops were not paying cess.I would like to touch on roads leading to coffee factories. The council should oversee these roads. At the moment, they are not doing anything at all.The other point relates to electricity to coffee factories. The councils should assist in this way because they are getting money from coffee cess but they are not doing so.The other point I would like to make is in relation to the mismanagement of funds in local authorities. The Minister should be tough on this. We will and are suppoting him to make sure that there is NO loss of funds inlocal authorities. Perhaps, auditor and inspectors from the Ministry are notenough and I think the Minister should get more staff from other departments and deploy them in local authorities. This is because certain local authorities have lost funds and nothing has been done.The other thing I would like to say is on nomination of councillors. When Members of Parliament go to the Minister to see him on the question of nomination of councillors, he should say "No." Why should one Member ofParliament in a given area nominate all councillors withcut consulting otherMembers of Parliament in tnat area? This is a serious matter and I know the Minister knows what I am talking about. For example, it is not fair when hon. Shikuku let me use yourname because I know youwho comes from Kakamega District gives the Minister a list of names of people from his constituency when other Members of Parliament from that area do not have even one single nominee, </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: Tell him again. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MICHOMA: He has heard. The other point is on the question ofallocation of plots. For example, in Kisii Town, there was one Asian known asGudka who acquired many plots. The councillors and the chairman of plots allocation committee I do not know who he isdenied wananchi that facility. has come for things to be straightened; Kenya is Independent. I know that the District Commissioner is the Chairman of the Plots Allocation Committee, but this is excessive power, Sir.I beg to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BOY: Absante sana Bw.

Spika, V/ilaya ya Kwale inakua hasa lava sababu yaMpango v/a kuzifanya Wilaya Chanz cha Maendeleo, lakini ukosefu wa nyumba katika mji v/a ICvvale umezidi.

Konseli ya Kwale ingefaa ikubaliane ipewe mkopo wa kujenga hoteli moja ya v/ale watu tunaowaita makabwela kama vile madereva v/a Mawaziri, h na hapo pesa zingekuwa zikipatikana.

JALDESA: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, for giving me thisopportunity to contribute on the Vote of the ministry of Local Government. This isa very important Ministry in the sense that it takes care of the elected leadersin the local authorities. The local authorities themselves, that is, the countycouncils, the urban councils and the municipalities are all very important. Mr.Speaker, Sir, are thing which surprises me is that the senior officers in thelocal authorities, particularly in the Northern part of Kenya, are so powerful thattheir power even exceeds that of the Minister for local Government. If you take for example, an area like Isiolo, you will find that we have been complaining to the Minister about theClerk to the Council for the last four years. All the previous Members of Parliamentfrom this area, the chairmen of county councils, all the Kanu officials and everybodyelse including senior Government officers from this district, have been complainingabout this particular officer. Despite the fact that the Minister has promised totake action against this officer, nothing has been done. He are aware of factthat this calibre of officers are now transferable to other local authorities but, because of the corrupt system in the local authorities, 90 per cent of the revenue collectedin that District goes to the pocket of the Clerk to the Council who uses it for his personal defence. All his evil activities are covered up by the money that he gets illegally.Mr. Speaker, Sir, time and again we have complained this to the Ministerand to some senior officers in the Ministry, but this man seems to have laid such astrong base for himself in the Ministry that he cannot be transferred from where heis. Some time back, some senior officers in the Ministry defied the Minister'sorder when, he ordered inspectors to go to Isiolo to investigate the activities ofthis officer. So, with all due respect to the Minister, for whom I have a very highregard, he should try and make sure that the local authorities are run effectively ina manner that can serve the people they are intended to serve.Mr. Speaker, Sir, hon. Members have talked about plot allocation. InIsiolo, the same officer has discovered a very complicated method, in which hegoes to all the influencial personalities and tells them, “Come to Isiolo and Iwill give you plots", and in fact, he has done so. He has been doing that and hewill continue to do so because there are people who arc proecting him indirectly.The other thing which I would like to talk about is with regard to electoral areas in the local authorities. Recently, there was a Commission established to review electoral boundaries in constituencies and wards. However, Sir, I am surprised that this Commission has not reviewed electoral boundaries in my constituency. I am saying this because although my constituency is thinly populated, it is very vast. We have only five elected councillors, although this areas has been recommended for an additional ward. SHE However, to my surprise, this ward has beentaken to another constituency although, according to the recommendation by the district development committee, ray constituency was the one supposed to be given priority, because it is very large. I appeal to the Minister to do something about this before the nest elections to review electoral boundaries in this area.Mr. Speaker. Sir, councillors' allowances have been the subject ofdebate in this House. It is my opinion that councillors, being elected leaders, earnvery little allowances. Isiolo County Council would be one of the richest country councils in the Republic had it not been for corruption. I think the Minister should devise a method of giving more allowances to councillors in an area which is capable of paying the councillors instead of, for example, equatiing councillors in Isiolo, with those in Marsabit. I know that Marsabit county council cannot afford to pay its councillors, but Isiolo county council can do so, if only the Ministercan remove that bad man from there. If this man could be removed from Isiolo, then Isiolo country council would be the riches and I do not see any reason why councillors there could not be given more allowances.Mr. Speaker, Sir, worse of all problems in Isiolo District, is the problem of banditry activities. It is not surprising to find that the whole cause of tribal, conflict between the neighbouring districts and Isiolo District, comes from the county council offices. Recently, leaders from Garissa and Isiolo met and pledged to unit and pie ache peace, but this Clerk to the Council organized a dele-gation of five councillors to the Provincial Commissioner to say that they refuse to accept what we, as leaders, had declared to do. So, unless the Minister take action against this officer, the only thing left for us now is to demostrate.exhausted all the other machinery. The Minister should expect this very soon from Isiolo. I AM saying this because this man is becoming a security RISK.The worst thing is that whenever there is any correspondence from the districtto the Headquarters here, there is a junior officer who takes all the letters fromthis officer's file, and this is very dangerous. Eighty per cent of the revenuecollected in Isiolo County Council is being used by this man to cover his evilactivities, and we do not foresee any improvement.Therefore, I would like to make a very humble request to the Ministerto take the necessary action. I know the Minister personally and, maybe, he isbeing given a very different picture from what is happening out there in Isiolo.I have no doubt that the Minister is very sincere but he must check to find outwhat is happening. We cannot all be complaining about one man for many years.All the Members of Parliament from Isiolo District have been complaining aboutthis man in writing. Even the former town clerk, the District Kanu Chairman,and his predecessor, have been complaining about this man, We cannot all be complaining about one man without a reason. We know that this man cannot face the public and so, the best thing that the Minister can do if he cannot discipline the officer since he is powerful after accumulating a lot of money from illegal collections is to transfer him to another place. </Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: We do not want him! </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.JALDESA: Perhaps he cannot work anywhere else, but if he cannot bedisciplined, the only thing that the Minister can do is to transfer him elsewhere. With those few remarks, I beg to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TOURISM AND WILDLIFE (Mr. Njuno): Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, for giving me this opportunity to support this very important Vote of the Ministry of Local Government. The Minister concerned is a good friend of mine, and he is a man I respect highly. However, what I am going to say is for his own benefit and, I know, he will be grateful in future when he comes back hereand I only give him six months to do so and tell us that he has placed, Kirinyaga County Council under a commission, because it is collapsing.Mr. Speaker, Sir, it has been very strong financially for all those years since it was incepted. Everything has been going on very well. I know at one time we had problems with the late Minister for Local Government. But this time, I do not blame the Minister for the problems we have. The problems are there because of "godfathers" in the Ministry. They are the ones who condone mistakes done by some individuals.Mr. Speaker, Sir, our laws here say that the Local Governmentis for the people and not for individuals. We want to encourage theLocal Government to continue. But you will find that things go wrongfrom day to day, month to month and so on because there are some"godfathers" in the Ministry who want to support some individualsrather than the community.Mr. Speaker, Sir, Kirinyaga County Council which is collapsing today cannot give school grants to those children whose parents are unable to pay school fees simply because they do not have the money. This money has been squandered within a period of six months. What is happening today in the council is buying of vehicles, one after the other, reno¬vation of offices, buying furniture and so on, while the public is waiting for all their amenities for the taxes they pay. To make it worse, those taxpayers go to the county council offices as if it was a police station. You would have expected a mwananchi to go to the offices of his county council with confidence since he had paid his taxes. That is why he would expect to be served. However, today, they are kept outside the offices. For instance, when they go to payrevenue, they cannot go into the hall. They have to line up or queue outsidelip/waiting for long hours because they are not allowed to go in.Mr. Speaker, Sir, you will be surprised to find that there are armed guards at the entrance of the county council offices. What are they for? They are there to protect the clerk to the council.Sir, I do not hate anybody, but I am only telling the Minister that in six months time, if no action is taken, he will have to put Kirinyaga County Council under a commission because it is run bureau cratically today. Councillors cannot meet unless they are requested to come and discuss one agenda which will be chosen by senior officers. Mr. Speaker left the ChairThe Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Karauri) topic the ChairSir, it is a good for the Minister tonote this very seriously that there are several officers of thecounty council who are on compulsory leave and they are gettingtheir money. Some have stayed away for more than one year and theircases have never been resolved because nobody is interested.	"ilCouncillors cannot say anything because bureaucratically, people there havetheir "godfathers" in the Ministry. Why should we pay somebody forone year doing nothing? If he did a mistake, why was he not sacked?He could not be sacked because he had a "godfather" in the Ministry. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MBORI: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker.I am not sure whether I heard my good colleague mention that thesepeople in the council have their "godfathers" in the Ministry? Canhe tell us who are these "godfathers" in the Ministry? </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TOURISM AND WILDLIFE (Mr. Njuno):Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, if that is what the hon. Memberheard, then I will repeat it for him to hear properly. I would like ifto say that if there are "godfathers" who protect those officers, they should stop it because the council is going to collapse.Sir, ray aim in supporting this Motion is sincerely to ask the Minister to appoint a select committee or a probe committee to look into affairs of the council. Even if it is composed of two independent people they should come and save the council from collapsing, it is most welcome.Sir, today, you will find that people who were given plots legally and with all the procedures followed, and they have even the allotment letter from the Commissioner of Lands, they are not allowedto develop them because somebody feels that they were given then when he was not the clerk to the council. Now, he wants to revise all that.Now, Sir, there are so many plots which had gone halfway in development, but the work has been stopped. This is all over the district. This is done because the plots were given in his absence. I would ask the Minister to appoint a probe committee to look into this matter because it is very important. When development on these plots is being stopped, the same plots are being given to members of staff of the council and to civil servants. Councillors have no say at all in that council. I am only requesting the Minister to look into this problem. Job opportunities have always to be announced so that, allthe candidates can go for interviews. But today, people are employedby one person, and he chooses whom to employ. As a result of this,you will then find that most of the employees come from one particularplace because the councillors have no say. The council is run </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MICHOMA: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker.While I do not want to waste the time of my good friend., but the hon. Assistant Minister has alleged that Kirinyaga County Council cannot be able to meet. Is there no chairman? According to Local Government Regulations, it is the chairman who is supposed to convene meetings and not the clerk. Is there no chairman to that county council? </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TOURISM AND WILDLIFE (Mr. Njuno): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I wonder whether that was a point of order. The so called "native land" is under the trusteeship of the council. They are supposed to give the village plots to those who never got land after the emergency. They are landless, and they are supposed to live in those village plots. However, today,when the county council gives plots to those who are landless, thebureaucracy conies and "uproots" them. The council gives them to someother people. The council goes and gives out the next village plots.to landless people but Again, somebody else comes and "uproots” them.All the matters that we take to the Ministry is turned down becausewe do not know what they know and they do not know what we know!I am now requesting the Minister to help now before the county council Collapses. He should change the system because it is very bad. We do not have a treasurer. We have only one person who signs cheques. Why? What was the mistake of the treasurer? Why was he sent home for all those months, and getting his full salary?Sir, we were told that there would be a commission that would be responsible for the senior officers of the councils. Why are they now left to the mercy of one individual? Thank you, Sir. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MATHENGE: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker for allowing me to contribute to this very important Vote.Sir, the Local Authorities we have today seem to be "lame" because there is No development which is going on in this country. This is because the local councils, do not know what they should do. It is high time those local authorities in the rural areas directed their development programmes through the district development committees. Today those two organisations are working along different lines, and the work done by the local authorities is not seen. Wananchi have been paying rates, cess and rents but no services are being rendered to them. I wonder where all this money goes. Whenever local authorities design new projects, they go looking for loans. This happens particularly when local authorities want to construct new sewerage systems; they always go for grants from the Ministry of Local Government. When you hear that, you are bound to ask yourself whether it is actually true because, since the time of Independence, no local authority has ever completed even one project by itself.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Local Government is very important to our people. It is true that previously the local authorities were doing the maintenance of roads. In fact, up to now, they have machinery which is lying idle. Some of the machinery is broken down and it is not being used. You find that instead of working for the people and bringing development to the people, the elected councillors' main duty is to grab plots to enrich themselves. Do we really elect councillors to enrich themselves or to initiate development projects in their areas? The Minister for Local Government should select a commission to go round the country and assess what individual local authorities are doing. I do not agree with that hon. Member fjo^ Isiolo who said that county council clerks should be transferred £H from one place to another when they do something wrong. My opinion is that if a clerk to a given local authority does a wrong, thing, he should not just be transferred; he should be sacked. If you transfer that officer, he will carry over the sane misdeeds to another local authority. If county council clerks are causing chaos, then the Ministry of Local Government should come out with actions to rectify the situation. Everywhere inthis country everyone is crying about local authorities.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I want to urge the local authorities in my area to avail culverts to our roads because, during rainy seasons, we cannot cross some roads even to go to schools. The relevant councils should look into the matter seriously and supply us with culverts in order to make our roads passable even during rainy seasons. Although they have money, whenever you go to them they tell you that there is no money at all or that they do not tag have an allocation for what you are telling them to do. What then is the use of having the local authorities? It is fee high time the Minister reformed his councils with a view to making them render services to wananchi. All councillors should be stopped from snatching plots and be told that they should work for this country. This country is on the run and it should be developed. In fact, corruption starts right from the local authorities before spreading to other places. Councillors are using a lot of Government money to buy many vehicles for transporting them but not for doing work for wananchi. So, I kindly urge the Ministry Local Government to reorganise his local authorities.Sir, due to the increased number of locations in my area, we now have four more electoral wards for councillors. We want to see those elected councillors working and bringing development to the people. If they cannot work, then the Minister for Local Government should devise another way of bringing development to the people. That is why I said that any development project in a district, no matter how small and no matter who is doing it, should be done through the district development committee. You find that when you go to ask about any development project from the councils, somebody refers you to the district development committees. What are the councils themselves doing?Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have settled quite a number of landless people. Despite this settlement plan, we have left some areas for public utility. However, the local authorities are now using the areas we have left for public utility to allocate people plots. In fact, the councillors areallocating plots to only those who vote for them. Those people who are allocated plots ore paying a sum of Kshs 1.000/ per plot, which money is not brought to theaccount books of the Local authorities. Where does this money go? There are some people who paid and have receipts dating as far back as 1976 but they have not been allocated plots. Is this the way we are going to run our local authorities? It is high time the local authorities pulled up their socks and looked for ways and means of coordinating development together with other people. I appeal to the Minister for Local Government to put an end to this allocation of plots which is being done without any plans because this is what is bringing corruption in the rural areas. In fact, in my area, there is a plot that the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources has given to the local authority for future development in the town. Even before the area has been planned, councillors have already started giving out plots to people who have paid money. The Minister should take note of this and stop all this malpractice s in our local authorities so that we can march together in development.With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the Motion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

I must thank the hon.Minister for moving his Vote very ably. Sir, it is very encouraging to note thatsince the attainment of Independence, local authorities have been playing a greatrole in the development of this country and they must be viewed as such. In a countrylike ours we have 80 per cent of our people living in the rural areas. We mustytherefore, look at the role of the local authorities, particularly the country councilsin that concept.Over a number of years, we have seen what Government has been trying to do with regard to the upcoming urban centres. I would like to thank the Minister who has been constantly been reviewing the position of upcoming urban centres and providing for them, a local authority: a nucleus of local Government in those particular areas. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would particularly like to thank the Minister for what he has done in my own district which Kisil and in Ogembo, Nyanira and so on. This has been done all over the place showing that the distribution of urban councils and town councils has an approach of a balanced growth.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, another important point which I would like to make is that from the point of view of development, local authorities must be viewed, not as structures for their own sake, but as instruments of developmentfor our own people in the rural areas. We now have a situation where we must maintain an urban rural balance and if we do not maintain this balance, everybody rail tend to come to Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu and so on, and the provision of services in the rural areas will be affected. The point I would like to make to the Minister is that the upcoming towns should be given funds, in fact, that is what this House should be talking about. The Question of a councillor who says this or that or does this or that, is a matter which can be followed up so that he can bedisciplined. The question which this House should be very much concerned about iswhether we are providing the local authorities with enough funds to develop the infrastructure which is important. The infrastructure is important and it touches on the question of provision of water, houses and so on, because we want the upcoming towns or urban councils to be assisted, so that our people do not continue migrating to Nairobi, and into other large towns, just because they feel that everything good comes out of Nairobi. As we go ahead, Nairobi will not be in a position to provide for everybody who comes here and, therefore, we must hold back our people in the small upcoming towns. I think this House should give the Minister all the support that he requires.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Local Government Loans Authority should be strengthened so that it is able to attract funds for itself, as a revolving fund, just like other organisations do. This will mean that the Minister should be able to shop around for donor countries which can help us, and a number of countries have helped us, particularly the Nordic countries, West Germany and so on, so that we can provide for this kind of services.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the question of land is a very important one. Land in this country is very limited and every day that our population goes up it means that we have less and less land available in Kenya. It is important, therefore, that those who are the custodians of land allocation do allocate land as carefully as they can. Local authorities must make sure that there' is s enough land left for development and for common services. They must make sure that there is enough land left for schools, hospitals, playgrounds for school children who are coming up and so on. If land allocation is not properly checked, it will bring us to danger. There have been cases of county councils acting irresponsibly in plot allocation, a question which quite a number of hon. Members have raised hue and cry about. However, councillors are not elected to go and allocate land to people, but some councillors make sure that before their tunure of service expires, they have done their best to allocate land to themselves, or to their friends and so on. This must be stopped! We may not like the role of the Administration. </Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: Forget the Administration for a while. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR PLANNING AND NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Omanga):I can hear the hon. Member for Butere making a comment about this, but as far asthis House knows the district commissioners are the chairmen of the district allocationcommittees. Sir, I do not want to mention places here, hut I have a strong fear thatas general elections approach, the allocation of land can be so irrational that acouncillor may be able to say, "Oh, I was able to do this for you, therefore, be mygodfather, as far as this or that is concerned". I some cases, I think we could goas far as suggesting that, the Minister should stop this exercise of a land allocationunless it is strictlu necessary. I am saying this because we are likely to get into asituation where by the time we find out what has happened, we aretold that the land has gone. There is a case where land which is normally usedas a burial ground for the Muslim community in a town which is very close to myhome, was also allocated to another community for church building. There is no easier way of bringing about interreligious conflict than to invite a Christian denomination to build a church next to a Mislim cemetery. This is very wrong. So,this kind of practice needs to be completely stopped. Finally, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, district development committees play a great role in terms of our development process, but local authorities are also encompassed in the district development committees, but they do not need parallel planning in those particular areas. However, they are fully represented in the district development committees so that they can be able to discuss things there and not to appear to run. There is only one National Assembly. The local authorities are subordinate to the National Assembly and they should not try to become the National Assembly within their set up and, I am sure, this has never been envisaged to be the case. I am sure the hon. Minister, who is the supervisor and the watchdog on behalf of the people, will bear this in mind so that local autho¬rities are brought into line with the general policies which are going on.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, when I said that the local authorities should not appear to run like this National Assembly, I meant to say that everybody has his role to playSir, the local councillor has his role. He can never be a substitute for a Member of Parliament. He cannot! Nor can he try to grow horns bigger than those worn by a Member of Parliament in his place. I think it is important that this is understood. In some places, some counciIlors have even gone beyond their areas of juris¬diction. They do not realise that they are councillors within a wardand, therefore, their effectiveness is judged by that ward. They have even gone beyond that situation.Again, here, Sir, I hope the Minister will do what he can to cautiously to draw the attention to the Administration to do what they can.With those few words, I beg to support. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUNYAO: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me time also to join my friends in congratulating the Minister for Local Government. I would like to congratulate him for ably handling the affairs of the councils in this country.Sir, councils are one of the most difficult institutions in this country. I remember one time we had a Motion here to do with the welfare of councillors, but somehow, we decided to do otherwise. I do not intend to bring it up, but councils are the most difficult institutions to run in the country.Sir, I have about five items which I would like the Minister, at the time of replying, to make a comment on, One, if the Minister takes the House seriously, and if the respects the House, about three or four times last time was in April this year the Minister for Local Government, hon. Mudavadi, stood here and directed the County Council of Machakos to employ Joyce Mbura since December, 1986, and that has never been done. Who is bigger than the other, the council or the Minister? The Minister should direct the council in what to do. That has never been done. It would be a very big shame if thatshould happen. It is all here in the HANSARD. The Minister directed here about three or four times that this lady ought to be employed. This is since December, 1986. I have written to the Minister, and I have all the respect for the Minister. But I am surprised to what has been happening to his own local officials.Sir, the other point I would like the Minister to tell me and also the people of Mbooni, is why Ave have two locations in Mbooni which, since time immemorial, have never been declared electoral areas. This is Tulimani Location which is part of Mbooni since 1963, and Kalawa Location. They have never had a councillor.  All the time they have been taken care of by the councillors from the old locations that is the councillor from Mbooni and the councillor from Kimauni. I would like to support the Minister to get even double the money he is asking today, but let that money be used to provide services to wananchi.Sir, I would like to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that since some of the roads were constructed in several towns, it is a long time and population has increased tremendously. For example, all roads leading into Nairobi need to be rewidened up. For instance, Kiambu Road, Langata Road and so on. It is impossible to move along those roads in the morning. There is congestion of traffic. People take about three or four hours to get to town. I live in Langata. Every morning, if you leave after 6.30 a.m., you will not get to town on time. You will get to town after 9.00 o'clock. This is due to congestion of traffic. Estates are also mushrooming up everywhere. For instance, the Langata Dam Site and several others. As these estates are mushrooming up, the Minister should be planning well in advance where to provide some dual carriage ways in those area At times, we have also to provide overhead bridges or whatever so that it might be easier for people to get to work on time. If is impossiblenow for people to get to work on time in this City. I am wonderingwhat the Minister is planning to do in future. We are hardly onemillion people in this City. What are we going to do when we aremore than five million people? We have some world cities where theMinister and his senior officers have been. For instance, Hong Kongwhich is a new town. This city alone has more than six millionpeople, but the traffic is very well controlled. It is high time theMinister for Local Government worked in close liaison with theMinister for Transport and Communications and any other Minister, andparticularly he should work in close liaison also with the Ministerfor Environment and Natural Resources. I can see them sitting closetogether. They should also be closer in offices so that they canshare ideas so that this town is not as stinking as it is at the moment,Sir, our town has also to be planned properly to provide amenities in all asthe areas necessary. For instance, look at the areas of buses, matatusand so on? There is congestion all over the place. It is high timethe Minister for Local Government, the Administration, the police,and everybody gave ideas as to how these things should be planned.I am sure that in about four or five years in. this City, one will notbe able to walk leave alone cycling.	Sir, I would like to congratulate Brig. Shigoli and his team, but they need some assistance. As hon. Shikuku said earlier, the city is stinking very badly. I support the Minister when he appeals forfunds to buy some fire extinguishers and so on. I am sure he needsthem because every home in Nairobi has a pit where to dump thegarbage., Look at all areas, everywhere! Every home has dug up a pit because the people in the City Commission are not collecting the garbage anymore. What do we do?Sir, I am happy that the Minister talked about fire because it has become a threat in the City. I would like to appeal to him todo something about it. For instance, on 8th May, this year I readfrom the local dailies the Minister for Works, Housing and PhysicalPlanning then, hon. Matiba, at the Railway Club, inaugurated achemical known as "PTE 111". This chemical is inflammable. It can be used in oil paints and so on. So, if it is used in oil paints it means it will prevent fire, and there will be no fire in this town. Therefore, since the chemical has been approved and recommended by the Ministry of Works, Housing and Physical Planning, why do we not use it and make it mandatory that it should used in every building, kiosk, jiko and all places? It has been analysed and the Minister was talking about it. It is totally inflammable. So, let it be taken seriously,and be used in a lot of areas. For instance, offices and so on. Then we will prevent fire.Sir, fire is dangerous. Now, having said that, I will address the Minister about the money he is demanding now. It is a shock to tell the Minister that at the moment, as we are talking now, most of the senior officers in Machakos County Council are not there. What is he going to do with the money we are going to give to him? This is a council with no deputy clerk, committee clerk, treasurer, deputy treasurer, payment cashier, building superintendent, divisional community development assistant, market superintendent, surveyors, and all the rest of them. About ten posts are all handled by one man. Why should we do that?Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, if the Minister getsthis money today can he promise this Housethat he is going to make sure that the County Council of Masakuis going to "be assisted? I congratulate the new Town Clerk forMachakos. He has put that office in a good operating position. Previous Town Clerk and his people have been, doing nothing other than selling sand. That is a Miserable situation. Sand collection in Machakos District has become chaotic. This is because the issue has been left in the hands of the County Council. So, you will find that there are problems every day.The other day, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, you read in the newspapers that over 200 people in Liwala area had declared war on sand harvesters., Last Saturday over 10 people in Tawa declared war on sand collectors. what has been happening is that a few county council officials and their godfathers have been giving permission to some people to collect sand from Machakos without any revenue going to the county council. The revenue accruing from sand collection has been going into the pockets of a few individuals.I have a lot of respect for the ordinary councillors of Machakos Municipality and the new Town Clerk. But the previous Town Clerk and a few other people left a lot to be desired I will take time to prove this point because I have got a Motion which I am going to Table in this House on sand harvesting in Machakos. This is looting being done in Machakos District. I hope the Minister will be able to do something when I move that Motion. This question, of sand harvesting or looting in Machakos District is a sad affair.with those remarks, I beg to support the Motion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ANGATIA: I thank, you. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker. Sir for the opportunity so that I nay also contribute to this Motion. First of all I would like to appeal to the Minister to make the newly created locations into electoral wards. The more wards we have the more councillors we have and the closer the electoral system comes to the people and I think the closer the administrative system comes to wananchi. When we have this kind of arrangement it means that the people are in touch with the authorities and elected leaders who can speak for them. This ensures that people do not suffer quietly without anyone speaking on their behalf. Therefore I am sure that the Minister wallappreciate that all the newly created locations administrative locations deserve to have elected representatives. They should be made wards immediately and have councillors before the next general elections.The second point I would like to bring to the attention of the Minister concerns the councillors salaries. I know many think that councillors do very little andtherefore they do not deserve to be given more allowances. But you will find that KShs.l,200/ per month for a councillor in a situation where he must always appear in. Harambee meetings and travel on behalf of wananchi to go and plead for various issues and meet visitors and appear presentable in frontof the electors and visitors You will agree with me thatShs.l,200/ as allowance per month is too little. The councillorsdeserve to be given something reasonable. No amount of money can be enough but I think the Minister will agree with me that this is too little.MR. Temporary Deputy Speaker. Sir, either we havecouncillors and give them proper allowances, and they do the jobwe want them for or we do not have councillors and therefore wedo not have the allowances and therefore the work is done bysomebody else. As the situation is, we have agreed that we willhave councillors. If we have councillors let us give them reasonable allowancesMy third point, MR. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, is about cleanliness in the City of Nairobi. It is not possible for the City Commission workers in Nairobi to keep this City clean. It does not matter how many people you employ. It is not possible to keep this City clean. Unless we agree that for every resident in Nairobi City we shall have a cleaner, it is not easy to keep the City clean. This is because he every resident is dropping some paper: every resident is clearless and he is dropping rubbish around. Every resident is doing some tiling that make s the City dirty. So, to ask cleaners to be following everybody, whether they have a bus ticket which they are dropping on the road ora	letter which they have read and they are droppinga piece of paper on the road or they have cleaned their housesand they are throwing rubbish out of their houses It is notpossible for City Commission workers alone to keep this City as clean as we would like it to be.We want to appeal to the wananchi of this country particularly the residents of Nairobi, since they are the leaders in development being modern and in civilization, to make sure that they help;	to make the city clean.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we can even flog workers"	create ii the office of the commissionerthe office of a governor and even another office for cleaners. You cannot keep the city clean unless the residents themselves decide they want a clean city. Cleanliness is a state of development; it is a state of awareness for somebody who wants a decent life. You cannot lead a decent life if you have rubbish all around you at your backyard, in front, around your house, on your clothes, on the road and even in the shops. People are dropping litter everywhere and dropping, the rubbish they have swept into the road. A system of educating our people should be found. And I am appealing to the hon. Members of this House, and I know the Minister can join me through his councillors and the local authorities and also all other Kenyans, to make sure that we keep our city clean for our own good life. If we appreciate cleanliness, then it means we appreciate decent life and a clean environment in which we can enjoy our good e weather our good country, our good facilities and all the other good things we enjoy.We can have the Government spend money on tarmacking roads building beautiful houses, parks, and everything, but if the residents do not want that kind of standard of living, clean areas they will make it dirty, making tarmacking roads will come to nothing, building good houses will come to nothing, creating beautiful parks and planting flowers will come to nothing if the residentsdo not want a clean city.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am spending timeon this one because I would like to appeal to all, particularly	on this occasion when were debating this Vote, and to the Minister,also, to set up a some committees as thinktanks to work out what we can do to educate our wananchi so that they can appreciate cleanliness, not only in Nairobi, but also in all our towns. It is possible to reduce the number of cleaners we have in Nairobi, Kisumu, Mombasa, and all the other towns, and still keep the towns cleaner than they are provided the residents are mindful of clean-liness.I would like to thank the Minister for the efforts that have been made in small municipalities like Kakamega. We now have a reasonable bus park there; there is some fresh air in the town and also, we now have some vehicles and equipment for fire fighting. But ocassionally, we see these vehicles being used as if they were passenger vehicles. If, for example a fire broke out when the vehicle was far away at Mukumu or at the hospital dropping people there, people would not get it when they need it because it has gone passengering carrying people and dropping them around. I hope the Minister will look into this to make sure that those vehicles are used for fire fighting and that they are increased and looked after properly because fires do not tell you when they are going to come. They do not wait until you have dropped your friend in an estate in order that it may break out. They break out at any time.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to support one hon. Member who talked about the local Government loans Authority. I would like to appeal to the Minister to give some power to this Authority and make it a fully fledged bank at the disposal of the local authorities. It is possible to makethis Authority a proper bank. In this way, it will carry out its duties responsibly such as paying out money, and it will also make sure that it pays its debts responsibly. This is better instead of having a loose arrangement whereby local authorities can borrow money from the Authority without taking it too seriously. They think that since the money came from the Government they can take it easily since the Authority is part of the same Government.Therefore, they do not make any effort to make sure that this money is paid. We would like the Minister to look seriously into the possibility of making this Authority a fullyfleged bank to serve the local authorities.The next point that have is on the Commissioner of	and the land local authorities. People want to put up industries, houses,and various institutions in towns, market places and small urbanareas, but the land still belongs to individuals.This is becoming a big problem If you take local authorities that were madeurban councils recently, such as Mumias, Luanda, and others, you will find that their land still belongs to individuals who are putting up permanent a true vices However, the Commissioner of Land has not taken over this land in order to make sure that planning is properly done in such a manner that if there is going to be a police station, a school or a factory that emits a lot of smoke in certain areas, these facilities are where they are required., Nobody has thought of this. When you make a place like Luanda or Mumias an urban council, somebody should now in quickly to plant and instill restriction so that nobody does a certain thing in this or that area, we cannot wait until it is too late or until the situation is smoldering and suffocating us before we realise that we should plan and allocate land to various sectors of a town0 The moment any area is declared an urban, market or trading area, a system should be evolved where land is acquired immediately and planning starts at once. We have very good planners in this country, as we have the necessary facilities, people and foresight. We know what we want and yet we sit back and see structures go up0 We know that these are the wrong structures, but they are growing up because we are too late in planning these are as o So, a combination of the Ministry of Local Government and the Commissioner of Lands ought to move in quickly and make sure that these axe as are properly planned so that they do not grow up as they wish and that everything is not left to chance. This will also minimise the exploitation of wananchi by a few people who happen to accidentally have land close to these councils whereby they keep selling land to one person today and reselling it to other people the following day In this process, these landlords exploit people besides creating congestion and bad town development.With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker Sir, I beg tosupport </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES (prof. Sumbi): Thank you very much, MR. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for this opportunity to contribute to this Votion. The Ministry of Local Government is very important  as it one emphasise both rural and urban areas.My first point is on physical planning The previous speaker mentioned something about this, and I would like to emphasise that the Ministries of Local Government and Works, Housing and Physical Planning, whenever they see 'a shopping centred where people have started constructing the first permanent buildings, should move in and carry out physical planning there Most of you here have been to Mombasa, I am sure Along the Nairobi Mombasa Road, you Trill see that towns and shopping centres have sprung up, but whenever you approach them you are, first of all, faced by either dirty kiosks or shallow pit latrines, and you find that you even do not want to get in there because of the smell coming from the toilets. If the physical planner had initially gone there you would be faced by beautiful buildings beside which one would want to stop and have a soda. So, I request the Ministries of local Government and Works, Housing and Physical 33 Planning to come together and make sure that they carry out physical planning before a lot of buildings are constructed in a place.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, dirt seems to be our lover. I am saying this because cur main towns and even our smaller ones are today very filthy. The previous speaker said that every wananchi should be made aware of the import¬ance of cleanness. The Ministry of Local Government should provide equipment for garbage collection and workers who can work. If that is not possible, just like we have seen in Nairobi where a lot has been done to remove garbage, then we do not know what to do. We are aware that Nairobi estates that are occupied by the middle and upper income groups are very dirty. The residents just throw the garbage outside their houses and no vehicles come to collect the garbage for months, although we continue to pay for garbage collection. For example, I have talked to the town clerk and to the deputy town clerk to come and see for themselves the garbage in Gurnmo Estate but nothing has happened. I have even mobilised the residents and told them not to throw papers all over the place, but they asked me, "If our dust bins are full, then where do we take the garbage?" There are so many flies around that area that I am even scared that my children may get sick. Why can we not get sufficient vehicles to collect all that garbage. Why can we even not start a fund on Earambee basis to keep our city and our towns clean Why can we not do something like that to buy the necessary equipment if the City Commission cannot afford?Sir, there is another alternative that I would like to suggest to the Minister for Local Government. In most towns and cities around the world, it is not the local authorities that provide garbage "collection services. Why can we not get contractors to do that job." That way, we would be able to tell the contractors, "If this garbage is not collected, we are not going to pay you for this month". Why can we not have something like that because the employees we have, especially the City Commission workers, are not able to do the job? For example; there is one street where my house is located in Gurnmo Estate that can be kept clean by one person if he works at least five hours a day. But when you go there you find a group of about 20 men and women sweeping the same street butthey never keep it clean. They draw the garbage from the road and put it on the pavement, and when I asked them why they do that, they said, "That, is someone else's department; soma other people will collect the garbage and take it away". But before those other people come, the filth is blown by the wind to the doors and to the road again.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am saying that His Excellency the President zfcs has assisted to keep Nairobi clean, but we are not keeping the city clean ourselves. If the workers continue to be the way they are, we should give this job to private firms who will be able to keep the city clean. </Newspeech><Header>  ADJOURNMENT </Header><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (hon.
