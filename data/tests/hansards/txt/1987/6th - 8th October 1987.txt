(Prof. Saitoti)ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS 	Question No.538<Newspeech>MR. MBORI asked the Minister for Environment and Natural Resources(a) whether he is aware that there has been serious deforestation of Kodera Forest of South Nyanza County Council by timber businessmen or from neighbouring districts; and(b) whether he could order immediate termination of this wanton damage of forest and ensure that in future this forest is properly conserved.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES(Mr. Korellach): Mr. Speaker Sir, I beg to reply.(a) Yes, the Minister is aware that this South Nyanza ownedand managed forest is very badly managed and exploited. The Ministryof Environment and Natural Resources has however, drawn theattention of the county council to this and given proper adviceon how to manage and conserve the forest. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES. (Mr. Korellach (Ctd.):(b) Following the above answer to the hon. Member's Question, the District Forest Officer has given advice to theCounty Council and the Chief Conservator of Forests has also written to the Clerk of the County Council on the same subject, giving a copy to the District Commissioner. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MBORI: Arising from that reply, Mr. Speaker, Sir,	that the County Council or Kodera Forest a in Kaspul/Kabondo isvery badly managed, and realising that so much timber hasbeen damaged up to now, what steps are being taken to replace thedeforested forests so that the area conserves nature as well asserve the county council and the ordinary people the way theywere originally meant to be served? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KORELLACH: Mr. Speaker Sir, I would first like tothank the hon. Member for showing such keen interest in the preservation of this forest. In 1986, this county council was asked by the Forest Department to stop further felling of trees until proper management place in planning programmes have been drawn for them. The advice has been given to the county council by the Chief Conservator of Forest and his advice is as follows"The trees, most of which are 30 years old and above, which are normally ready for havest, once cut, they  have to be replaced."Following this advice, an area of about 15 hectares has now been replanted by the county council. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MBORI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just left the forestarea just yesterday and I still observed the trees? carelessly .	felled without replacement? what is the Assistant Minister, during?Is he trying to make, this place a desert or what is he thinking? aboutThe advice of the forester has been ignored by the staff of the county council</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KORELLACH: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we would have expected that by now, this advice should have been taken seriously. If this destruction of trees continues, the Forest Department might be forced to ask the county council to hand over the management of this forest to the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources which is charged with the responsibility of conserving natural resources in this Republic. </Newspeech>(Mr. Omsmo was applauded as be entered the Chamber) Question No. 523MR. GACHANJA asked the Minister forLocal Government:(a)	whether he is aware that Salim Road which passes through Muslim Villageto Gatiria in Dagorettin is impassable; and(b)	when the, road is going to be tarmacked.THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. Ogle): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was not able to listen properly because the hon. Shikuku was shouting.I now beg to reply.(a)	 I am aware that Salim Road is currently in poor state of repair.(b)	There are no funds to construct the road to bitumen standards at the moment. However, it is the intention of the City Commission to grade the road immediately after the current grading end murraming of roads at Korogocho Settlement are complete. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. GACHANJA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is very surprising to hear the lion. Assistant Minister saying that there are no funds to repair the roads while the City Commission has funds to fuel vehicles to chase women hawkers here selling</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. GACHANJA ( Ctd ):fruits and vegetables, and stealing them; yet they say they have no money to repair the only two graders they have in the City? Can he comment on that, Six? </Newspeech>			<Newspeech>MR. OGLE: That is an entirely different question, Mr. Speaker, Sir. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. GACHANJA: This is not a different question, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I said that the Nairobi City has two graders which are now grounded. I have also said that the City Commission has money and that it has bought vehicles which its askaris use to chase women hawkers who sell fruits and vegetables in the City. I would like the Assistant Minister to comment on that. </Newspeech><Newspeech> MS. OGLE: Mr. Speaker, Sir," I still maintain that that is an entirely different question. But with regard to grading or tamarcking this road, I would like to say that we are looking for finances. I would also like to draw the attention of the hon. Member to the fact that His Excellency the President has directed that this road? be tarmacked and it, therefore takes priority overall other projects We are intending to start the work fairlysoon. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. GACHANJA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Korogocho SettlementScheme was started early this year. had never been graded or murramed before. that was preventing the City Commission from grading or murraming. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OGLE: Honestly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not know what the hon. Member is trying to say. There are very many projects in the City which have not been undertaken by the Ministry for various reasons, the main one being lack of finances. But since we have got to deal specifically with the Question as it was raised originally, we will try and do this particular road. It is going to take priority over all other projects. I think the hon. Member should say "Thank you" and just give us time to do the work. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Hon. Dr. Wameyo's Question. </Newspeech>Question No.487Dr. Wameyo not here? Mr. Munyao's Question. Question No.517<Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Mr. Munyao also not here? Mr. Omido's</Newspeech>Question.Question No.504MR. OMIDO asked the Minister for Labour:(a)	whether he is aware that all employees working in the factory of M/S Patco Industries, of Lunga Lunga Road P.O. Box 44100, Nairobi have been employedon casual basis for periods ranging between one year and 10 years;(b)	whether he is also aware that women employees are inspected sometimes half naked by a Mr. Patan:(c)	whether he is aware that the evening shift of the company starts work at 5.30 p.m. and finishes at 8.15 a.m. the following day thus having 15 hours working shift; and(d)	what steps he is taking to ensure that fair treatment of the workers and  respect for women employees of the company.<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. Okondo): Mr. Speaker, Sir before I reply to this Question I would like to ask for your pardon that as much as I tried to make the answer short, the answer is still pretty long. So, I do hope that the House will bear out with me. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (ctd);Having said that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. I am aware that M/S Patco Industries have been employing 46 employees as casuals, for period ranging between one year and 10 years. However, they have 9 permanent employees.I am also aware that women employees were sometimes inspected as a means to curb thefts of sweets being manufactured by the Company. These inspections were however done by a female employees but we have no evidence and at present and we have not been able to establish concretely that Mr. Patan present during such inspections.I am aware that the evening shift starts at 6.00 p.m. and finishes at 80OO a.m. next morning, with one hour break between 1.00 a.m. and 2.00 a.m., thus having a 13 hoursworking shift, and not 15 hours shift.One receipt of this Parliamentary Question, Mr. Speaker, Sir, investigations were conducted and although the employer claimed that the 46 employees were casuals, leave pay for them has been demanded by my Labour Officer based on an average of 10 months worked per year for the last three years. The employer has now accepted this demand and a sum of Shs.24,254.70 has, therefore, been deposited with the Provincial Labour Officer in Nairobi from where the affected workers can collect the money. Eleven employees who have worked with the company for the last three years continuously were offered permanent employment with effect from 1st July, 1987. The other 35 employees have been promised permanent employment with effect from 1st October, 1987.THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (ctd)Mr. Speaker, Sir, three female employees were notgranted maternity leave during their period of employment. Theirtwo months maternity leave pay has been demanded by the LabourOfficer and a sum of KShs.3,312/- has now been deposited with theProvincial Labour Officer, Nairobi. These ladies can therefore, collect their money from the Labour Office in Nairobi. Mr. Speaker, Sir, improvements in the method of inspection conducted on female workers have now been made after consultations with the labour officers concerned."Mr. Speaker, Sir, although the workers are working a shift of 13 hours a day, it was established, on investigation, that they are adequately compensated for the extra four hours that they work on top of the required 9 hours per shift. Overtime rate in respect of these 4 extra hours at the rate of 1 1/2 times entitles them to an additional payment of KShs.14.70 per shift. That, together with the actual pay of KShs.27.50 per day would make it KShs.42.40 per shift. However the employer is actually paying EShs.50/- per day per shift; that is KShs.7.60 more than the minimum rate. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KARAURI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Minister has admitted that these women employees are inspected and the Question says that the person inspecting them is Mr. Patan, Is the hon. Minister, therefore satisfied that a man should be allowed to inspect women, even if it were to curb theft of sweets? Is it really not immoral for a man to keep on inspecting women? Can they not look for a woman who can be doing this job?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKQNDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is not possible in labour. circumstances or other relationships for a man to inspect women. We do not allow it, Sir. In this particular case we looked into the matter very carefully and sent around women inspectors to ask the women whether they had been ever inspected by a man or in the presence of a man and all the women said "No" and that they have always been inspected by a woman and no man has been present when they are being inspected.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OMIBO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, a number of women employees from this firm came to my office complaining that the person who inspects them is a man. I brought this Question to the House after asking them, several times, to confirm to me that they were actually inspected by a man and not a woman. They told me that they were inspected several times by a man called Mr. Patan. Will the Minister, therefore take very severe action against this employer because what is being done to those women employees is completely against moral standards and labour conventions in this country? It is not permissible for a man to inspect women under such circumstances. This is a factory and I think the Minister knows that you are not allowed to over work employees. What action is the Minister taking to make sure that the relevant law is complied with by this employer? This is because it is contrary to factory regulations to over work workers especially women. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUIISO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.I am sure that before the Minister answers that question, the Housewould like to know who between the Minister and the Questioner ismisleading or misinforming the House. This is because the Questionermaintains that the women wore inspected by a man, but the Ministeris denying that. Is the House going to be left that confusion? Could one of them explain the truth so that we could know how to ask supplementary questions? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKONDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are three supplementary questions and at such I do not know which one to answer that is, whether to answer the two raised by the hon. Questioner or the one raised by hon. Munyao. Could I get the guidance of the Chair? AN HON. MEMBER: It is hon. Mutiso! </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OKONDOi I am sorry, Mr. Speaker, it is hon. Mutiso and not hon. munyao. The question that hon. Mutiso has raised is quite simple. We have carried out investigations and this is what we have found out. If the hon. Member has other information contrary to what was found, which violates the Law of Decency because there is a law in this country that prevents acts against indecency the culprits can be brought to court. But at present, the information we have and we can only go by this information found by the investigators who had interviewed these ladies one by one in private and come out with that. Conclusion Thus, the question that a man inspected them or that a man was present during the inspection, is not really true. So, if there is any other evidence which can be proved in court, I am quiteprepared to support these people to bring an action against the employer for indecent assault. </Newspeech><Header> Question No.115  </Header> <Newspeech>MR. SITIKUKU asked the Minister for Transport andCommunications: 	(a)	whether he is aware that konya ports Authoritypaid Messrs. Karsons Marine Supplies of Mombasa 				kshs.113s000/= in respect of Invoice No. 575 dated 4th June, 		1985; Kshs.159,000/= in respect of Invo¬ice No. 576 of 5th 		June, 1985; Kshs.164,802/= in respect of Invoice No. 577 of 		5th June, 1985 and Kshs.600,000/= in respect of Invoice No. 		593 of 2nd December, 1985; and(b)	the items that the Kenya Ports Authority purcha¬sed and   whether they were delivered and ask a acknowledged. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Magugu):           Mr. speaker, Sir. I beg to reply.	(a)I am aware.(b)	I would like to say that the items that were purchasedwere items which required by the Kenya Ports Authority such asgalvanised steel wire ropes and fasteners for the purpose of being used at the port.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUkU: Arising from that reply which is incompleteand unsatisfactory, is the Minister aware that in the audit Report made by the auditor dated 30th June, 1986 and which I laid on the Table this is k shown on Appendix A on page 18 says that for example Invoice No. 593 dated 2/12/85, is among the invoices in Appendix A covered irregular purchases? How dare the Minister stand up and with an air of being honest give such an answer when auditors stated that one of these invoices was irregular and out of order? I have just given him one example which comes from the auditor’s Report.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAGUGU: Mr. Speaker, I doujrt further that Report hasbeen discussed in this House yet, and I do remember that he raised this same subject. I think hon. Shikuku brought up this issue before we went for recess. This Auditors Report, if I remember correctly, has not been discussed in this House</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAGUGU (ctd.):but just laid on the Table. I think, hon. Shikuku will agree with me that the Auditors Report is not necessarily giving an air of confidence. I am not rejecting it but I am just stating the truth of the matter; </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SIIIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is the Minister in order to try more or less to simply down the importance of the Auditors Report? The auditors, for example, this invoice he has been referring to invoice a No. 593 of 2nd December, 1985 is listed here in Appendix A which states that these were irregular purchases. So, this company was one of the companies involved in irregular purchases which not in order. Is he in order to try and overlook this important Report which was laid down jon the Table in this House?Those purchases shown in that Report are very irregular and the Minister should be ashamed of this.</Newspeech>		<Newspeech>MR. MAGUGU: I think, Mr. Speaker, hon. Shikuku oughtto be ashamed more because all I am saying is that I do not intend to preempt the discussion of this Report before this House. It has not been discussed and I said that	before we went for Recess hon. Shilcuku raised the same similar question, and I said exactly what I am saying now. I am prepared until the AuditorsReport is discussed in the House, I would be prepared to, say whether I would address myself this question of irregular purchases as Mr. Shikuku refers to them in this Report. I am not questioning the authenticity of the Controller and Auditor General’s Report. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: On a point of order. Mr. Speaker, Sir. Does that debate disqualify the information or whether we are going to debate or net. Does this disqualify the Controller and Auditor General Report? It is true whether to do debate it or not. This is the truth. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAGUGU: Bw. Spika, nafikiri ni bora nisomo Icwa Kiswahili ili mhe. Shikuku aweze kufahamu vizuri. Hii ni lews sababu</Newspeech> (noise)<Newspeech>MR. SPEAKERS Order! </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is the Minister aware that Standing Order No. 62, which he, of course, does not know states that when you start in English you have to complete : speaking in English and you cannot true to Kiswahili, Kikuyu or any other language. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAGUGU; Mr. Speaker, I wanted to do that just for his comprehension. All I am saying is that I am not preempting the discussion of the Report as I said earlier on. The Report was prepared by the Controller and Auditor General and I happen to have read it in ray office, but it has not been discussed, although it may have been laid on the Table. So, why am I being forced to preempt the hon. Members views before they get a chance to discuss the Report?" </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OMIDO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Is the Minister in order to deny the House a satisfactory answer on a document which is official and he confirmed it to be a true document? Should he deny the House this information or is there something else that he is hiding? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAGUGU: That comment from the hen. Member is very interesting, Mr. Speaker. I thought that that Report was very obvious and thus an answer from the Minister Would not be necessary. According to hon. Shilcuku, that is what Standing Orders state. I would like to say that the Report is not being questioned by the Minister or by the Ministry. All I am saying is that any information you may wish to submit over and above this issue is already in the Report. </Newspeech><Header> Question No. 530 </Header> MR. SIFUNA asked the Minister for k Transport and Communications; (a)	whether he is aware that there are no post office services at Nzoia River Market in Bukusu Location on old Bungorra ICakamega Road; and(b)	whether he could provide postal services at this market as residents of this area have to travel over 20 kilometres to Bungoraa in order to get postal services.<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FCH TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATION (Mr. Magugu):-Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to say that I expected the Member for Bungoraa South to say whether these services have boon provided or not because, as far as I can tell, they have been provided as requested by the hon. Member. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.SIFUIIA.: Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a surprising answer from the Minister. I brought this Question to the House so that the Ministry could provide postal services to this particular centre, and the answer I have received from the Ministry is that they will provide the services before the end of this year Right now, however, the people there have to walk 20 kilometres from Nzoia to Bungoma in order to be served. The place the Minister has mentioned, Nambacha, is in Kakamega District. Could he tell us when he is going to provide postal services to Nzoia Market? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAGUGU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to plead with the hon. Member and assure him that if he has any information to the contrary of what. I have said, I will follow it up. However, the information I have is that postal services have been provided to Nzoia Market. These are the services referred to by the hon. Member9 and I can be more specific here. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SIFUNa: Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I know from the Minister</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAGUGU: I am still giving the hon. Member the relevant answer. I have information that in spite of the fact that Nzoia Market is far from Bungoma, a sub post office was opened on 9th September, 1987, at the market. I believe that the office in that area is referred to as Ndolovu Sub Post Office, which is run on an agency basis. It sells stamps, postal orders and handles registered items. I would like to know from the hon. Member if that information is correct or not. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SIFUNA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was at this particular place on Friday last week. Postal services have not been provided there0 In fact, when I got this answer from the hon. Minister's office today it said the Ministry will provide these services there this year. I wonder whether the Minister could be specific enough and tell us when he is going to provide postal services to this particular place. We know that the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SIFUNA (CTD):Corporation is(Mr. Magugu stood up and walked to the Microphone) doing a very good job, but when is it going to provide postal services to Nzoia Market?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MH. SHIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Standing Orders of this House provide that only one Member should be on his feet at any one time. When hon. Sifuna was still asking his Supplementary Question, the Minister walked away from his seat and drew close to the microphone, and there were then two Members on their feet. Would he be reminded of the relevant Standing Order?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAGUGU: Mr. Speakers Sir, hon. Shikuku will not teach me theStanding Orders of this House. He may know them by head, but I am sorry I do not fit into his "classroom".</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I still insist, as everybody here saw, that that is what the Minister did. It is really a shame for the hon. Minister to deny this. Hon. Sifuna was still oh his feet asking a Supplementary Question when the Minister stood up. Everybody here saw that. ¥hen the Minister denies this, this can show what sort of people we have running this Government.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MAGUGU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I did not, deny that; I gust said that I do not fit into this hon. Member's "classroom".I would like to state that I promise to take the necessary action. At any rate, these postal services will be provided before the end of the year. At the same time, I would like the hon. Member concerned in co-operate with us if the information I have given is not what is on the ground, in which case, I will follow up the issue with the hon. Member himself.

ID/No.0323411/63, who is a retired teacher, is receiving Shs.662.20 per month as his pension while he is expecting Shs.780/= since he left the job while already a "P3" teacher; and(d)	he can make the necessary correction and pay the complainant the right amount.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. M'Maitsi): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(a)	I am aware that Mr. Pestus Labyaka Alividza, T.S.C. No.020007 retired as a "P3" teacher with effect from 31st May, 1937, and that he is currently receiving a reduced monthly pension of Shs.662.20 because he opted for a service gratuity in one lumpsome payment which was made to him on 26th February, 1985. Furthermore, according to the Pensions Act, chapter 189 ofthe Laws of Kenya, the amount of a teacher's pension depends on the length of pensionable service and the final salary of the teacher, but it does not necessarily depend on the teacher's teaching grade.(b)	N	o, I cannot make any further adjustment on this teacher'smonthly pension payments . However, if Mr. Alividza is disputing this matter,he should refer it to the Ministry of Finance as the responsibility of my Ministryin this case ended when I supplied all the relevant information in respect ofthis teacher on from GP 178 to the Ministry of Finance. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. arap KOSKE:: Mr. Speaker, Sir. could the Assistant Ministerexplain to the House how Shs.662.20 was arrived in this particular case andwhy he believes that that amount is fair enough? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. M'MAITSI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the duty of calculatingthat particular amount lies with the Treasury and so the hon. Member could go there and find out how this happened. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. arap KOSKE: Mr. Speaker, Six, why is the Assistant Minister referring this case to the Treasury at this moment whereas this Question was presented to him several, months ago? Why could he not have done this andMR. arap KOSKE (GTD.)sbrought to the House a satisfactory answer, instead of referring us back to the Treasury? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

No.TVT.15 (204) dated 19th October, 1984.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Keriri): Mr. Speaker, Sir, on behalf of theMinister for Tourism and Wildlife, I beg to reply.Mr. Kiale Maringa (ID No. 5346255/68) who was	,killed by a buffalo, had his case passed by the Taita Taveta District Wildlife Compensation Committee sitting at Voi on 27th October, 1986 in the District Commissioner's office  A cheque No. 430069 for kshs.237,586/- dated 29th June, 1987 has already been sent to the District Commissioner Taita/Taveta with our letter Ref. MTW/5.6/3/Vol. IV/23 dated 17th July, 1987.The next of kin of Mr. Kiale Maringa will be paid the sum of.kshs.30,000/- out of the money forwarded to the District Commissioner, Taita/Taveta in respect ofthe. death of Mr. Kiale Maringa.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWACHOFI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, first of all, .1 would like to ask the Assistant Minister to correct his answer. This is because he said that the meeting was held at Voi in the District Commissioner's office and ire know that the office of the District Commissioner, Taita/T&veta, is in Wundanyi. I would like the Assistant Minister to tell the House the exact date when this letter was sent to Wundanyi. Why is it that the amount the next of kin are going to receive is less than the one he indicates in the cheque? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KERIRI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I read the date of the letter that accompanied the cheque," that is, 17th July,1987. Incidentally, I apologise far saying that the meeting was held at the District Commissioner's office, Voi, instead of Wundanyi. The other supplementary question was: Why would the next of kin be paid less money than the amount should be in the cheque?The cheque contains the total amount of money payable to several people in that district. The amount that belongs to Mr. Kiale Maringa. is only Kshs.30,000/=.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. LUKINDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while thanking the Assistant Minister for his good reply, would he tell this House what has caused all this delays since Mr. Maringa was killed by this buffalo in 1984?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KERIRI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member should be grateful that this money has, in fact, been paid. There ere many cases in this country which took place in 198l, 1982, 1983 and so on,but have not been compensated for Cases are delayed for several reasons. One of the reasons is that there may be no money in the Vote to pay the complainants and secondly, the papers may not have reached the Ministry at the right time. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

My office filed the normal documents, that is, Memorandum ofAppearance, and served the same to the plaintiff. At that time, informationwas received that the plaintiff had been injured while in police custody and the Commissioner of Police ordered an inquiry. The file was opened and the</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ATTORNEY GENERAL (Mr. Mali) Ctd:inquiry was duly registered and the results were forwarded to my office on the 12th of June, 1987 Upon reading the report, my office filed the defence to the suit and the judgment which had already entered exported, was set aside. The case is now pending for hearing(a)	The medical examination report of the Government doctor at Machaicos General Hospital, dated 26th June, 1985} shows that there is no doubt that the plaintiff had sustained some injuries. According to the policeinvestigation, the inflicting these injuries cannot be attributed to the police while Kilonzo was in police custody.(b)	Mr. Speaker, Sir, the matter is still pending in court and, perhaps, any discussion beyond what I have said might prejudice the outcome of the case.(c)	On the question of compensation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, here again,this will be determined by the outcome of the pending suit. MR. MOTISO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. MR. SPEAKER: I would like to remind the House that we have very few minutes remaining for Question Time and we still have some Questions to go. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTISO: On a point of order,. Mr. Speaker, Sir. I wonder whether what the Attorney General is referring to as sub judice concerns the original case or the case of injuries inflicted while in police custody. This is because I thought there were two cases here. Can he make that clear to us, Mr. Speaker. Sir? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. MULI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are two matters here. The first one concerns investigation as to whether the injuries were caused by police while Mr. Kilonso was a in police custody. That has been concluded. What is remaining is the hearing of the case as to compensation and as to whether any damage or negligence can be attributed to anyone. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

The seed for this high oil E content was supplied by Messre. Oil Crop development Company other farmers however, including those from Kibauni and Kalawa Locations in Hachakos District decided to grow sunflower from their own seed. This is the low oil content sunflower. It has an oil content of 32 per cent. Such farmers are paid Shs.l.80 per kilogramme.(c)	In view of the answer to (a), part (b) of the Question does not arise. MR. MUNYAOs Mr. Speaker Sir, I totally disagree with the ; answer givenby the Assistant Minister. This is because when the sunflower was being collected from the centres. there was an area manager in Hachakos. who had graded all the sunflower collected as high grade seeds. They collected 30.847 kg of hybrid seeds in Kachakos button they changed the grade. Why did they change the grade of the seeds after they had already been graded?Mr. MUIGAI s Mr. Speaker, Sir. my information is that the oil seed bad low oil contente I would appreciate any information that the hon.

Next Order.</Newspeech>COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY (Order for Committee rend being Seventh Allotted pay)<Header> MOTION </Header> That Mr. Speaker do now leave the Chair Vote 14 Ministry of Transport and Communications <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr.Magugu ) : Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to move that Mr.Speaker do now leave the Chair. The Development and Recurrent Votes of the Ministry of Transport and Communications have grown with the years since 1963,and right now, as I stand in this House,we are seeking approval for a SUE of some K£85 million to enable us to go about our activities some of them of development and others of recurrent nature.Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have different sections in the Ministry and Departments Some of the^re very major, and for that reason, I will refer the hon. Members who would wish to know in details about development programmes of the Corporations belonging to the Ministry to their respective Development Plans. For instance, the Kenya Ports Authority have their own Development Plan for the next five years which runs concurrently with the Government Development Plan. Also the Kenya Airways Corporation has the same. The Kenya Fests and Telecommunications has the same, The Kenya Railways Corporation has also the same. Therefore,I shall not go into details of how these Development Plans of these Corporations are achieved)Mr. Speaker, Sir major or most of our activities in the Ministry do surround the read construction and development.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Contd.): The Ministry spends a lot of money in developing or constructing and reconstructing roads throughout the Republic. It is the aim of the Government and, in fact, it is the declared, policy of the Government, that ail roads will be tarmackede. All roads will lead to market areas, tourists and other areas which benefit, or which bring benefit to the country. If you bear with me, on my right hand side, I think there is too much noise going on, Can you request hon. Members to give us time to go on with business?Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is for that reason that the Ministry is seeking these Development and Recurrent Funds so that we may be able to operate and provide what is required of us by the members of the public. In achieving our aims, we deos through various organisations within the Ministry0 For instance, we have the Roads Department which is charged with the designing., construction and supervision of roads thereof. We have also a Department which deals with roads maintenance0 We also have a Department which deals with materials, aerodromes, staff training and so on. This Department of Training has been doing a very good job over areas which require urgent attention when money have been provided for. It is a very useful organ within the Ministry. Then we have the Civil Aviation Department which does with exactly what it implies. I dare say here, Sir, that all those members of staff, particularly those who are appointed to head these very important organisations and corporations, Are done soon merit? nothing tribal, nothing to do with friendship, and nothing to do with anything else other than merit and professionalism. I am happy hon. Mwachofi is in agreement with that Mr. Speaker, Sir, 1987/88 Financial Year, we will see, within the Ministry, construction, of mo renew roads that are based on the priorities given to the Ministry through the district development</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Contdo): committees (D.D.C.) of the various districts of the Republic, Now, those projects have their funds voted and the D,D,C. do give us their priorities. In some cases, you will find that Constituency Members of Parliament go to the Ministry or plead with the Ministry that such and such a road be done "Can this road be tarmac ked?" We may be able to do so, but we do so subject to the recommendations by the D.D.C.'s and of course, subject to money being available, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important that we do develop these Road so It is also important that hon. Members of this House do agree and understand that the rate or the demand for new roads far exceeds the money provided for this development. Not only that When we do put up new roads in the Republic, one of the major areas we have to get concerned about is the area of maintenance. I am happy to point out here that some of the donors have come up with a request that whenwe fund a road we should also think in terms of its maintenance.This is because when a road has been done and completed, may be after two or three years it will require regular maintenance, as all hon. Members know. Therefore, I can here give the example of the recently constructed road traversing Embu and Meru.It is commonly known as "Thuci Nkubu Road" which has been funded on grant basis by the British Government. They have also agreed to provide maintenance funds for it. If, for example, those hon. Members coming from the North Eastern Province would stop somewhere like Is oil and look at that road, Is oil Nanyuki, they would notice that that road needs complete reconstruction. If hon. Members would look from Kakamega westwards, that road is also in that serious condition, and very many roads are of that nature. We are now in the process of negotiating for funds and we hope that we will be able to get some donors who will be generous enough to come to our assistance. The money we areasking for here new are feaels to meet our Development and Recurrent Expenditures. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Ctd):Mr. Speaker, Sir it is important that roads, and this is why we base our implementations from the recommendations of the district development centres(D.D.C.). are maintained. Some roads, for exorable between here and Eaali or Loitokitok which are in a very productive area have been ignored for years and years. The slopes of Mr. Kilimanjaro are very productive and. we can grow beans onions, peppers and many others there. These items must reach the markets, Those items must be sold so that the economy of the area and for that matter the economy of the country is strengthened. It is unfor¬tunate and. I restate that we cannot provide all the services that are expected from us. We cannot provide all the roads; we cannot even repair all the roads which need repairing immediately? and we cannot open up new roads. All we can do is to go within our provisions which are before this House.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the roads as already evidenced are very badlypotholed. It is unfortunate that the road users specially those who use heavy equipment have not heeded our advice against over loading. It is also unfortunate that we do have to keep reminding members of the public of the need to maintain funds for construction and maintenance. Our maintenance Vote has been reduced considerably. Last year we had estimated to spend K£8 million, but this year we are only having something like K£ 3.6 million which literary covers half of the maintenance Vote. I would therefore appeal through you Mr. Speaker to the members of the public and the road users that we as the Government have decided that we are going to reintroduce the weigh bridges all over the country in an attempt to curb over¬loading by our reckless road users. Earlier on when we suspended weigh brid&es9 we were used to seeing their stationed at an obvious place for example,, Naivasha. Gilgilj, Busia or  Kariakani. This is not going to be the case this time. We have been able to get mobile weigh bridges and? Therefore the ones we are</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (ctd): going to use are going to be stationed temporarily at points which we may deci.de at random. Therefore, we are going to have one weighing bridge or random checking and that is all. So after defecting overloading even by one vehicle, then we can move that weigh bridge to another station, maybe to another province or to another district. That means we have enough equipment to carry out spot-checks across the country so that within one or two days we will be able to know whether the regulations and rules are being followed.Therefore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to appeal to our people through you, to ensure that overloading is brought to a minimum.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATION (ctd.) :Mr. Speaker, Sir, when I say that, I have in mind the heavy transporters like the Coast Haulers and Yusuf Transporters et cetera, on the Thika road. Eventually, we are going to move heavy . transportation from roads to railways. The Kenya Railways Corporation should be able to help. For that reason, the Government is investigating on we and means of making the Kenya Railways Corporation more competitive than it is today. We are not comfortable because we do not have the capacity of the equipment we would like to have. We are short of locomotives, wagons and the line itself. God willing, we should' also be thinking along the lines of establishing a second railway line between Mombasa and Nairobi and, eventually and finally, on to the border at Malaba. It is important that the Kenya Railways Corporation gets all the support we can give it.At this juncture, we have been fortunate because the International Development Association (I.D.A.) has agreed to make available to the Kenya Railways Corporation an amount of $28 million towards that development. Once equipped, we should see the regeneration of our economy moving towards the right direction. That also goes for the Kenya Ports Authority, where we intend to obtain loans to help us reconstruct the Port. That is one of the very viable projects of the Government and one sometimes wonders why when a project like that one needs to be revitalized, because it only needs revitalization for the good of this country and its economy, the hon. Member for But ere is not thinking along with us. I hope he will think along with us because this project requires urgent attention and concerted efforts and a lot of support because right now, we are facing competition. We are not afraid of competition but we are facing competition between us at the Port of Mombasa and             THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (ctd.): Dar as Salaam, Beira and other ports further down,. I believe it is upon us, as a nation to seize the opportunity to be providing facilities which are not otherwise available at the ports of Dar es Salaam, Beira and further south. Therefore, I shall only plead with the hon. Members that when it comes to discussing that part-icular item, we shall get the support necessary for the Govern¬ment to guarantee the loan.Right now, the Port is dilapidated because some of thestructures we are talking about here are 50 or 52 years old. Do we wait until the structures collapse? I am sorry to say that some of the "big liners have now started diverting their ships for fear of using these very old facilities and, thereby, either losing lives or their ships. It is for that reason that I expect hon. Members, to agree with the proposals put here by the Minister for Finance on behalf of the Kenya Ports Authority and the Ministry of Transport and Communication; that we do approve the borrowing by the Kenya Ports Authority. These things are not done on tribal or individual basis not on, personalities; they are done on merit and professionalism itself.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to appeal to themembers of the public, through you, to be more reasonable in theway they use roads. Every time one comes to this House, hehears of a crash involving a bus, mat at u or lorry. We have donethe best we can. The House has enacted laws which should be followed. It is unfortunate and unexplainable that even after passing the Traffic Amendment Act of May, 1985, accidents seem to be on the increase/and not decreasing. I shall plead with hon. Members of this House that we should educate cur people matatu users and operators. The matatu operators should be more reasonable.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (ctd,): They should know that they are carrying human beings. Practically every third accident on our roads involves a matatu. I do not know whether it is because drivers have not had enough experience, in spite of the Government saying that we shall require drivers to obtain their certificates at the age of 21 years, but it is unfortunate that we have been experiencing an upward surge of accidents even though we have passed laws and amendments have been enacted.Mr. Speaker, Nairobi is notorious; the Nairobi Mombasa road and the Nairobi Eldoret Kakamega road are also notorious for accidents. I dare say that when members of the public and hon. Members of Parliament face these road" users and tell them they are not helping the country and their passengers, and that if anything, they are going to kill them, as they are now doing, then road accidents might decrease. We want to educate these people through all kinds of media so that we preach better use of our roads. It is through all institutions we go to that we should educate these people so that we can arrest this situation. Otherwise it is so and so who has been crashed today, and tomorrow it will be you and me. Therefore, I would like to say that this is not the role of the Ministry of Transport and Communications, the Registrar of Motor Vehicles or the Police alone; it is the role of any well- intentioned Kenyan to see to it that nothing continues to take the very valuable lives out of our families, out of our homes, and from among our friends.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (ctd):Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not want to repeat what I have said before, but the Ministry of Transport and Communications is grateful for all the support we have received from time to time from hon. Members. I dare say that some of the issues raised in this House may require resources going beyond our capability to provide, but we do take care of those requirements through the normal budgetary exercises. I also look forward to continued support from the hon. Members and from this House.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENERGY AND REGIONALDEVELOPMENT (Mr. Mwicigi): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to second the Minister1s Vote. He has done a very good job to explain the problems and what the Ministry is trying to do. To run a Ministry of such a magnitude with so many demands, there must be a lot of problems and above all when there', is a limited amount of money to use because each Ministry has its own r: share of the national cake which has to be shared according to the needs and demands of each Ministry and that is what the is doing. We thank him for that. I would also like the Minister know that there is a lot to be done in that Ministry. Officers from his Ministry are here in large numbers and we know that they are taking their Vote very seriously. There are many roads which require, to be constructed; while constructing very good roads, you have to think very seriously about the maintenance of those good roads. The Minister has mentioned about the problem of pot holes which are many and if they are not sealed, they get worse and may cause accidents on our roads. So, something must be done to minimise them or make sure there are fewer pot holes on our roads to make motoring easier.</Newspeech>				<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENERGY AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Mwicigi(Ctd):There is also something, which I believe the Ministry is going to give a very serious thought; this is where there are bottle necks Roads should be constructed without any delay0 When you take Nairohi Isiolo Garissa Road, for example, there is a section which has, perhaps, the highest traffic in the whole of the Republic. It has been waiting for a dual carriage road for a long time. It has even been mentioned in my presence by His Excellency the President, once or twice. The section in question is that, small section between Thika and Kakutano which is about four kilometres,, There are a lot of accidents on that road and most of them occur- within that small section® Survey and estimates have been done and we believe when the Ministers will consult his files, he will see that the users of the road have been complaining about this section® We hope that he might consider budgeting for a dual carriage way for this road because it has taken long While he is looking into that problem. I would like to remind him that there is also another road which is not tarmacked. It is required to be made an all weather road. The road in question is Njabini Gatura road which passes through a forest. There is an existing road here which was murrarm once, but the murrain has now been washed out by the rain® If this road is maintained it would assist people who move from various areas in Central Province because they would not need to pass through Nairobi. </Newspeech><Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENERGY AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Mwicigi )(Ctd. )There are other easier routes they can take and this can also bring about improved communication resulting into a lot of trade and commerce between these areas. Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we are talking about roads, we cannot leave out the question of bridges. At the moment, there are quite a few bridges which require attention. Even if a road is very good and it has no bridge, it does not serve any useful purpose. This is because vehicles cannot cross to the other side. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I feel that the Ministry should place its priorities where they are required. The Minister something about mentioned railways services. As we know the railway is the carrier of heavy goods, industrial and otherwise. The railway-line exists but what is not there can easily be replaced because when Kenya borrows money from overseas from countries and elsewhere, we always repay. Therefore ? I do not see why we cannot borrow money to maintain the railway and replace what is missing so that we do not have to have too many distances holding back development just because when ships bring goods to Mombasa, there is no way of bringing those goods for Nairobi.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I agree with what the Minister said about the matatus. Various regulations have been made to make sure that we reduce the rate of accidents on our roads. However, let us accept the fact that without matatus today, there is no way in which people can travel from the rural areas to the urban areas. The matatrus have done a very goodjob in that they have made the people mobile throughout the Republic although they have suffered quite a lot. I think they get worse publicity than they deserve, When it come to insurances, the way the matatu owners are told to pay for these insurances, is like telling them that they should not operate</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENERGY AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr.Mwicigi)(Ctd.) their matatus on the roads. However, if these matatus sirs do not operate, a lot of other complications would arise. So, I think that we should be a little bit lenient on the matatus and has helping their owners. If it is a question of having experienced drivers, we can make a regulation requiring the drivers to have as many years driving experience as we require them to have. However, let us look for ways and means of helping these matatu owners.Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have always wondered whether vehicles are not over checked. When I am going to my constituency from Nairobi,I find that within a distance of 40 kilometres or between here and Thika, sometimes there are three or four different police roadblocks. and at each road¬block, the venicleris examined and thoroughly looked at and at times you see the police and the driver having some kind of conversation. After that when the vehicle: goes to the next road 1 the same exercise is repeated on the same vehicle. If there was something wrong a that vehicle, could the first roadblock really not sort out the problem instead of the vehicle being subjected to another re examination at another roadblock almost after every ten kilometres; All these roadblock are different and I feel that this is something which the Minister can look at and the passengers to reach their places of work in good time instead of having to pass through so many police checks on the roads.With those few remarks, I beg to second. </Newspeech>(Question proposed.)<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Maiyard) ; Thank you very much, Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunityto support this Vote. Indeed,. the amount of money that the Minister isrequesting is not a large one considering the problem of transport</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Kr. Maiyani)(ctd.):    in this country which is fast developing. Indeed, I am saying this because of the problems in the rural areas which now need attention we need to develop businesses and industries in the rural areas and stop the young population from coming to Nairobi, Kisumu, Mombasa or to other large towns to look for employment. We would have developed many places if we had good roads. I am saying this with a bit of selfishness because Mukurni in Nyeri District is hard-hit in this road transport problem. I have written letter and spoken to officers, both in the Ministry's Headquarters and in the province emphasi¬zing the need to tarmac the road from Kukurwedni to Sagana.</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: Do you have copies of those letters? </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER: OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Maiyani):	Yes, I do. This road has been s designed and surveyed and the only problem is lack of money and this is why I am supporting this Vote, So, when the Minister sits with his officers to allocate this money, I v/ould like to appeal to him to include this road. Mukurwesini would be enjoyed railway services had it not be for an old chief of that time who felt that the noise made by the locomotive engine when moving would bring bad spirits Mukurweni and scare men, goats and cows. I am not saying that this is the case today and therefore, I would like to beg the Minister to consider this road which is very short. It is about kilometres from Kukurweini to Sagana. When this road is completed, it will shorten the distance from Othaya to Sagana and from the north eastern part of Kurang to Sagana? from Aguthi and thinking locations where most of the coffee produced in Kyeri and northern part of Muranga, would be transported to Sagana via this very short distance.Today, Mukurueini; being the southern part of Nyeri, is only about threekilometres to Sagana. However, coffee is transported from that place toKaratina and then down to Sagana which makes is very expensive and</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT (Mr. Maiyani)(Ctd.): money wasting on part of the coffee farmer, We know that the economyof this country is mainly backed by coffee and tea from 0thay4ya and otherparts of Nycri. I would be very conveniently transported to Nairobithrough this road. The distance would be much shorter and therefore, Iam begging the Minister, with all due respect, to consider seriously tarrnacking this road. My people in Mukurweini and in the entire Nyeri Population would be very grateful indeed if this road was tarmacked.With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MRS. ASIYO: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir,  for allowing me to contribute to this Motion. Mr. Speaker, Sir,I would like to congratulate the Ministry for Transport and communications for having the challenges that most of their departments and the corporations We know that a lot remains to be done in almost every department and almost every corporation, but I think all of them have tried very hard in the first year. It is for this reason,that I stand to support the allocation of these funds to the Ministry.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also wanted to thank the Ministryfor having started the Paponditi Kendu Bay road which have been ,discussed for many years. We see that the work is now started and everybody is very happy in that area. We are also very grateful to that same department for having built, the Ongethe bridge which has been a killer in central Karachuonyo for many years. The bridge is now complete andeverybody in that area is very happy. There are very manygood things that this Ministry has done, especially on provision of telephone service as well as the provision of Post Offices, service in many parts,	only in Karachuonyo but also in other parts of this country.	I would like to appeal to this Ministry to £a establishpost offices in all the markets so that people especially old people do not have to walk for long distances to post letters or buy stamps.	Mr. Speaker, Sir, we know that communication is a real basic requirement for economic development and especially rural development really depends upon activities such as opening of the minor roads to markets, to primary or secondary schools, to fish beaches along the lake, to health centres and so on. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MRS. ASIYO (CTD.):Now, this is one area which is still lacking especially in my Constituency and, I therefore wanted to appeal to the Minister to think about areas such as South Nyanza district which, for example, forms per cent of the Nyanza Province. If the same allocation that is made to Siaya, Kisuxnu or Kisii is given to Nyanza Province, it is going to be almost impossible in terms of personnel, machinery, and the volume of work. For these people to do their work well, I think the Minister should consider posting more road engineers to South Nyanza District because it almost half of the Nyanza Province, and he should give more funds for projects in that particular district because it is a much bigger district than these other districts. He should also give machinery especially roads construction machinery.Mr. Speaker, Sir, most of the roads in South NyanzaDistrict are not good. We know of many districts in thiscountry where most roads have been well tarmacked made all weather roads including the minor roads. The Minister should now be able to move these machineries from the so called developed districts to the under developed districts such as the one that I am referring to.(Applause)The disparity between the poor districts and the rich and potential districts, is too wide. We need to communicate just like people in other districts in this country so, the Minister will have to reorganise his priority in accordance with the requests from the district development committees.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MRS. ASIYO (CTD.):Mr. Speaker, Sir, now, there is a need to tarmac the Kendu Bay Oyugis road. This is only a 20 kilometre road. In the 1980/81 Financial Year, there was a £10 allocation whichwas indicative of the interest that the Ministry had on the road. We do not know where this £10 gone to I would mowlike to appeal to the Minister to think of allocating fundsto this very important road. There are also some minor roads which are very useful in Karechuonyo, like D219; E213 and E1028. These are roads which lead from the, lake to the upper areas where the markets are. The fishermen cannot readily transport their fish from the lake to these areas, and most of the times the fish get rotten before they reach the markets and this is a very big loss to people whose economy almost entirely depends e£ on fishing. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MRS. ASIYO(CTD.);Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a very important bridge called Samba which connects Kabondo Kasipul and Karachuonyo. This bridge is important in that the fishermen who have to take their fish from the lake to Oyugis have to go all the way up to Kendu Bay before they can get matatus to Oyugis Market. I, therefore; want the Minister to think about the Saraba Orinda Bridge in East Karachuonyo.Mr. Speaker, Sir, other areas where a lot of good work has been done arc the railways and harbours, but we want to appeal to them to do something better this so time that their work can be seen. If have not seen any new railway line in our area since Independence, and we do not know what is happening. So, the areas of railways and harbours must expand physically and also expand services. For instance, we should now have trains going to Kisuau and Mombasa, leaving after every sixhours because? there is demand. The Kenyan people have become mobile and they are going everywhere; we have a young generations composed of people who are always going round to look for jobs and to do trade. Unless, therefore, we have a sufficient system of transportation, our small scale businessmen who can only use ±z trains, buses and matatus are going to be hit hard. I want to thank the Kenya Railways Corporation for facelifting the Kendu Bay Station, and I want to appeal to the Minister to urge them to build a station at Miti Bill as well as Sondu Bay in Karaclruonyo because this will make the transportation of people, fish and livestock much more easier and convenient to the people in that area. I just wanted to commend the Kenya Railways and Harbours Corporation for having the cleanest of offices in Nairobi. Those people who go round Government offices and elsewhere know the type of stench they find, especially if the toilets are adjoined to the offices. I want to urge hon. Members of Parliament to go round and see the offices of the Kenya Railways because that Corporation has really set a good example. I think the Minister for Health should visit the Kenya Railways Offices and have a look so that can loarn to be a little bit healthier at their headquarters.With those few remarks, I beg to support the Motion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me thisopportunity to contribute to this Motion. First of all, I would like to thank the Minister for Transport and communication for the good job he is doing. When I say this I am not pretending .It is because the Minister for Transport and Communications does not rely on information from his officers in the fields. One of the weaknesses of our Ministers is that of readying the information they got from their field officers without going to see exactly what the officers are doing. The Minister for Transport and Communications has been going round the country; we have been hearing and seeing the Minister going round checking on what his officers are doing, and that is why I sincerely thank him.Mr. Speaker, Sir, having said that, I must also thank the Ministry of Transport and Communications for establishing the Kenya National Shipping Line. Asyou know, the Government has been promising this House that shipping would be established since the collapse of the defunct East African Shipping Line on the 27th of March, 1980. Although the start is good, I do not think the practice of buying space on ships is good. I do not know whether we are going to benefit from such an arrangement as we expected because when you buy slots on ships you cannot employ he your people. The best method to run a shipping line is to buy our ownShips go that we can benefit as a marine country. As a marine country, we are supposed to get 40 per cent of the export foreign earnings and another 40 per cent of the import . foreign exchange earnings. The remaining 20 per cent is what we can compete on. Why should the Ministry plan to be buying slots rather than buying our own vessels? It is better to buy our own vessels so that we can employ our own people. Today we have more than 2,000 seamen H who are unemployed. We have marine officers and chief engineers who an were working with the East African National Shipping Line and who are now underemployed; they are working with the Kenya Port Authority although they were not trained to work there. Those people were trained to work in deep sea going vessels. In fact, they were ±k trained for more than 10 years. It is not good to have a seaman who has been trained for 10 years working on a tug. Those officers must be utilised, and they cannot be properly</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU (ctd.):utilised unless we have our own ships,Mr. Speaker, Sir, I appreciate that the Government has invited Unimach Company of West Germany, but they must be careful with that company. This is the same company which was running the East African National Shipping Line. The Govern¬ment must, therefore, be very careful with this company because it might benefit more and make the Kenya Shipping Line lose.Sir, having thanked the Minister for the good job he is doing, I must also pinpoint some weaknesses. When Kagongo road was tarmacked, we were very happy with the Ministry of Transport and Communications. But that road did not last for more than two months. When I investigated the cause of the deterioration of the road, I was told that the contractor was given wrong specifications; he applied the wrong materials which were not meant for the road. Why should the Ministry allow a contractor to use the wrong materials to construct a road like this where a lot of money was used? When I asked a Question in this House, an a Assistant Minister for Transport and Communications promised this House that the road would the repaired. However, up to this moment, nothing of that nature has been done. I, therefore, do call upon the Minister to do something to this road. The condition of the road is even worse than it was before the road was tarmacked. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Magugu): On a point of information, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The answer which was given to the hon. Member was correct and still stands the same, that after this exercise of allocation of money, the work would be redone. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for what the Ass Minister has said.I will leave the issue of Magongo road and touch on the condition of roads such as Mogandishu, Zanzibar, Dares Salaam and Shimanzi in Shimanzi area. Those are very important roads because they are the ones which connect Mombasa Port and Mainland. If you go there  and I request the Minister to visit these places next time he goes to Mombasa you will find that Shimanzi area fills up with</Newspeech><Newspeech>MK. KILIKU (ctd. ):"swimming pools" arid the roads become completely impassable. I do not know why the condition of these roads should be left like this when, in fact, Shimanzi is an industrial place. When the Minister goes to ±k Mombasa next time, he should go to this place and find out whether we are talking the truth.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the parastatal bodies tinder the Ministry of Transport and Communications, especially the Kenya Ports S Authority, for doing a very good job. In fact, the Kenya Forts Authority has been employing people without any form of in discrimination. This is the kind of attitude we want all corporations to adopt of employing all Kenyans without discrimination. I was working with the Kenya Railways Corporation and I, as the hon. Member of Parliament for the area where the Kenya Ports Authority is situated, I know that the Authority has been employing people without discrimination. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KTLIKU (ctd);All other parastatals should follow the example which has been set by the Kenya Ports Authority because it is a good example.In conclusion. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to say that for the last two weeks I have been travelling to Mombasa by air and I have witnessed one very important thing which the Minister for Transport and Communications should take note of. It is very un-economical to fly the Airbus from Nairobi to Mombasa with a quarter capacity. You can go to the Airport hoping to fly in a Boeing 707 but you are told that the plane cannot fly because of technical problems. Do we not have smaller aircraft which can carry a small number of passengers instead of flying the Airbus from Mombasa to Nairobi when it is almost empty? We cannot run our airline like that. That is why we are losing money.	I also thank the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications corporation  for the good job they have been doing. I think every district in this country will hava(STI) facilities in the near future. This is development. The Corporation has also installed telephone booths in my constituency. I urge them to continue doing that.Mr. Speaker, Sir, my time is gone - although I have a lot to say on this Ministry - and with those few remarks, I beg to support. </Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. MUTHCJRA: Thank you very much Mr. Speaker, Sir. First of all I would like to thank the Government through the Ministry of Transport and Communications and particularly the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications corporation . 'This is because they have spread telephone services to nearly all urban areas in this country. If you go to some of the small market centres in the rural areas you will find that they have got telephone services. The queueuing by wanancli is an indication that there has been a great need for telephone services.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MRo MUTHURA (ctd);	Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must thatnk the Kenya Posts andTelecommunications corporation for also improving the new Nanyuki Telephone Exchange. We have got more telephone lines and the wananchi are enjoying those telephone services. It was only yesterday when I visited the Site Camp at Naro Moru where the site agent told me that they will start the reconstruction of the killer road from Nanyuki to  Kiganjo which is a distance of 48 kilometres. A lot has been said about that road in this House. People from my constituency, and people from Isiolo and Marsabit districts are happy to learn that that particular road is going to be reconstructed. But when that section has been done there will still remain that bit between Kiganjo and Sagana and the bi between Makutano and Thika.- If these two sections are reconstructed this road from Nanyuki to Nairobi willbe very nice. I fe± hope that the Ministry will look into that.Mr. Speaker, Sir, in one of the local dailies, last week, the Minister for Transport and Communications was quoted as havingsaid that it was the wish and will of the Government that unnecessarily Loadsheavy loads should not be transported by road. It is a known fact that the Kenya Railways Corporation has no job. So, some of the goods being transported by road should be transported by rail. It is now called the Kenya Railways and not the former East African Railways Corporation. This means that whatever profit we make from the Kenya Railways will be for this country. The Minister for Transport and Communications is a Minister of action and I hope that he is going to act on this issue. The Ministry should fix a minimum tonnage of a load that can be transported by lorries on the roads. Kenya Railways is doing a good job. However there has been this long outstanding proposal to extend the Nairobi to Nanyulcl railway line to Meru. I think we have been told something to this effect. All the goods from Meru to Nanyuki are transported by road. These heavy lorries play a major part in damaging our roads.I therefore hope that the Ministry is going to look into this with a critical mind so that this railway line is extended from Nanyuki to Meru.At the same time, many c years "back, there was a passenger train plying "between Nairobi and Nanyuki. But now people from that- side are crying. This is because the fares charged by matatu and bus operators are just too high. I believe that travelling by railway is cheaper than travelling by road. I therefore, appeal to the Minister to do something about this problem. I can see that the Managing Director of Kenya Railways Corporation is here with us today. Let him look into this matter with a lot of humanity." This is because wananchi are crying for this service. 'The passenger train service between Nairobi and Nanyuki should be reinstated. You cannot milk a cow which you are not feeding, The Minister is getting a lot of money from the road toll stations in this country." Let him use that money to repair the roads through which this revenue is obtained. We know that there are three major roads which have toll stations; from Nairobi to Nakuru, Nairobi to Mombasa and from Nairobi to Nanyuki I feel that it will be unfair if the Minister collects all this money which amounts to millions and millions of pounds and fail to use the money to repair and maintain the roads n from which it has been collected. We are the people who pay this moneyo.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS(MR. Magugu):On a point of order, Mr, Speaker, Sir, Is the hon. Member not misleading the House when he talks about "millions and millions of pounds"? We collect only KShs.3 million every month from the road the hone Member has just referred to. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTHURA: Mr, Speaker, Sir, if they collectShs.3 million per month from that road then it amounts toShs.35 million per year. How much do they collect from the other two roads. It amounts to millions and millions of shillings. So, the Minister should use the little money he collects to repair and maintain those roads.Every day we read about deaths caused by road accidents and I am happy the Minister has mentioned this. What is the Minister, and the Government as a whole,doing to reduce these deaths? This is because road accidents are claiming more lives than diseases. I think doctors should look into this problem critically. This is because we are losing a lot of lives on our roads. A way of alleviating these deaths should be found.Mir. Speaker, Sir, sometime this year it was reported in the Press that drivers who were carrying bogus insurance covers on their vehicles had been arrested. If this is the case then the situation is extremely dangerous. If this would happen to a matatu operator who would have a bogus insurance We know what would happen. If this matatu or bus is involved in a road accident there will be nobody to pay for the loss of lives and for the injuries. I think the question of insurance for these passenger vehicles should be scrutinised so that we do not have any tiling of that kind. We know that this is a very dangerous games With these few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS AND SETTMENT  (Mr. Nassir): Asante eana, Bw.

Baada ya wao kuandikia ripoti 5rao vizuri, jambo ambalo wangefanya ni kuweka ripoti juu ya Mcza ya Bunge hili, tuijadili, tujue Kama.kulikuwa na makosa au la ili vale waliokosa warekebishwe. Kwa njia hii mali ya uinma ingelindwn taliadaa. Ni jambo la kushangaza, Bw. Spika, kwamba mpaka lco ripoti hiyo haijaletwa hapa na iraechukua karibu mwaka mmoja. Hii ni aibu na lcama haitaletwa, itakuwa ni kupuuza uwezo na wajibu wa, Bunge hili. Ikiwa uwezo na wajibu va Bungo hili utapuuzwa, basi itakuwa ni kuwapuuza wananchi wa nchi hii.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHUKU: Jambo la nidhamu, Bw. Spika. Ninayafuata yale yanayosemwa na mhe. Mbunge na ningependa atwarobie ni ripoti gani na| mwaka . gani ambayo haijaletwa katika Bunge hili na ambayo ni kinyume cha mahitaji ya Bunge hili.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWACHQFI: Bw. Spika, ninafikiri hili ni jambo linalojulikanawazi. Eufuatana na sheria ya Exchequer, ikiwa kuna makosa katika idara au Yiizara, Mkaguzi wa Fedha za Serikali anatakiwa aandike ripoti maalum. Mwaka ulippita , alifanya hivyo kuhusu Shirika la Posta na £irau. Ripoti hiyo ilichelewa kuletwa hapa na ililetwa wakati tulipouliza Swali hapa. Kamati ya Bunge inayohusika ikjakaa, ikachunguza jambo hili na .ikaleta ripoti hapa. Hatua ya rawisho ilikuwa ni ripoti hii i Jet we hapa, Bunge hili £ilii jadil kwa jumla na litoke na uanruzi. Hii ndio sababu ninasema kwamba kutoletwa kvra ripoti hii ni makosa na kulinyima Bunge hili heshima. Ninamuunga Waziri mkono wakati alipotaja </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Magugu): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

Ikiwa kuna makosa,ninafilciri^ jca Waziri au</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Hagugu): On apoint of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I believe it is not a question of defending. or making counter accusations but I belive that the procedures or laying documents the Table of this House are clear. The Minister, at one stage, is required to lay the documents of the Ministry on the Table of this House. The A Controller and Auditor-General and the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee are also entitled to such documents. Therefore, at no one stage aid I fail to do that. I am very aware, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that at one stage, the report was not ready to be laid on the Table of this Souse. Therefore, I do not accept the claim that I failed to do that.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWACHOFI: Bw. Spika, ninacna wakati wangu mneikwisha na nilikuwa na mengi ya kusema, Ningcpenda Wasiri aangalie barabara inayoitwa A23 inayotoka Kwatate ku.elekea Taveta« Mwaka baada ya mwaka barabara. hii hutengewa £10 pake yake. Mwaka uliopita jlitengewa Shs. _6 milioni, na hata peni haikutumika.  Ningependa Waziri aeleze marnbo haya. atakapojibu.Ninaunga mkono.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MNARUWA: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me this chance. I would like to thank the Minister for bringing this Motion on time. The amount of money which the Ministry is requesting should be granted because this is one of the Ministries which is doing a lot of work for the wananchi. This Ministry actually caters for people's interests and it does its job very well. When the Airbus was bought, I way the first man to complain because the money which was used to buy the it lirbes, should h have been used to buy four to five ships. How we have a Kenyan-owned National Shipping Line, which does not have ships. I do not know how we are going to run it.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWARUWA (Contd.):I do not known he is going to run it. Nevertheless, we do not blame the Minister because he is not going to finish everything. But I would urge the Government to do something. It is high time the Government did somethings It should see to it that it owns its own ship so that the wananchi of this country can benefit by getting, says employment from their own ships. We have had very many local seamen who are jobless and they cannot get employment except from foreign ships. This is where we get a lot of suffering from some of these foreign ships,	For instance, in  1984, we had this or problem of the who were thrown in the high seas simply because the Kenya Government did not own any ship. Some years back, the Government owned some ships. This is when we had the first sister countries: Kenya, Tanzania Uganda and Zambia. Unfortunately, we do not know what happened, Maybe the Minister at that time was not very capable. He was not as capable as this Minister now who can handle things properly. That is why we lost all the ships. In fact, we are left; with a lot of debts. Now, instead of complaining, so much or instead of arguing with the Government, we kindly request the Minister, whom we think he is very capable, to do something. Since he took over this Ministry, we have seen many things going smoothly and nicely. That is why the Kenya Ports Authority was able to make a very big profit. That is not easy because in this Government we have very many Ministries and parastatal bodies. Now, out of all those parastatal bodies, when we get the Public Accounts Committee Report, we find that very many of these parastatal bodies have squandered a lot of money and are left with big loans to repay. However, today I was very happy to hear that the Kenya Ports Authority has done its best and has kept a name in making a lot of profit for this country,,Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have to understand that the Kenya Ports Authority is a big firm. This must be clearly known. It is a very big firm. It is not a small firm like the Coca-Cola Company and so on. It is a key of this country. If Anything goes wrong at the Port it can create a lot of damage to the Government and to the whole country. So the man who has been assigned to work there should be given time to concentrate properly rather than to be kicked out every now and then. Otherwise, he will at be able to do his job properly.Mr. Speaker, Sir, if it is a question of squandering money, only very few people have not squandered money. Even myself, about I have squandered money. So, instead of complaining that, let us leave it at that. But the position we are now at, as the Secretary General of the Seamen Union, I want us to have a ship to make sure that members of my union can be employed,. That is the most important thing in this Vote, We have been able to get the airbuses and we have enjoyed, but again the airbus does not recruit more than 15 people. Sometimes it can only recruit about 10 or 12 people, but a ship can recruit about 45 or 50 people. The money which bought one airbus could at least buy about six ships. Now, when you take about 50 crew members for employment for one ship and multiply chat by five, you will find that many citizens of this country would be able to get employment.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I now come to the question of roads. The Ministry is part of the Kenya Government. When we talk about the Ministry, any Ministry is part of the Kenya Government. In Mombasa North, we have this road from Mwembe Tayari to Nyali Reef Beech Hotel We used to have the Kenya Bus Services there. But it is now about three years ago since they stopped the service. I brought a Motion here and a Question regarding that road and no action was taken.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWARUWA (Contd.):Surprising the Kenya Bus Services is not part of the Kenya Government INew, The Kenya Bus Services said that they are not going to renderservices on that road, and the Ministry which is part of the Governmentdid not take any action. I wonder: Who is more powerful than theother, the Kenya Bus Services as a Company, or the Ministry which ispart of the Government? So, by bringing this matter here I do notmean that I am against the Ministry. But it is a matter of requestingthe Ministry to exercise its powers to ensure that the Kenya BusServices Company has gene back to render services to that area. Ifit does not, then the Ministry has power to cancelthe licences of the Kenya Bus Services Company unless some seniorofficers of the Ministry have some private interest in this company.This means that if two or three people have an interest in the KenyaBus Services Company and they make thousands and thousands of wananchisuffer, it is very bad. For instance, if you go to Nyali or Kongoweasyou will see very many people walking home. Sometimes they leavetheir work at 11.00 p.m. which is very dangerous to walk home. Thereare no buses to take them home. I do not see why the Minister is nottaking any action. Maybe by the time I brought my Motion into thisHouse the Minister himself was not in. But I am glad that he is </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr, Magugu):On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. It is not fair to say that the Minister is not taking any action. Action is already being taken, and I think there is a Committee which is working on this particular issue. I believe the report is yet to come. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWARUWA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, how long is the Ministry talking to deal with the Kenya Bus Services Company? Again, the Minister is telling me that there is a Committee which is looking into this matter and a report will be brought here. Thousands of citizens are suffering. However, I am pretty sure that if thosebuses had stopped rendering services in areas where the Europeans and Asians lived, the Ministry would have taken action long way back* The Ministry is now not taking any action because it is the poor and black Africans who live on that side. This is why the Minister is not bothered at alls.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Magugu): Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is interesting because I believe that some ofthe frustrations which we are facing, are coming from the hands of our African friends, and not Wacungu or Wahindio So, I am happy that the hon0 Member brought that point. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MvARUWA; Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is me and my children and my black friends who suffer. There are no buses at all. It is only a few matatus that operate there. I have only seen the police there stop the matatu and check them. They delay people while going to work. Some Africans have been sacked from their jobs simply because there is no transport. That is why I support this Ministry to get this money. We approve this money,	we want you, as the Minister, to take drastic action against the Kenya Bus Services Company» There is no point for us to come here, talk gently and beg. There is no point for us to come and beg. The Government is ours and the Kenya Bus Services Company, after all, is a foreign  company. I do not see the reason why we have to,keep on pleadings We should take a drastic actions If they do not render the services on that side, we should cancel the licences, and allow other transport companies to operate  from that side.	With those few remarks, Sir, I strongly support the Minister to get the money.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR COMMERCE(Mr. Lalampaa) : Ahsante sana Bw. Spika kwa kunipa fursa hii ili nanri niweze kuseraa machache kuhusu Hoja hii ya Wizara ya Mawasiliano na U_chukuzi. ITingependa kuiunga mkono k Ho ja hii kwa sahabu ni ya maana saha.Ewanza kabisa, n.ingependa kuchukua nafasi hii kumpongeza Waziri wa Wizara hii kwa vile alivyowasilisha makisio ya Wizara yake na vile vile kuwapongeza maofisa wake wote ambao wamef ika hapa Bungeni^ili kusikiliza mambo yatakayozungumzwa kuhusu Wizara yao. Ukiangali viti vya watumishi wa Serikali katika Bunge hili, utaona kwamba, vimejazwa na maofisa hao. Tunaelewa ka kwamba maofisa, hawa wote wanatoka kwa kila sehemu Wizara hii pamoja na Mashirika ya Serikali ya Wizara hii.[Mr. Speaker left the Chair][The Deputy Speaker took the Chair]Bw. Naibu Spika, Wizara liii inafanya kazi ambayo inafthusukila mwananchi wa nchi hii kila siku kv/a sababu kama mtu h anatembeakwa kutumia barabara, angani, baharini, Wizara hii inahusika. Vile vileY/izara hii inahusika katika mawasiliano na mambo mengine mengi. Kwa hivyo, Wizara hii ni "ya U muhimu sana kwa maisha ya wananchi na kwa maenaeleo ya nchi hii yetu ya Kenya.Nampongeza Waziri kwa kutaja mipango yake ya kutengeneza barabara muhimu katika nchi hii, na nafurahi kwa sababu ametaja barabara mo Ja kubwa ambayo imetengenezwa kwa vipande, labda kwa sababu ya ukosefu Wa fedha. Barabara ninayozuo gumza juu yake ni A2 - Nairobi-Addis Ababa Highway. Barabara hii .imeTENGEWUZWN na Wizara fcti laiai mpaka. Isiolo na lama sehemu nyingine ya mchanga ambayo inaliitaji ku kuweKwa lami. Hii sehemu ni leutoka Isiolo mpalca Moyale. Barabara hii ni ya kimataifa na ni, muhimu kwa uchumi wa nchi hii yetu ya Kenya. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR COMMERCE (Mr. Lalampaa) (ctd.) :Bw. Naibu Spika, barabara hii inaelekea kuwa mbaya, na ningeiomba Wizara ihakikishe kwamba imepata pesa za kuvWeka lami kutoka Isiolo mpaka Koyale. Hata kaina haiwezi kupata pesa za kuiwezesha kuweka lami katika sehemu hii yote ya barabara hii, inweza kuitengeneza kwa vipande. Kwa mfano, kn kipande cha kwanza kINNWEXA kutoka Isiolo mpaka Laisamis. Halafu kipande cha pili kinaweza kuwa kutoka Laizamis mpaka Moyale. Nasema hivi kwa sababu k tunajua kwamba utengenezaji wa barabara kwa lam hugharimu pesa nyingi na ni vigumu pesa hizo kupatikana mara mo kwa hiyyo hatuwezi lcungojea mpaka Wizara ipate pesa zote zitakazo wezesha utengenezaji wa barabara hii yote mara moja. Kwa hivyo, ningeiomba Wizara iiangalie barabara hiyo.Vile vile, nikizungumzia barabara hiyo hiyo, ningeiomba Wizara ifikirie barabara ya C79 - inayotoka Archer's Post kwenda Wamba na kutoka Wamba mpaka Maralal. Barabara hii ni zte muhimu katika uchumu wa nchi hii kwa sababu hutumika kwa ss kuwasaf irisha watalii. Watalii wakitoka Nairobi wanaenda Nyeri 11a kutembelea hoteli za Tree Tops na Outspa. Hotel. Wakitoka Nyeri, wanaenda Camburu Lodge. Kutoka Samburu Lodge, wanaenda Tented Camp iliyo Wamba. Kutoka hapo wanaenda Maralal Safari Lodge. Safari hiyo yote inaitwa northern circuit. Mwishowe wanaendaLake Baringo au Lake Turkana. Kwa hivyo, barabara hii ni muhimukwa uchumi wa nchi hii kwa sababu inatumiwa " kwa kuwasafirisha wataliiwengi sana. Kwa hivyo, Wizara ikipata pesa za Ioaweka lami,. pleasejust extend the tarmac to cover Wamba and that road junction - No. C79.Bw. Naibu Spika, ningependa pia kuyapongeza mashirika ya Serikali ya Wizara hii I yanayofanya kazi nzuri kwa wakati huu. Yale ambayo hayafanyi kazi aa nzuri yataonyeshwa mfano mzuri na yale ambayo yanafanya kazi nzuri. Kwa jumla, wakati umewadia kwa mashirika ya Serikali kuhakikislia kwamba yaaefanya vizuri kwa sababu</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR COMMERCE (Mr. Lalampaa) (cud.) : ukiangalia mashirika ya kibinafsi, utaona kwamba yanafanya vizuri sana. kwa nini mshirika. ya Serikali hayafanyi vizuri? Ni lazima yaangalie yaone kwamba yamefanya vizuri.Jambo lingine ambalo ningependa kulizungumzia ni lile la ajali za baxabarani, ambalo limetajwa na Waziri. Ni kweii kwamba Wakenya wanapoteza maisha kwa sababu.ya ajali za barabarani. IJafikiri hakuna jambo lingine lolote linalosababislia vifo vingi humu nchini kama ajali za barabarani. Watu wa Kenya watazidi kupoteza maisha lava sababu ya rafraffst tamaa ya pesa ya wenye^matatu na wenye mabasi. watu hawa wanashindana na kuwabeba watu kama magunia. Hawaf ikirii wanabeba maisha ya binadamu. |4£aya yao jia kuwabeba, watu wengi iwez ekanavyoj mara nyingi wezekanavyo kwa siku ili waweze kupata pesa za kuwawezesha lab da kulipia Edqo mikopo waliyoichukua kwa kununulia magari hayo." La.ki ni hat a kama ni hvyo, ni lazima wafikirie ma^isha ya binadamu na wajue kwamba maisha ya binadamu ni muhimu kuliko pesa.Jambo lingine la kusikitisha ni kwamba hata gari la moslii siku hizi hupata ajali. Sijui kama Ikimebadilika na kuwa matatu nap pia. Mara nyingi utasikia kwa redio au kusoma katika magazeti kwamba gari la moshi limeacha reli. Hapo mbeleni  hatukuwa k tukisikia matukio ya ajali a gari la moshi kama tunavyo- sikia siku hizi. Ningemwomba Waziri wa Mawasiliano na Uchukuzi. parnoja na maofisa wake wafanye uchunguzi wajue  ni kitu gani kilicho haxibika katika Shirika la Reli la Kenya kwa sabahu reli hazija- panuliwa na hakuna kitu kipya i kilicho ongezwa katika Shirika hili, labdo. tu magari ndiyo yameongezeka. Reli ni ile ile tu, na lava hivyo nashindw ni kwa nini ajali zinazidi kuongezeka na hali hazikuwako feasq? hapo mbeleni -Kama nilivyotaja hapo mbeleni, ni lazima watu wote wanao- husika na uchukuzi wa abiria wajue kwamba waneababisha upotevu wa maisha ya frsa. Njia moja ya kupunguza ajali za barabarani ni</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSIS I AND MINISTER FOR COMMERCE (Mr. Lalajnpaa) (ctd. ) :kwa mashirika mbali mbali kutoa tuzo kwa wale madereva wao wansfanyavizuri zaidi kwa muda fulani; hii iwe ni kama mashindano ya kushirikiwana Id.la dereva katika Kenya. Kenya Breweries ina mpango kama huu maderevaambapo madereva wa kampuni hii hushindana ambapo yule anaye fanya kazi bila kusababisha ajali kwa muda fulani hupewa tuzo. Ukianagala vizuri, utaona kwamba ajali zinazohusu malori ya kampuni liii huwa haba kweli—kweii. Hii ni kwa sababu dereva anajua kwamba asipofanya ajali kutokea, atapata zawadi.Bw. Naibu Spika, mashirika mbali mbali yafaa yafikiriekutoa kitu fulani aina. ya tuzo kwa Wizara ya Uchukuzi na Mawasiliano, cha	'kushindaniwa na madereva wote wa magari ya uchukuzi na ya abiria, ili kuhakiki slia kwamba maisha ya watu wetu yanaendelea kuliridwa na kuheshimiwa. Nasema hivi kwa sabau ukitembea katika barabara yoyote katika nchi hii, ± utaona, kwamba wanaohusika na usaf irishaji kama vile matatu. wazidi kuwajaza Efeg. abiria katika magari yao zaidi ya vile inavyotaid.kana. Matatu yanajasa abiria mpaka watu wengine wananing inia mlangoni wa nyuma. Waweza kuona kwamba mtu fulani amekanyaga kipandio chs. gari kwa mguu mmo ja nao mguu ule mwingine uko nje„ Wakati kama fey huo, gari ilcikanyanigwa kizuiz, mtu kama huyo "anaweza kuanguka chini.-Vile vile, ningependa Icuw akumbusha polisi kwamba ni wajibu wao kuhakiki sha kwamba hakuna gari iaaayeb-eba Eicc abiria zaidi ya idadi inajokubaliwa. Kwa hayo machache, naomba kuunga Hoja hii inkono. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MZAMIL: Ahsante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika, kwa kunipatia nafasi hiiili nizungurnze juu ya Voti hii. Kwanza, ningependa kusema kwamba Wizara hiiya Uciukuzi na Mawasiliano inafanya kazi muhimu sana katika nchi yetu tukufu. Kwa hivyo, ingefaa sisi kama Bunge tuipatie Wizara hii pesa zinazotakikanabila pin garnizi yoyote. Ningependa kusema machache kuhusu halmashauri fulaniza Serikali ambazo ni muhimu katika nchi hii. Kwa mfano, ningetaka kusema juuya Kenya Ports Authority ambayo ni moja ya halmashauri za Serikali ambazo zinapata faida kubwa sana katika nchi yetu na inasaidia katika mambo mengi sana. Ikiwahalmashauri hii inapata faida kubwa jinsi hii, bila shaka inahitaji kupeva nafasi zaidi ya kuweza kupanua kazi yake. Miaka sita au saba iliyopita, tulipitisha Hoja hapa Bungeni kwamba kuve na bandari ya pill katika Kenya na tukapitisha hapa kwamba bandari hii ya pili rtajengva Lamu. Feasibilitystudy ilifanywa lava siku nyingi sana na tukaambiva kwimba jambo hilo halikuwa tayari kuanzishwa. Kwa vile tumetambua kwamba bandari-inafanya kazi muhimu katika kazi ya kulijenga taifa, ningependa kumwomba Waziri kupitia kwako, By. Naibu Spika„ ahakikishe kwamba bandari ya pili inajengwa ili iwezeshe nchi yetu kuwapatia wananchi kazi za kutosha. Nasema hivyo kwa sababu hakuna kivanda cha aina yoyote katika sehemu ya Lamui.na kwa hivyo wananchi kule hawana nafasizozote za kazi. Wananchi katika sehemu hii wamekuwa wengi sana na ikiwa bandarihii itajengwa itaweza kuwasaidia. Halmashauri hii inapata pesa nyingi sanana kwa hivyo, inaweza kujenga bandari kule Lamu. Tulisikia kwamba tendazilitolewa katika nchi za nje na kwamba kuna nchi za kigeni ambazo zilijitolea kuijenga bandari ile na hatuoni sababu yoyote ya kulichelewesha jambo hili : namna hii. Kwa hivyo, ningetaka Halmashauri hii, pamoja.na Wizara, ifanye juhudi zake zote ili Hoja ambayo ilipitishwa hapa Bungeni, kwamba bandari ya pili ijengwe katika Kenya, itekelezwe. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Magugu): On a pointof order, Mr, Deputy Speaker. I would hate to interrupt the hon. Member but whathe is now saying is rather unfortunate. He is misleading the House because</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Ctd.):	nothing is being sat on.

Ni kitu gani ambacho kimefanywa mpaka sasa? </Newspeech>	<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Magugu) Mr. Deputy	 iSpeaker, I think the Motion" which the hon.

MZAMIL: Tumesikia kwamba mipango inaendelea kufanywa lakini tungetaka kujua itaendelea hivyo kwa muda gani. Tuliipitisha Hoja hiyo miaka sita au sababa iliyopita na wakati huo tuliambiwa kwamba feasibility study ilikuwa inaendelea kufanywa, na baadaye tukaambiwa kwamba tenda zilikuwa zimetolewa na kaziikapatiwa wale waliotuma maombi ya kandarasi. Sasa ni kitu gani kinachongojewa?	j	Wanasema kvamba wana : pesa na kwamba kuna nchi za kigeni ambazo ziko tayari kutupatiamikopo ya kujenga ile bandari na sioni ni kwa sababu gani tunaambiza wakati wote	jkwamba "plans are underway".

Mzamil angeitembelea ile sehemu miezi mitatu kuanzia leo ili aone kama kuna jambo lolote litakalokuwa likiendelea kule.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. MZAMIL: Basi, ikiwa watachukua hatua baada ya miezi mitatu, nitaanzakuhesabu kutoka leo mwezi wa Oktoba mpaka mwezi wa Desemba. Ikiva hakuna	'chochote ambacho kitakuv/a kimefanyika mwezi wa Desemba. nitakuja katika Bunge hili na kusema kwamba Waziri hakuweza kuitimiza ahadi ambayo alitoa hapa. Bw. Naibu . |Spika, kuna Halmashauri nyingine ya Serikali ambayo inafaa kushukuriwa na hii ni	Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation. Halmashauri hii inafanya kazi nzuri sana na nir.a haki kuishukuru sana kwa. kazi ambayo imefanva katika sehemu yangu kule Lami. Tumepatiwa simu kule Lamu mpaka sehemu za maehambani huko Faza, ambapo maraangu anapokaa. Hivyo ni kusenia nikiwa hapa ninaweza kuzungumza kwa simu kule nyumoani. Kwa hivyo, tunairhukuru Halmashauri hii kwa. kazi muhimu ambayo imetuf'anyia na t-ungewatakc waendelee na moyo huo huo.Katika upande wa barabara, ningependa kusema kwamba kazi ya kutosha haijafa nyika. Nasema hivyo kwa sababu mpaka sasa, barabara katika sehimu Mi ziko katika hali mbaya sana, hasa barabara zinazok.fenda kule kwctu Lamu. Pengine Waziri atasema lewamba mipango inaendelea kufanywa kuhusu jambo hili lakini, ningetaka kusema kwamba tulipi- tisha Hoja siku nyingi sana zilizopita hapa Sungeni kwamba barabara ya Lamu iwekwe lami, Tunashukuru shana kwa vile daraja imeanza kujengva katika sehemu fulani, lakini mipango ajnbayo inaendelea sasa inaonekana kwamba itachukuwa muda f mrefu sana na, kwa hivyo jngefaa kama waziri angeitoa kazi hiyo krfa kampuni ambayo ingeweza kuifanya kwa haraka. Nasema hivyo kwa sababu ikiwa itaendelea jinsi inavyofanywa na Wizara, ile barabara kuanzia upande wa Eola kuelekea upande wa Malindi mpaka lamu, itachukua miaka mingine 20 kukamilikav. Kwa hivyo, ili kuweza kuharakisha kazi hii, ingefaa kama Waziriangelichukua jambo hili kuwa muhimu 11a kuipatia kazi hii kampuni ambayo inaweza kuifanya kwa haraka ili sisi tuweze kuwa na. mawasiliano mazuri. kama vile imekuwa kwa upande wa posta na simu.Kwa nana upande wa magari, Waziri anastahili kupongezwa kwa bidii zake katikakazi yake. Jambo moja ambalo ningependa kumkumbusha ni kwamba makampuni mengine ya  bima fulani inayoitwa Meridian ilichukua. bima za magari ya matatu mengi hapa nchini. Viongosi wa cha matatu matatu waliwashawishiwenye magari ya matatu kuc_hukua bima katika kampuni hii na wengi wao wakafanya hivyo. Sisi sote tunafahamu hali ya magari ya matatu kufanya ajali h na hivi sasa kuna watu wengi amhao warneyapoteza maisha yao na kuna pesa karibu Shs. 2 milioni ambazo sasa zinadaiwa wenyg. matatu. Wenye matatu wengine wamepoteza pesa zao na sasa wamenyang anywa magari yao, mpaka sasa watu wanatafuta ofisi ya kampuni hii. Wao hawajui ofisi hii au meneja wa kampuni hii yuko wapi.Kwa hivyo, nina kisa ambacho ni cha kweli na ikiwa mtu yeyote anataka thibitisho niko na hati za kulithibitisha jambo hili. Kuna it gari moja la matatu ambalo lilipinduka na kumuua mtu na kesi  ikaendelea kortini na uamuzi ukawa kwamba yale mtu atalipwaShs.86,000/- na ile kampuni ya bima.

Naibu Spika, naunga Hoja hii mkono.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTER FOR FORM AFFAIRS (Mr, Kibaki): Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me these few minute? to add my words to what has already been spoken.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to urge the Ministry of Transport and Communications to regard maintenance of roads as being of equal status as build¬ing new roads. In these days of stringency in budgeting, the most painful thing in the countries in Africa is the way we are ignoring the maintenance of roads. The situation is pathetic in the whole contenent. When you have spent K£20 million building a road which you do not maintain, and you lose it sooner than you need lose it, that means too much negligence and loss of capital is much worse than anything else in any economy. What we all must do - and I think it must be taken very seriously - is to take road maintenance very seriously. I am sure that over the last two years every Kenyan has realised that we are fascinated by the construction of new beautiful roads and that the maintenance budget has become less and less. Let us build less if our budget is that small, but let us maintain what we already have because if we lose at the rate we are losing, very soon we ate shall have no roads. We shall have lost all that p capital that we have built over the last 25 years. The same thing applies to buildings and not just roads alone. We all know that if you build a beautiful home and you do not maintain it, you are going to lose it. That way, you will have lost your original capital and then you have to look for new capital. It is a straightforward matter but, unfortunately, it is not given the right status because it is not very fascinating. Could we, therefore,appeal, as representatives of these people who elect us regularly, that maintenance be given the highest priority in the next budget? </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS (ctd.):Secondly, Mr. Speaker, I would like to talk about the road designers of the Ministry of Transport and Communications. These days the radio, is telling people to preserve the soil every day. We have a duty to preserve the soil. Could we, therefore, appeal to the road designers in the Ministry of 'Transport and Communications, when they aredesigning roads, to know that they are now becoming the biggest. I was goingto use the wrong word, but they know what I mean. The way roads are designed today, even if it is down a steep ravine, the designers think of only how quickly the rain water can be drained away without caring where that water goes, ifes how much soil it carries away and the gallies it creates. That does not seem to preoccupy them. Yet, 15 to 20 years ago, the same department used to think of how to have little side vents which would reduce the amount of water so that rivers are not createdimmediately on the sides of the roads. If you look at any new road, the amount of soil being carried away tells you that soil erosion is being encouraged. This is a very small matter that can cost very little expense. It is the duty of the designers who, we hope, will think about it because, after all, as a Government department, they cannot afford to be accused of negligence in this particular regard. They can even plant grass on the sides of the roads they open up, or they can even call upon the villagers to plant grass. In order to remember to do it, could we make sure that road designers open little access roads to those villagers who live by the road?Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if you happen to have your land near the road and the road is constructed, you suddenly find that as opposed to the earlier days before the construction, you are left hanging on a cliff of about 20 feet and your house is up there and you have no manner of going there. In areas where land consolidation has taken place, you have no way of using other people's land. There is no reason why the construction of a road should make it necessary for apoor peasant farmer to spend huge sums of money to build a new access road to where he has bean left hanging up n in the air 20 feet above the ground. It is just not</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS (ctd.):reasonable. So, when they are doing the construction with their huge D.8 tractors, could they just cut little access roads to those poor men Who, through no fault of their own, have the roads passing there them? Even if you have paid compensation to the poor old man, it is not really good to leave him hanging up there. The designing of these roads can be taken care of.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are now undertaking this very huge programme called Nyayo Tea Zones. The Ministry of Transport and Communications  is involved in this programme at the district level, but one of the terrible things that is not being taken up immediately is the construction of access roads to the Nyayo Tea Zones. The planting of tea is going on now, and in two years' time from now there will be need to transport that e tea to the- factories. Even before that time comes, people have to have access to those zones. The roads to those zones cannot be left to the district development committees because they have no sources of money for that. The Ministry of Transport arid Communications, in liaison with the Ministry of Agriculture and the Kenya Tea Development Authority and everybody else involved, should now focus their minds on this problem because it is going to be upon us very soon. Two years is a very short time, within which the tea will require plucking and processing in factories. So, this is the right moment for us to address ourselves to this very iminent problem.Finally, Sir, may I appeal to the Ministry to take: into account the fact that those people who are given the responsibility of approving the work of a contractor before he is paid should know that they are carrying the responsibility of the finance of this nation. The most terrible thing today is to see roads which were built two years ago and tarmacked wearing away. For example, there is no heavy traffic in these particular roads I am talking about, such as those which which were built in the Nyeri region by a Mr. Noordin who has disappeared. There is no ks heavy traffic and there are no heavy lorries that use those roads and, therefore, we should not be told that the specifications were wrong fas because heavy</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS (ctd. ):traffic was not expected but is now moving on those roads. The size of vehicles using those roads has remained the same, but the reads have pealed open and, if you look at them, you find that there was only one inch of tarmack used on them. We have paid millions of shillings on those roads which are now murramless. Where did the millions of shillings, which we will have to pay, go? This is very serious because the money used on these roads is part of our national debt. We have ended up paying so much money for nothing just because somebody in that Ministry approved and certified the wrong work before that man was paid the money.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTHURA: It is the Chief Engineer, Roads.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. Kibaki): It is not the Chief Engineer, Roads, because he cannot be at every road site. It must be other equally qualified people who are in the field who cannot say that they did it out of ignorance. This is important matter that should be taken so seriously so that we do not give those type of contractors new contracts. Why should they be given new contracts. We used to have that kind of problem in the Ministry of Water Development but, up to now, those people who have failed to carry out proper programmes are not being given contracts. But, in this particular Ministry of Transport and Communications, people who have messed up things like that are still getting new contracts. That is very serious.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the rural access roads, or whatever name theyare given in the new language being used now, are in critical situation. Can they be restored to the status they were in some four to five years ago?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE VICE-PRESIDENT AND MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS (ctd); Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this programme was going onextremely well. But I do not know what exactly happened or who changed their minds. We, the people, were satisfied that thesetwo rural access roads should he given priority; particularly in these days when we are engaged in more intensive agricultural and horticultural development activities.. We need I these little rural access roads for every type of development Can we go on with this programme? This is "because in those little roads - and for very small sums of money - we serve the people. That j is really what matters; we open up new areas for development That is what, in every way, will matter. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would finally like to ask the Ministry of Transport and Communications to help us at the district level - in designing footpaths and foot bridges across rivers. You are never going to build enough roads. But there are very many places where people in the rural areas, who are	used to  walking. They do not have cars any way. But they have  bicy cles. There used to be footbridges and that work used to be done by the Ministry of Transport and Communications in those good old days.: They are very cheap things, The district development committees can actually finance them. Even the Harambee spirit can come in there. But we need the technical people to design those things for us. we shall use timber and we shall put a some bits of railings across them and people will then not have to walk  round long distances instead walking on foot across various places.These are the ± kind of jobs which servce hundreds of thousands of people. These services should be nearer the people. This is because people are used to walking to the markets." I beg to support, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>PROF. INDIRE: Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me an opportunity to contribute on this very important Motion and to join those hone Members who have commended the Ministry for the good work it is doing generally. I am noting also that the Ministry of Transport and Communications is one of the most important technical Ministries in our Government.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have a few points to make, and the first one is on the roads. While very much agreeing with what the hon. Vice-President and Minister for Home Affairs has said, I would like to add something on the question of re-surfacing roads. There must be more modern methods of re-surfacing roads. The kind of re-surfacing which we have recently had, and probably still going on now, between Naivasha and Nakuru seems to be a very ancient one to us road users. It may be that we are not engineers and therefore we do not know how this is done. But I am talking about this system whereby you pour huge stones on the road and leave them there for the cars to push them by the side of the road." This does not seem to a very economical way of re-surfacing the roads. I hope that what we have seen on this road will not be repeated on other roads in the country. This is because you will find that  within a day or two the roads begins melting and then you see dust and also very  pulverised stones poured on the road. What happens is simply to cause corrugations on the road. I think while we think about maintaining roads we should use more modern methods rather than this system of using very big concrete on the roads.Secondly, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we all know thatmotor accidents have become the number one killer disease this country and any steps taken by the Ministry to minimise this problem are appreciated, I am sure, by all Kenyans. But then when putting bumps on the reads I think care should be taken that not narrow and very high bumps because these spoil cars with low clearance. I think probably bigger bumps on which the car can glide a little more are better than these very, high and narrow ones which cost the car owners a lot of money in repairs.Another small point which is important is the question of speed limits. We appreciate speed limits. But I think these should be more realistic. In some cases a speed limit of 50 is put four or five kilometres from the centre of a town. I think we need to make it more progressive; from whatever speed people are using up to 100 kilometres per hour to maybe 65 K.p.h.: as you approach centres of population and then make it 50 K.p.h. when you are actually where the population is very heavy. But to put a speed limit of 50 k.p.h. five kilometres from the centre of population is not very realistic and it is bound to tempt people to break that otherwise important rule.The other point on the question of roads is that whereas we must have these  footpaths and bridges that the Vice-President and Minister for Home Affairs has talked about, there are many broken bridges in some districts. These bridges have been broken for a long time. I would urge the Ministry to monitor the activities of its people in the districts. We know that we do have provincial monitoring teams but certainly the. Ministry should be able to monitor its people because there are so many broken bridges which make communications difficult for the small farmer in the rural areas.Mr. Deputy Speaker. Sir, on the question of Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation, many hon. Members who have spoken have said that this is a corporation that needs a lot of praise from us. We commend it for what it is doing. It tells the public what they are going to be doing over the next year. So, we know about their plans." But when the Minister was speaking he did  indicate that each one of the corporations has got its own plans.We do not know anything about some of these plans a For instance we do not know anything about the Kenya Railways plans. There have been c ases where we have asked for extensions of the railway system in different parts of the country. Certainly there must be some tiling happening but we do not hear of it. We would like the same approach used like it is done by the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation who tell us what they are going to be doing over the years and we see what they are doing. I have one suggestion, however, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. While we thank the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation for having included the Maragoli Posts Office telephone exchange to the Kakamege (STD)Subseriber Trunk Dialling it would seem that the population in Hamisi, Vihiga and Emuhaya is sufficient to require a separate STD at the Maragoli telephone exchange rather than our being connected to Kakamega which is beginning to cause problems. Maragoli telephone exchange has been connected to the Kakamega STD and I think with the population in that general area we should have a separate STD based at Maragoli.</Newspeech><Newspeech>ROF. INDIRE (CTD.):Naxt is the Kenya Airways Corporation, with two small points which I think are important. One point is that the check-in area requires some seats where people who escort their relatives, friends, and so on can rest. The check-in area is there, but we need some seats placed there so that some people can use them. The other point is that I hope that the new Board of Governors will re-examine flight schedules. The Kenya flight from London, via Rome, for instance, gets to Nairobi the 3ane day that the Alitalia flight from Rome gets to Nairobi. I think this is an unwise move because the Kenyan plane which flies later would not normally have enough passengers. I think these flights need some rescheduling. Some talking and planning would be quite good. I travelled on that route quite recently and this is why I am raising that point.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there have been some Questions in this House on the management of the Kenya Ports Authority. One would hope that the	Ministry will re-examine this sort of thing. We do not want to be put in a situation where it may become necessary to call on the so-called "experts" from outside to come here and help us to man things which we can really manage ourselves. I hope that we will see reason in looking at the management ofthis Authority ourselves, thereby making any corrections if there is need forus to do that, in order to forgo the idea of bringing in expatriates to do whatwe ourselves can do.With those few remarks, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support.MR.

I would like tostart by congratulating the Minister for producing a very progressive Vote in this Budget. He has done very well, indeed, and I believe that the services, he has asked for would be fully implemented and maintained. We hope that a lot more would be done in the following year and in the other years to come.I would like to commend the Minister especially on the achievement of the telephone service. I think that this is one of the best success stories in Kenya. Wherever you go in Kenya, nearly in every district,you will find a telephone exchange and in every division you will find a telephone to ring up some place. That is something that Kenya must be proud of and we must congratulate the Minister and his team for having 2 done a wonderful service in this respect.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, when we look at our port services, we findthat they are very good. They have served our interior very well and the Minister has made sure that they maintain high standard. I do hope that they will continue to grow especially now that our commerce is increasing inter¬nally and that we will need to call more on the port services. In thisrespect, I would like to suggest that the Minister looks at it a little more to see which way improvements are required so that the planning is done now so that we are not caught at the next step of development when we need more port services than we do at the moment. This is because, at the moment, I can fore_see that our port services would soon be congested within a very short time and we may run a risk of having to lose some traffic to neighbouring ports because we cannot handle the interior.For example, as soon as Uganda gets calmer and is able to import more stuff, I believe that the Kenya Ports Authority would not be in a position to handle everything that comes in there. Since, at present, they have a very foresighted Manager  who is doing a very good job; a well learned fellow who knows very well what is going on and what is likely to happen, he should be required to put forward development proposals for the next 10 to 15 years.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (ctd):This is necessary in order that when Uganda grows up and needs more services we would be in a position to supply those services as efficiently as we have done before.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is an area to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention. I have in mind the deteriorating railways services. This country has to develop its railways services more. The management of the Kenya Railways Corporation has done what it could to boost the economy with the equipment  they it has. What it do not have is enough motive power. I think the Minister should do a little more to provide is with more motive power so that we can use the railways more often. What has happened, Sir, is that the railways are not able to take all the load that they can possibly take for various technical reasons. The result is that a lot of this load "has to go on the roads. Because the roads have to bear all that load, they break up :and we have to repair them.- In doing so we lose money.In addition, Sir, we get congestion on these roads with these very long trucks. Even if their axle load is  correct, their length alone mesmerizes a lot of drivers so that they keep looking at the wheels or get caught in the draught of the 'long vehicles and crash into them. Some¬how, you get more accidents from these long and huge vehicles andf as a result you are wasting foreign exchang earning by losing so many vehicles in accidents. This is because whatever motor-car you lose in an accident, you have lost foreign exchang. This is so because you you bought it in dollars, sterling, French francs, yens and so on. The moment you lose that car in an accident, you have lost that foreign exchange earning and, probably, it has gone beyond what you bought it for Whereas, in fact, what is carried in the trailer, could have been carried in half a bogie.I would,therefore, like to urge the Minister for Transport and Communications to do a lot more to resuscitate the railways to their fullest capacity so that there will be a tendency to reduce the density oflarge truck traffic on the roads. In this Ways, lives and foreign exchange would be saved which gets wasted, na in twisted methods. Everywhere you go, Sir, you will find twisted mangled metal all over the place. We do not have a steel mill; all that represents foreign exchange that we bought; that we spent money on and it is no longer useful to us and yet the railways are rusting for lack of frequency of runs on them. This is because we do not have enough motive -cower.Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a waste of a national asset to which we cannot close our eyes. We have to resuscitate it. The managerial capacity of the railways is there; it exists. We have engineers and capable people who can manage it. It is the equipment that they do not have. This is what this nation must sacrifice for in order to buy the equipment and to make the railways operate. In this way, the roads can be relieved of part of thisohuge load thai they have to carry and thus,wasting foreign exchange in many ways. We need this foreign exchange to even buy text books but most of it goes into twisted metal on the roadside. This is an area that the Minister should spend a lot more time looking at to see that we do not spend unnecessarily in this field. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, another area that I would like to draw theMinister's attention to is the Kenya Airways Corporation. This Corporation hasreally, three services to perform. The first and foremost, to me as a Kenyancitizen, is to see that it serves Kenya well. If I want to go to Mombasa, Eldoret, Kisii, Kisumu and so on, I will have an aircraft to take methere. This has not been developed enough. Today, it is risky to even fly toKisumu because you do not know whether the aircraft will take off. You go tothe Airport and rait to take off but you are instead told that there are technicalfaults. It is not the fault of the pilot; the pilots are good. It is not thefault of the airfield; the airfield is perfect but it is because the machinesare too old. I do remember way back in 1962 when we were in the Old Chamber and I asked that the Legislative Council approves the purchase of the first three- foker-friendships. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Contd.) :That was in 1962,Which is about 25 years ago. I know them. These aircraft are old and no matter what you do, they are bound to fail. This is what is happening now. so frequently that some of us who used to fly prefer to drive because the motor-car is more reliable to go to my Constituency in Bunyala than an aeroplane to Kisumu. This is speaking, as His Excellency the Vice-President and Ministerfor Home Affairs supports me, from experience.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, can the Minister make sure that the internal service has some new aircraft which can take us to Eldoret and back. Why is Eldoret not served? Also it should take us to Kisumu and backo It should also be able to take us to Kitale, Mombasa, Malindi, Mandera and soon. We need Kenya to be properly served so that we are one0 This is a very important service.The next area the Minister should look at in aircraft industryis that we should serve our neighbours. Of course, I know there isa problem in serving our neighbours0 This is the problem of foreignexchange in that they cannot pay us If we send passengers there, or if we book passengers, say, from Dar Es Saalan or from other places, we may not get paid. But this is an area that we should develop,. If these internal and regional services are well developed, I am sure that we will have a very, very sound base for international services. But while we concentrate on developing international services and our home service is collapsing as sometimes it does appear to me because of the number of times we have to wait at the irport hairing missed an aircraft - we will find it very, very difficult to maintain a sound international service because our domestic service is weak.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am sure the Minister is fully aware of these things, and I am also sure that he is doing everything possible to improve the services. But I believe that his colleaguesare also seeing these things and , are supporting him in his efforts</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Contd.) :to improve the services. That is all we are doing to give him support.Finally, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to say that the roads leading to certain district headquaters ought to be looked. intO. If I mention two Western Province districts - Busia and Kakamega - these have not been connected by a tarmac road0 Perhaps the Minister, in his wisdom, sooner than later, will see to it that Bisia and Kakamega are connected by a tarmac road. There is a lot more I could say on this vote,but for the moment, thank you very much. I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MWAKILEO: Ahsante sana, Bw» Naibu Spikae Tuseme kwamba wizara hii ina mambo ambayo yafaa kuzingatiwa kikamilifu kwa sababu ni "Wizara ambajro iinepewa jukuimi la sehemu kadhaa ambazo ni za kuteke- lezwa Iculingana na maisha ya binadana© Lakini utaona kwamba kati yetu sisi Wabunge kila anassimama anasema juu/ya. barabara0 Hili.^ni jambo muhimu na pia la Jewel io Lakini mimi nataka lcutoa mfano mmojao Kati lea sehemu ninayowalcilisha kuna sehemu tatu ambazo ni daraja ndogo tu na kuna kambi tatu za wafanyakazi ambaQ&ainev.ekwa hapo na wamekaa hapo zaidi ya miezi sitav, Kinachofanyika hakionekanio Hata ukijitahidi ndani ya mwezi mzima, upite pale uone lcunaendelea nini, huonio Yale mahema yako pale na nyumba zao ziko pale, lakini kinachoendelea hakionekani, na zaidi ni sicri.ti/fra Serikali inayouzwa.

Yule ambaye ni mkurugenzi au yule ambaye anasimamia sehemu hiyo yafaa apewe nafasi ya kupanua ubongo/rake na kusimamia sehemu hiyo sawasawa0 Minyinina furaha kuona kwamba maofisa wanaohusika na barabara, reli, Kenya Airways, Kenya Ports Authority, na kadhalika, wote wako hapa, na wanasikia. Kadiri ya zile ofisi nzuri walizo nazo yafaa wajue kwamba ni sisi hapa ambao huwapatiazile pesa« I-Ialafu tunasema kwamba huduma ziendelee na wafanye kazi.

Ikiwa wataendelea kufanya kazi katika hali hii, wataweza kuutumia ujuzi walio nao kikamilifu.

We do agreethat earth roads must all the time be maintained because they are not all-weatherroad.We would like the Minister to come out with a formula whereby road licences are categorized. I am saying this because there is no fairness in somebody whouses tarmac road to pay the same road licence as those people in Mbooni who use livestock-track form of roads. The Minister has been to my areas and he is awareof this. In the olden days, we had tarmac roads of only about four kilometres and the rest of the roads have never been tarmacked and they are all earth roads. I would request the Minister, although we are happy about&he maintenance unit which is maintaining these roads now and then Mr® Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do remember that the Minister, who is now sitting across in front of me, agreed in this House that several roads in my- area would be murrumed. I am surprised to note that up to now none of those roads have ever been tarmacked or bridges built® He has talked about this and although he said that the road-has been designed, up to now there is no communication through this road with some parts of Mbooni.Therefore, Sir, I would request the Minister, if not during this Financial Year, then maybe during the coming financial year, to try and give us some few tarmacked roads so that we .may also share this national -cake. One road which perhaps the Minister knows well is from Tawa to Kikima which passes through an area which is very rich in horticultural produce, milk, the latter of which is transported to the Kenya Co-operative Creameries everyday® During the rainy seasons, this road is totally .impassable® So, we would like the Minister to consider tarmacking the road from. Tawa to Kithimani." joining the Thilca Road. That road Makutano-Mwala-Kabaa-Kithimani is a very busy^oad and after every three minutes a vehicle passes through ito We pay for road licences and I an sure the meaning of a road licence is to make the person who uses that road to pay for its use® If that is the actual meaning of a road licence, then the Minister will have to give the licences in our area a different name. This is because some parts of my area do not have any roads at alio So, why should they force people there to have that small&heet of paper called "a road licence"? Let them be called ,!track licences" or "livestock-route- licences" .Mr. 2 Deputy Speaker Sir, while speaking about the areas I havereferred to, I would also like to remind the Minister what his AssistantMinister promised this House before we broke off for recess in July, that Wasnunyu market would be tarmacked. It is a high time that this was done andas he said that this is a time for getting the finances, I would like to remindhim that this is a very small area to be tarmacked. The Minister himself hasbeen there and he saw the place. Every work has been completed, that is mapping and budgeting of the work. However, it was aid that this work would bedone before the end of the year and I would be very happy if it would be done. I would also like to remind the Minister that the potholes that I was talkingabout before we went on recess are still there and some of them are three feetwide near yathiu  Market and in some other areas. These potholes have notyet been filled up to this moment. I do not know how the Assistant Ministergave, out his directives. PerhaPs when he issued	directives somethingwent wrong because nobody ever took care of them I would like to congratulethe Minister, particularly for the good work that  his officers havebeen rendering us with postal services. I am saying this because we havetelephone services all over the place as my friends have been saying, and we can now communicate in every part of Kenya. The Minister promised that we were goingto have a post Office at  Kalava before the end of the year. It is true thatthis is going to happen because now they have put up posts and so on ana weare sure that we are going to have a telephone exchange there. However, I wouldlike the Minister to consider giving us a full post office at Kalawa Marketbecause this area is very far from the major towns and commercial banks are not available there.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MS. MUNTYAO (ctd.):There are farmers there who would like to bank their money in a post office and there are also teachers who would like to save the money they pay in form of bus fare coming to Machakos. The area is big and has beautiful buildings and, if the Minister could consider providing full postal services, the wananchi would really be very  happy with him.The other thing that I would like to draw the attention of the Minister to is that in some of the towns where telephone extensions have been opened up. very few of them have telephone booths. I would like to inform the Minister that just supplying telephone services to individuals is not enough. You only serve the whole population when you install a few telephone booths so that whoever wants to make a call can uo it. There are a few markets where telephone services have been provided but there are no telephone booths for public use.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would new like to turn to railway' services which are also rendered by the Ministry. We would like to appeal to the Minister to think of joining Konza and Machakos by railway line and go up to Kitui. Kachakos Town has now become more industrialised than it was every before. There are several millers there and we would like the sugar and other foodstuffs which are transported by road to be transported by railway line. A lot of people have hired vehicles from Ebooni and other areas just to come and see a train along Konza or Athi River Railway line. We want to appeal to the Minister that he should have a plan to have a railway line serving Machakos town.Sir, I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the President for appointing a new board to Kenya Airways. Kenya Airways is one of the best airlines we have ever seen before, but we need to promote it even more so that when the aircraft is travelling, it may be doing so in full capacity. The Minister and his officers need to appeal to the foreimers in this country, mostly Asians, to travel Kenya Airways. It is so surprising that when you go to the Jomo Kenyatta International, Airport you find Asians que using at the British  Airways terminal. You would</Newspeech><Newspeech>MB. MUNXAO (ctd,): think "there is an exodus of Asians from Kenya. Why can those Six Asians not travelKenya Airways? We need to promote cur airline much more than we are doing now. I am very happy that one of our diplomats has been appointed to head this organisation, and I am sure that enough promotion is going to be done. Also, I am happy that hon.Gecaga, who has never identified himself with any failure, was  appointed to chair the board of directors. With that kind of chairman and the managing director and other few board members, I am sure that the airline will make a headway. We need the airline promoted because it is one of the best airlines which flies around here and it would be reliable.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would hate to repeat what one of the Ministers here siad, that the aircraft owned by Kenya Airways is old. That is not a language to be vised, in this is public forum because we should campaign for the airline in order for it to operate fully. If one starts to say that the aircraft is old, he will be scaring potential customers. We should be proud of whatever aircraft the airline owns although we know they are very few and aged. Being aged does not mean that the aircraft is unserviceable; it is totally serviceable and it is better than the aircraft owned by any other airlines around. I would appeal that the members of Kenya Airways staff do continue to maintain the present standard.</Newspeech><Header> ADJOUERMEHT </Header> <Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Order! Hon.

The five police officers temporarily accommo¬dated at the Ministry of Transport and Communications camp at Kola are just thore for regular patrol duties in the area. Kola area falls under the Kilome Police Station which is quite a distance away. In view of this long distance, it was found necessary to organise regular police patrols at Kola and the surrounding areas. In view of the nature of their duties, the Government has not found it necessary to put up living quarters for these police officers. However, subject to a recommendation by the District Development Committee, (DDC), and the availability of fund, the Government may consider in future putting up a police post at Kola.Mr. Speaker, may I also add that due to the nature of the duties of these officers, having to patrol and move regularly from one particular area to another, then, of course, they have to live in temporary structures to enable them to perform their duties well.</Newspeech>Question No. 518MR.

The complaint was thoroughly investigated and. it was found that there was no evidence to show that the complainant was physically assaulted by anybody and consequently, the matter was closed. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. OMIDO:  Mr. Speaker, I am surprised that the Minister says that the Commissioner of Police did not receive this complaint. This is because, I wrote a letter to him requesting him to look into this complaint after the complainant had approached me. The Commissioner of Police wrote back to me and said that the matter was being looked into. How come now that he did not receive the complaint? Who investigated the incident; is it the same officers who were suspected or was the investigation carried out by different officers? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ole TIPISs Mr. Speaker, what actually happened, for the information of my friend was this; On 7th August, 1985, Mr. Samuel Mwangi Njogu of P.O. Box 17056, Nairobi, and a resident of Bahati Estate, House No. 1674, reported at Jogoo Police Station that he had been assaulted by police officers in his house on the 4th August, 1985 at about 9.30 p0m. He was issued with a P3 Form	!and an enquiry file was opened on the matter. The complaint was thoroughly investigated, including recording statements from 16witnesses and the complainant was medically examined, but it was found that there was no evidence to show that he had been physically assaulted by anybody.

Are they still functioning or have they just disappeared into thin air? These matters should be speeded up. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTURIA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the district commissioners in question are doing their jobs as assigned. They have not disappeared. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon.

He has told us that the district commissioner is a very busy man, and that made me think of the other provision that was made to the effect that some district commissioners who had retired formerly were going to listen to land cases. What happened to them? Why do they not take up these cases, rather than wait for a Presidential Commission? That is what I am asking. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTURIA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the district commissioners who have retired, as hon. Shikuku says, are not very many; they are very few.

Could the Assistant Minister assure this House that one such special district commissioner is going to be sent to Embu to complete the hearing of these appeal cases as soon as possible? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTURIA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, that can be considered. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon.

Withonly one consideration in mind, we would like to know when action will be taken in this respect. Can the Assistant Minister assure us that one of these special district commissioners will be posted to Embu to listen to these cases? The wananchi there are waiting for action. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTURIA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I said earlier on, these are only 16 cases. In fact, the District Commissioner, Embu, has not suggested that he cannot handle them. So, the hon.

KIKUYU asked the Minister for Transport and Communications:-(a)when the Ministry will put guard rails on Mwania Bridge on the Machakos -Katumani Road; and(b)whether he could consider raising the level of the bridge and re-surrey the road to avoid the sharp corners near the bridge.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Keriri): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(a)The installation of guard rails on Mwania Bridge on the Machakos- Katumani Road is on hand, and is expected to be ready by the third week of October, 1987.(b)The bridge does not require raising, but it requires a major improvement by widening it. The work of re-surveying and aligning the road requires a substantial sum of money, and the Ministry does not have such funds at the moment. However, adequate warning signs for sharp bends and the narrow bridge will be placed at appropriate distances so that motorists can approach</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Keriri)(Ctd.):and cross the bridge safely, </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIKUYU: MR. Speaker, Sir, I brought up part (a) of this Question because the Question was here last year, and the Assistant Minister answered it in the same way he has done now. Could he assure us now that the work therehas truly commenced and that it will be completed? Most buses travelling on that route fall into the river at that juncture. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KERIRI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to give that assurance. Incidentally, I would like to solicit some assistance from the hon. Member. Could he tell us whether he has been there of late and whether the work has commence or not? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIKUYU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, to answer the Assistant Minister's question. I was there last Sunday coming from a Harambee funds drive in Kimutw’a Sub-Location, and I saw that no work had commenced. Unless this work was started either last Monday or yesterday, it has not yet commenced. </Newspeech><Header> Question No. 535 </Header> MR. P.T. MUNGAI asked the Minister for Water Development when the work on the second.phase of Komothai Water Project, Gatamaiyu Location in Lari Division will commence.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR WATER DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Kiptanui): Mr. Speaker Sir, I beg to reply.Work on the second phase of Komothai Water Project, Gatamaiyu Location in Lari Division will commence when funds are made available for construction of the project. Up  to this Financial Year, no money has been allocated for this project.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.T. MUNGAI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the Assistant Minister why no money has been allocated to this project this Financial Year? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIPTANU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is because of the ceiling  given to the Ministry of Water Development that we were not able to finance this Mathira project which  is now in its second phase as said earlier on. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. P.T. MUNGAI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to draw the attention of the Assistant Minister to the fact that, phase I; of this project is already complete and has served only a few people. The majority of people have not been served by this project and I am wondering whether the Assistant Minister can speed up this work so that this majority of people can make use of this project. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIPTANUI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, knowing the area and the already constructed phase and the one in question with an amount of Sh.l6.6 million, we are not at this time able to further fund this project until much later in the year.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUIA, on behalf of Mr. Munyao, asked the Minister for Water Development :-(a)whether he is aware that Mbumbuni water Project has developed a serious problem and that Kitondo Secondary School has not been getting regular water supply; and(b)whether he will take urgent steps to rectify this problem.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR WATER DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Kiptanui):Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(a) Yes, the Minister is aware that Mbumbuni Water Project has developed a problem, and that Kitondo Secondary School has not been getting regular water supply. This is because the self-help group has over-burdened the project by extending supply beyond the design area. This means that the supply originally designed for Mbumbuni and Kitondo Secondary School is now serving additional areas and so naturally, it has become inadequate. Further,the old pump has been over-burdened.(b.) In the circumstances, the Ministry has bought a new pumping set which was installed on Friday, 25th September, 1987 and is now operational. The situation has therefore improved. However, the Ministry will continue to ration the available water as it is not adequate for everybody. The Ministry will also increase the hours of pumping for the line leading to Kitondo Secondary School, in order to improve the school's water supply. However, in the circumstances, the Board of Directors of the school would be well advised to consider constructing roof catchment to harvest rain water as an additional source during the problematic periods.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUIA: While thanking the Assistant Minister for that reply, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the information I have from the hon. Member for that area is that it is not only this particular school, but there is also another school called KiSau Girls Secondary School with 500 students and Nduluku Village Polytechni with about 200 students. The new machine which the Assistant Minister is talking about which was installed is not pumping enough water to these three institutions including Kitondo Secondary School. So, when is the Assistant Minister going to ensure that these three institutions plus the market place get sufficient water from the new pumping machine?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIPTANUI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while I appreciate the problem of the two institutions he has mentioned, in addition to this one in question, I said earlier on that this water project was designed to cater for some areas but it was extended to other areas and so the water does not reach these extended are We will do what we possibly can to alleviate the problem. Since we have installed a new sat pumping set in addition to the old one, the pumping hours to these schools will be increased so that the capacity of water from this self-help project will serve the institutions mentioned. But, I still maintain the fact that the water source is not having enough water for these areas which need water.</Newspeech><Header> Question NQ.545 </Header> MR. GALGALLO, on behalf of Mr. Boru, asked the Minister for Water Development:-(a)how many dams were constructed by the Dam Construction Unit in Marsabit North Constituency from 1983 to 1986; and(b)when he will construct dams at Hurri Hills, Laga Balal and Dida Galgalu as recommended by the District Development Committee.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR WATER DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Kiptanui): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(a)There were no dams constructed by the Dam Construction Unit in Marsabit North Constituency from 1983 to 1986 because the Unit was busy doing similar work in other equally dry areas of Wajir, Isiolo Garissa and Mandera Districts.(b)It is expected that the Dam Construction Unit will move to Marsabit North Constituency in three months time to construct dams at Hurri Hills, Laga Balal and Dida Galgalu as recommended by the District Development Committee.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. GALGALLG: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while appreciating the Assistant Minister's answer, can he tell the House why this unit was concentrated only in one province whereas there are other districts in this Republic which are suffering from lack of water and they need this Dam Construction Unit?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIPTANUI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we wish that the Ministry has 41 dam construction units to cater for every district. Since we do not have that number, we have to share and that is why we had to move this Dam Construction Unit. Logically, and considering the distances, when the Dam Construction Unit is moved from a far distance it also costs a lot of money when these machines are moved. So, we would rather concentrate on one area for a given period and then we move to another area. Now, we have plans to move to this ares to construct pumps and dams in Marsabit North Constituency where we willConstruct two new dams; and then move to Isiolo and construct three pumps, and so on. </Newspeech><Header> Question N0.429 </Header> MR. arap KOSKE asked the Attorney-General(a)whether he is aware that Mr. Elijah K.A. Cheruiyot was sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment by the Resident Magistrate, Kericho incriminal case N0.2385 of 1983;(b)whether he is further aware that Mr. Cheruiyot served six months in jail and on criminal appeal No.280, of 19845 Nakuru, he was acquitted ; and the sentence set aside; and(c)what action he is taking to ensure that the complainant is compensated for the period he was in jail.<Newspeech>THE ATTOHNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.In reply to parts (a) and (b) of the Question I would like to say that I am aware except that the appeal was allowed and the accused was discharged but not acquitted as the hon. Member says in part (b) of his Question.However as regards part (c) of the Question, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have this to say; As the law stands now, and having the greater public policy in mind, there is no and there should be no, resort to successful appellants in criminal cases moving against the State for compensation for the period they might have been in prison or in custody. This is so on the principle that a person is on conviction is presumed to have committed the offence as opposed to before conviction where the presumption of innocence is held.So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the question of the complainant being compensated for the period he was in custody or in jail does not arise.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Mr. Ddaiddo." </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DDAIDDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, following the reply given by the Attorney-General and if I heard him properly on part (c) of the Question, he spoke of “greater public policy". He did not quote any section of our laws. Can he prove, to this House that there is a law which states categorically that a person who moves against the State for compensation cannot be paid compensation? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MULI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I said that there is no law that provides for compensation for the period that a person has been in custody. As to whether there is any specific law which bars anybody from going to court to ask for that compensation, I am not aware of it. But the success of his application for compensation may be in e jeopardy.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. BOMETT: Mr. Speaker, Sir, since it is very apparent and also very clear that this law as it stands now is unfair and since it is very unfair when a person is jailed and when he appeals and is acquitted is not compensated, would the Attorney-General consider bringing a law to this House that when a man appeals he can be compensated adequately? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MULI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us start from the beginning. When a person has been held in custody pending trial he is presumed to be innocent and he is supposed to be brought to court as soon as possible. On conviction the balance reverses; he is no longer unlawfully held. He is now in custody e lawfully having been convicted; he is a convicted person. If he appeals against this conviction and the conviction is set aside on upholding his appeal, during those periods the person cannot now claim to have been unlawfully detained. Therefore, he cannot claim for compensation.As to the propriety of bringing a law to pay compensa¬tion, I have answered here  before and said that I do not think that at the moment it is opportune, in public interest, that such a law should be brought</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: Arising from that reply, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and which I consider a sad one I say this because I have tasted prison life. Would the Attorney-General consider the views of hon. Members who are the spokesmen of the people, that if there is no law time has come when he should bring a law here whereby if you are acquitted or you are wrongly confined. The other day I gave an example of a person who served 15 years out of a term of20 years with strokes. This man was acquitted after serving 15 years out of a prison term of 20 years with strokes. Would the Attorney-General consider the views of this House and bring a law to this House? I am not asking him to do so on his own accord or feelings but on demand of the people's representatives. Would he consider bringing a law here to provide for that?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MULI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not talking about my own feelings as the hon. Member for Butere is trying to imply. The public interest does not demand or rather persuade me at the moment that a person who has been held on a very serious charge and has been convicted and on appeal he is realesed on a technicality, compe¬nsation should be paid.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Attorney-General should not talk about technicalities. We are talking about acquittal and sentences being set aside. When he talks of public interest, does he consider the views of this House? Where is this public interest? Is it not represented in this House? Since we the spokesmen of this public interest are saying so, why does the Attorney-General not get persuaded? We are the spokesmen of the people. We have been elected to this House by the people</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MULI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not think the hon. Member has got the concensus of this House yet. He is just expressing his own opinion. However, matters of this nature need to be considered. I will be quite happy to consider this matter if the hon. Member would write me a memorandum showing the balance of propabilities to warrant otherwise. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

Hawa wafanyakazi wanne waliaehishwa kazi mnamo tarehe 6.3.87 baada ya wao kukataa kutii amri iliyowataka wapakue mizigo katoka kwa gari wakati walipokuwa kazini." Hawa wafanyakazi waliyapeleka malalamiko yao leva Ofisa wa Leba kule Voi mnamo tarehe 23.3.87 na baada ya mkutano baina yao na muajri wao Ofisa Ixuyo wa Leba aliamua walipwe mshahara wa notisi ya mwezi mmoja kila mmoja wao na pia s pesa za  siku walizokuwa wamefanya kazi pamoja na pesa za likizo. Kwa jumla malipo hayo yote yalikuwa KShs.3,177.70 na muajiri alizilipa pesa hizi kwa ofisi ya leba huko Yoi mnamo tarehe Lakini wafanyakazi hao walikataa kuzichukua pesa hizo, hadi sasa, kwa sababu walifikiri lewamba matakwa fences ii yao hayakutimizwa.	Bw.  Spika, uchunguzi uliofanywa na Ofisa wa Leba kule Yoi baada ya Swali hili kuletwa Bungeni umethibitisha kwamba muajiri huyo hajawahi kuwany anyasa wafanyakazi hawa kwanjia yo yote. Kwa mfano muajiri huyo alikuwa wakiwalipa wafanyakazi wake mshahara wa KShs.680/- kila mwezi kwa kila mfanyakazi ijapokuwa mshahara wa chini kulingana na sheria iliyoko,</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. Obure) (ctd);huko Voi ni KShs.372/- kvva mvvesi.Euhusu sehemu ya (c) ya Swali hlli, ningependa ku.semakwamba hakuna adhabu yo yote atakayopev/a muajiri Iruyo kvva sababu yeye bado  hajavurga sheria.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

Ofisa wa wafanyakazi wa Voi, au wa Butere au wa mahali popote ,nina kesi nyingi i kama hizo anaweza kupatana na yule mwajiri na akose kutiiniza wajibu wake. Uchunguzi huu ulif anywa na mtu gani?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OBURE: Bw. Spika uchunguzi huu ulifanywa na Ofisa wa Wafanyakazi Voi Mpaka sasa tuna imani naye kwa sababu yeye ni mfanyakazi wa Serikali ambaye tunatengeniea akituakilisha katika sehemu hiyo Mhe Mbunge aliyeuliza Swali hili ametaja mambo ya Icunyanj asa wafanyakazi, lakini hajaeleza ni kwa njia gani wafanyakazi wananyanyaswa. Sisi kama Wizara tutachukuxva hatua mara moja ilciwa anaweza Icudhibitisha kwamba wafanyakazi wanayanyaswa kwa njia nyingine yeyote.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: Bw. Spika, kufuatana na hilo jibu kunyanyasxfa kwa hawa wafanyakazi Icunaonekana kafeis katika barua iliyoandikiwa kx Katibu Mkuu tarehe 17.10.1986. Katika barua hiyo walieleza wazi taabu wanazopata kutoka kwa mwajiri huyu, na isitoshe, alipowafuta kazi, hakuwalipa pesa zozote kwa kufanya kazi ile mweziambaye amekubali kuwalipa. Pi hakuwapatia notisi ya mwezi mojakab ya kuwafuta lcazi. Barua ya mwajiri ambayo nilco naya hapa inaeleza  kwamba sasa amekubali kuwalipa. Bw.

If you do not come to collect your five days dues, then we will consider the same as .payment for is loans".Bw. Spika, hapa hasemi chochote kuhusu ule mshahara wa mwezi moja ambao hulipwa badala ya kutoa notisi ya mwezi moja. Sasa Waziri Msaidizi anasema jambo hilo. Yeye alikuwa anawanyanyasa kwa kuwafuta kazi na kuwaambia kwamba hawatapata chochote uosg mpaka wakati Wizara ilipoingilia jambo hili Huku ndio kuwanyanyasa kama mhe. Mwachofi alivyosema.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OBURE: Bw. Spika, sasa nimeelewa mhe. Shikuku. alikuwa akisema nini juu ya kunyanyaswa.

Tuliposikia kwamba wafanyakazi wanne wamefukuzwa kr, £ kazi bila kupewa hati yao sisi kama Wizara tuliliingilia jambo hilo, tukafanya uchunguzi na tukaita mkutano wa mwajiri na hawa wafanyakazi na baadaye tukaamua kwamba huyu mwajiri awalipe hawa wafanyakazi in lieu of notice.

MICHOMA: Ahsante sana, Bw. Spika, kwa lcunipatia fursa hii ili nami nijiunge na Waheshiraiwa Wabunge wenzangu. katika kuiunga mkono Ho ja hii ya Wizara ya Uchukuzi na Mawasiliano. Kwanza kabisa, nataka kuishukuru Wizara hii kwa yote iliyotimiza. Kwa mfano, nataka kumshiikuru Mtukufu Rais kwa kuliokoa shirika letu la ndege ambalo lilikuwa linafifia. Pia, namshukuru kwa km leumteua mhe. (Dkt.) Gecaga, aiabaye ana ujuzi mwingi, kuwa mwenyekiti wa shirika hilo la ndege pamoja na Bw. Joe Kyaga kuwa mkurugenzi mkuu wa shirika hilo. Ninawajua watu hawa wawilina nina hakika kwamba watalifufua shirika letu la ndege tunalolitegemea sana. Idle tunacho takikana kufanya ni ku kuwaunga watu hao wawili mkono kwa dhati na tukiona kosa fular tuwashauri ili shirika hilo liweze kuendelea vyema. Wale tunaosafiri tunajua kwamba ndege zetu, hasa zile za zamani, zinachelewa na tunatuin&ini kwamba wakurugenzi walioteulivra watalitatua tatizo hilo.Bw. Spika, nataka pia kulishukuru Shirika la Reli la Kenya, linaloongozwa na Mkurugenzi Mkuu, Bw. Kimano, ambaye ajuetekeleza kazi nzuri sana. Ingawa hivyo, nataka kuseraa kwamba tangu tujinyakulie Fnuru, Serikali haijajenga reli mpya ingawa Hoja nyingi za kufanya hivyo simepitishwa katika Bunge hili. Kwa mfano, njia yareli itokayo Kidawa. kupitia Kerxcho, Kisii had.i Tariine ni ya maana mno kwa sababukuna raazao rnengi katika sehemu hizo yanayohitaji kusafirishwa. Jambo lingine arabalo nataka kuishukuxu Wizara hii Kwalo hasa upande wa KenyaPorts Authority, ni li]e k la kujenga Inland Container Depot hapa Nairobi ambapohalmashauri nyingi za Serikali zimepata ploti pamoja na Halmashauri ya Kahawa Nchini, ambako tunawez a kujenga raaghala ili kurahisisha usafirishaji wa mazao.Nikigusia ,p upande wa barabara, nataka lcusema kwamba ingawa Wizara yaUchukusi na Mawasiliario imejaribu inavyoweza, "barabara nyingine zimekuwa hazipitild.ITinaishukuru Serikali kwa kukubali kuiweka lami barabara itokayo Kisii hadi Kebirigo, ha Chemoset. Sasa itakuwa rahisi kwa wale vanaoishi Kisii na Nyanza Kusinl kusafiri kuja Nairobi. Pia, kunayo barabara nyingine itokayc Sotik kupitia Narok kuja Nairobi ambayo ni ya muhimu na inayostahili kuvrekwa lami. Kuna barabara nyingine nyingi ambazo ningeweza kutaia, kama ile itokayo Kamagambo kupitia Exago, Mugunga, Nyangusu, Gesusu, Masimba, Keroka, Mussk Mochenwa kupitia Matogo na Kagwagwa. Eiyo ni barabara ambayo itakuwa imeungan'isha mawasiliano ya Wilaya rabili za Kisii na Nyamira. Nataka pia kusisitiza limuhimu wa barabara za kahawa pamoja na njia ya reli itokayo Meru hadi Nanyuki. Barabara za kahawa zimekuwa mbaya. Rural access roads ndizo tu ambazo zimeiokoa nchi hii, na tunaitaka Wizara ya Uchukuzi na Mawasiliano izitilie maanani sana na kuwa na vikundi kadha wa kadha za kuzireke- bisha barabara hizi katika kila vilaya. Tunamshukuru Mtukufu Rais pia kwa kusema kwamba maendeleo yarudishwe wilayani mahali wananchi wengi wanakokaa, lakini tatizo moja ainbalo linawakabili wanancki huwa ni kutopitika kwa barabara wakati wa mvua, hasa katika pande za Kisii na Meru na sehemu nyingine nyingi za Kenya ambako kunalimwa kahawa. Ilakuna barabara nzuri zina.zoweza kutumiwa kusafirisha kahawa kutoka viwaiidani badi Nairobi.Bw. Spika, Serikali inapata lcodi kubwa sana kutokana na mauzo ya kahawa, na wakulima Kxk waraekuwa vakilia kwamba export duty ipunguswe kwa sababu imelcuwa razigo mzH razito sana kwao. Tunashukuru kwamba cess inayotozwa kahawa na serikali za vilaya imepunguzwa kutoka asilimia tatu hadi asilimia moja, lakini wakulimawanastahili kutiwa moyo ikiwa tunataka kuitekeleza hati ya Serikali Narobari Moja ya 1986 iliycpitishwa r.a. Bunge hili Wakulima wa kahawa wajiafaa kusaid.i.wa pia kwa sababu sasa iunasikia kwamba bei ya rabolea imepanda juu. WaJculima wa kahawa pia wanataka kusaidiwa kwa kutengenezewa barabara safi, nguvu za uracme ili kahawa iweze kusagwa wakati wa usiku, simu na vifaa vingine vingi. Yafaa barabara za kahawa ziwe zinapitika usiku na mchana na pia wakati wa mvua. Si haki Serikali kuendelea kutoza eutz faida inayopatikana kutokana na kahawa kodi zaidi lava sababu jarabo hilo limewavunja raoyo waiculima wa kahawa. Hadi sasa, wakulima wan ad ai pesa nyingi sana na Serikali ingawa Waziri wa Fedha aliposoma Bajeti grUrxyEft alisema kwamba madeni yangepunguswa. Hata Halmashauri ya Kahawa inapokopa pesa kutoka benki kuwalipa wakulima, ni lazima kwanza tulipe Hazina ya Serikali ndipo baadaye tuwalipe wakuliraa. Je hii ni njia ya kuwatia wakulima wa kahawa raoyo? llafikiri Waziri wa Fedhaj akishirikiana na. Waziri wa Uchukuzi na Mawasili?cno, anapaswa kuweka juhudi zaidi kuwasaidia wakulima ili waweze kuongeza zao la kahawa linaloipatia nchi hii pesa nyingi za kigeni. Ingawa ±nm tumelisema jambo hili mara kwa raara na wakulima wameililia Serikali bila hatua yoyote kuchukuliwa, nafikiri lingekuwa jarabo bora sana lcutekelezwa kwa sababu Serikali imesema kwamba kufikia mwaka wa 2,000 tutakuwa tumeongeza mazao mara tatu. Je hii ndiyo njia moja ya kuongeza mazao ikiwa tuna watoza wakulima kodi kubwa kabla ya kuwalipa na pia bila kuwatengenezea barabara? Kvra wakati huu, mabaraza ya^kono&M mengi hayatengenezi barabara licha ya kuwatoza wakulima kodi inayoitwa cess. Hata wakulima wangependelea sana ikiwa, ile sehemu ya asilimia moja ingeondolewa na waulizwe wenyewe kujitengenezea barabara hata ikiwa watalazimika kulcodisha inatrakta, badala ku kodi leubwa. Wizara yaFedha pamoja na ile ya Uchukuzi na Mawasiliano, na Serikali kvra jumla, hazijawahi kuitikia ombi la wakulima.	Jambo lingine ambalo ningetaka kusema ni kwamba viwanja vya ndege kokote nchini, hasa kule Homa Bay, Kisii na kwingineko, ingefaa vifanuliwe ili watu waweze kusafiri bila matatizo. Hii ndege inayoitwa Porker Friendship imekuwa kama matatu, na ukisafiri nayo unasikia kama unasafiri kwa trekta. Kwa hivyaprafaa iondolewe pesa zikipatikana na nyingine inunuliwe. Pia ingefaa Serikali inunuo ndege nyingine ndogo ndogo ili zipate kwenda popote ambapo wananchi wangependa kufika.Jambao langu la mwisho, Bw. Spika, ni kumwomba Waziri iia rtfa^iia hii sjphunguze barabara inayotoka hapa Nairobi kwenda Limuru. Ukifika karibu na Limuru wakati wa usilcu unakutana na magari makubwa makubwa.Kwa hayo machache, ninaunga rakono.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. arap BOMETT: Thank you very, very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I also rise to contribute on this very important Vote and Ministry. It is important because communication is a means around which all other Ministries do revolve. We cannot have hospitals and schools without good roads I think this Ministry is a very, very vital Ministry.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like first of all to say a few things that I feel the Ministry has achieved. One of them is on making of roads. Nakuru District, there is a project known as German Regravelling Unit. This unit has done a very good job. I think the Ministry should emulate that group of people who are working in that unit should have our own kenyans operating a regravelling unit. Indeed, we used to have ones I remember that when I was in that Ministry many years back, we used to have a regravelling unit which was very well equipped and which was doing a very good job. So, I would like to thank the Ministry for regravelling of the road from Bahati to the border of Nakuru and Baringo at Kisanana. I would also like to thank the Ministry for similar work which was done between Rongai and the Visoi area.Having said that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to say that tarmacking of roads in Kenya leaves a lot to be desired. I do not know whether it is a mistake of the international contractors, or whether it is a mistake of our engineers. I amsaying this because the loads that are made do not last at all. For example, the road between Kisumu and Nakuru has been done several times but after every three years you find people going back to patch up the same road. Who is making this mistake? Is it that we do not have engineers to supervise the construction of these roads and make sure that they are built according to international standards? We have got one road which was built by the Italians between Nakuru and Nairobi. Although this road is almost worn out, it is still very strong. I challenge our young indigenous engineers to be patriotic and. construct good roads.It is a shame, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we borrow a lot of money from the World Bank, or we go begging in the world and when the money comes here, maybe  I do not say “yes"  a few fellows get cuts here and there. They get beautiful cars. What do we get in turn? We get second-hand roads, which do not last. Our roads should last, say, 50 years before they are repaired.Now, having said that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to say something about the railway. I am glad that the Mover, the hon. Minister, did say something about the railways. He said that there will be an additional railwayline. But I laugh, and I have seen a lot of people in the countryside laugh as well. At the moment, what the railway does is only to have passenger train between Mombasa and Nairobi, and one train at night to take our Nyansa friends between Nairobi, Kisuntu and Butere. But the normal carriage of goods is almost non-existent. I challenge anybody to tell me how many wagons move nowadays between Mombasa and Malaba? Almost all the wheat is being ferried through our road system. This is why we have a lot of accidents because lorries that are not meant to be on our roads are there. So, we have to do something about the railway. The Ministry of Transport and Communications must make sure that the railway committee or board produces results because as it is now it is almost "dead". It is "dead”. We must speak the truth. If you say "no", let us prove it. I ask you to give us figures and facts. How many bags of maize have been taken from Kitale to Nairobi by the railway? Give us the number. Prove it.Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have got wagons which are lying there refrigerated wagons which used to take milk from. Kitale, Eldoret and Nakuru to Nairobi. Are they moving the milk now? No I Only private huge trucks which travel on that road. We do not need them. We needthe refrigerated trucks to go to the Kenya Co-operative Creameries (K.C.C.) Nakuru and take the milk to Nairobio At the moment, you will find that the farmers are crying. Milk is kept in depots. It is not being carried because there are not enough trucks to carry it.  why? Because individual transporters do not have enough money to spend. Yet we have public money. If you go to the railway yard you will find that there are so many trucks.Mr. Speaker Sir, when I read the papers today, I almost cried when read what the Minister said that we do not have the rolling stock. We have the rolling stock. In fact 20 wagons are lying in the yard. What.:, are they doing there? Theyiire just lying simply because we do not plan. They are also lying there because diesel is being stolen. We must speak the truth. People are not patriotic. They are not serving the country properly. I think the railway has failed us and it is time they are told to  “wake up". The Kenya Railways and also the Kenya Meat Commission and so on are not giving us results. Every year we come here, pass money, and then people just go back and say, "How much did we get this year? Gentlemen, let us sit together and share this money".  This is public money and we are here to give the money, but the money must be spent on public utility.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to talk about air transport and freighting of our horticultural produce to Europe. We are cutting ourselves out of the European market. The farmers of Kenya are growing a lot of horticultural produce. Avocado for example. We cannot sell our avocado now and we cannot also sell pineapples. Why? Because the price of  the  freight is shooting up every year. Who  is benefiting? It is the foreign agent. Who is giving them permission to increase the air¬freight? It is our own people. For example, now it costs KSh.46/- to take one carton of vegetables to European market. As a result, West Africa is getting the market. Even Countries south of us, likeSouth Africa or Zimbabwe, are getting the horticultural market. I appeal to the Minister to see to it that before they increase the price for the freight of horticultural produce,we should be very careful because we are hurting our own farmers. We are hurting our own people. The produce will cost more and when it reaches the European market, we are unable to compete with those that are sub¬-sidised. So, I appeal to this Ministry which is so important to support us and the country, and be patriotic. I support the Vote.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS AND SETTLEMENT (Mr. Miituria) : Ahsante sana, Bw. Spika, kwa kunipatia nafasi hii ili nami niseme machache kuhusu Wizara hii ya Uchukuzi na Mawasiliano.ICwanza kabisa, ningetaka lashtrkmrt Waziri wa Wizara hii pamoja na wafanyakazi wake wote kuanzia Katibu wa Kudninu kupitia kwa wakurugenzi wa ziko chini ya Wizara hii ambayo ni ya muhxara sana katika nchi hii yetu ya Kenya. Watu wengi katika nchi hii jui ni kazi gani ambayo inafanywa na Wizara hii. Wizara hii ina fanya kazi ya inuhimu sana katika nchi hii na inatunikia wananchi kwa njia nzuri sana kila mahali ambapo Wizara hii inahusika.Kwanza, Wizar inahusika na barabara Pili wanayo relio Halafu wanayo Kenya Ports Authority. Pia, wanayo Kenya Airways. Tena wanayo Kenya Posts and Telecommunications. Pia, wanalo shirika la leutoa leseni za magari. Tena wanalo shirika ambalo linahusika na ndege na pia shirika ambalo linahusika na hali ya anga. Kwa hivyo, ukiangalia utaona kwamba ukiilinganisha Kenya na zile nchi nyingine za bara Afrika utaona kuna tofauti kubwa sana. Mimi nimewahi kutembea katika bara Afrika. Utaona kwamba huwezi kulinganishai barabara za Kenya na za nchi nyingine yoyote katika bara la Afrika.Bw. Spika, tunaitolea Wizara hii shukrani nyingi sana ijapo kuwa bado hawajaimaliza kazi yote. Lakini yafaa tufahamu kwamba</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS AND SETTLEMENT (Mr. Mituria)(Contd.): Roma haikujengwa kwa siku moja. Wanaenda mbele kila nrwezio Kila mwalca Jaxna kitu ambacho lcinaendelea Jcuhusu barabara zetu za Kenya.Bw. Spika, ukiangalia upande wa reli, utaona kwamba nchi hii inahudumiwa na reli ambayo inatoka Soinbasa mpaka Uganda, ijapo kuwa hawana shukranio Ufcaona kwamba hawa watu wa reli wanaifanja kazi nyingi sana.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MTNTSTER FOR IAITDS AND SETTLEMET (Mr. Muturia) (contd. Kuna mabogi ya watu na ya mizigo, Pia, reli inatumikia nchi zingine ambazo hazina "bandari; kama vile Uganda, Sudan, Rwanda, Burundi na Zaire. Ningependa kutoa shulcrani zangu kwa shirika la Reli la Kenya, isipoicuwa kuna watu wengine ambao wanapewa huduma hii na hawana shukrani; wanawauwa watu wetu.Tukizungumaa kuhusu Halmashauri la Bandari ya Kenya, ninaweza kusema kwamba hakuna lingine katika Afrika mzima ambalo linaweza kusawazishwa nalo. Halmashauri la Bandari ya Kenya limejengwa kva njia ya kisasa, na pia lina tumikia Afrika na dunia nziiaa kwa kuwafunza watu wans.otumikia huduma za usafiri wa majini. Halmashauri hili lina jumba la mkutano ambalo hutumiwa na ulimwengu mzima wakati v/ana mambo kuiiusu usafiri wa majini.Tukizungumza kuhusu Shirika la Hdege la Kenya utaona kwamba ingawa inasemekana kwamba lina matatizo kadha wa kadha, hakuna sliirika lingine katika Afrika ambalo linaweza kujivuniwa. Sit a.Id kuongea mengi kuhusu mashirika mingine katika Afrika, lakini ukichunguza lava makini utaona kwamba ni Sliirika la Ndege la Kenya linaloendelea kweli. Ndege zake inaoridoka kutoka hapa nchini na kwenda kote ulimwenguni. Hata juzi juzi, ni ndege la Kenya ambalo lilimbeba.Mtukufu Rais mpaka huko Finland. Liliendeshwa na rubani wa Kenya, si mtu wa kukombolewa. lilifika na likarudi salama usalamini, UlcLsikia mambo Icuhusu mashirika mengine ya ndege, ni ma sliirika kwa jina tu. Mara nyingi huwa yanaendeshwa kwa njia ya faida tu.Tukizungumza Icuhusu Shirika la Posta na Simu, utaona kwamba hili ni shirika la ajabu sana, kwa sababu halcuna soko lolote katika ICenya ambalo ni la maana ambalo j halina simu. Kwa sasa wameanza lcutumia Subscriber Trunk Dialling   (S.T.D.).</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS AND SETTLEMENT (Mr. Muturia ) (Ctd. ) wakati wa ukoloni hungekuwa iia matumaini kwamba simu ingefika Mandera; Garissa; Liboi; Marsabit; au Moyale. Tunaposema hivl. sasa Moyale imeshapta huduma za kupiga simu mo ja kwa mo ja. Hii ni kuseam kwamba Siiirika is hili limefanya mambo mazuri na tunaendelea. Hata wameanzislia speed posta na unaweza lcutuma barua kwa harajca sana. Leo asubuhi nilipata barua kutoka Mombasa ambayo ilitumwa kutoka huko asubulii hii  sijui ilikuja na njia gani. Wameendelea sana, h.ata wameanza liata simu zile za karatasi. Hii ni kuonyeslia kwamba Kenya ime enda mbele sana na kila mtu katika nclii hii anafaa kujivunia.Kenya.Ukiangalia upande wa Transport Licsncing Board utapata kwamba kila gari lina faili yake. Ikiwa ni ajali imetokea, ukienda katika ofisi ya Transport Licencing Eoard huwezi kukosa faili ya gari yenyewe. Utaelezwa gari lililofanya ajali yenyewe. Mara mo ja tu utatolewa faili na hilo gari litajulikana ni la nani na limepitia mikono mingapi. Hii ni kuonyesha kwamba wana mipango maclhubuti.Ukiangalia upande wa Civil Aviation utaona kwamba katika anga la Kenya iiakujakuwa na ajali yoyote ya ndege lratokana na matatizo ya ukosefu wa uhodari wa kuendesha ndege. Zinaendeshwa na njia nzuri, na wataalaznu wetu wanaofanya kasi katika radars zetu wanaendelea vizuri sana. Ililo ni jambo la kujivunia.Ukiangalia hali ya anga utaona kwamba karibu watu kutoka Afr'ika nsima wanakuja liapa Nairobi kujua kwao kutakuwa aje; kutanyesba lini; kutakauka lini; kwa vile liawana vyomboe kajna zie zile tunavyo hapa. Kwa hivyo, kila mtu ni lazima ajivunie Kenya ili tupate kue-ndelea namna hiyo. Tunawatakia heri na ufanisi ili waendelee kufahya kz kazi kwa bidii.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS ME SETTLEMENT (Mr. Mutuxia) ctd:Tena ukiangalia, utaona kwamba watu hawa vote waraefuzu vizuri, baada ya kufanyiwauchunguzi mkali, na hilo ni jambo zuri sana.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS AND SETTELMENT (Mr. Muturia) Ctd:Kutokana na bayo, Bw. Spika, kuna kitu kimoja ambacho tungetakaIfizara hii itufanyie. Hmgependa Wizara hii itengeneze barabara ya lamikutoka Maili Tatu kupitia M'Nyiri Divisional Headquarters na kuelekeaMutuate Market hadi Mutuate Police Station na iungani shire na barabara ya	Isiolo na River Tula.  Mwendo kutoka Wajir hadi Meru na Nairobiutafupi sin-ia kwa kilometa 100. Barabara hii itakuwa rahisi kujenga kwasababu haina inito na shida nyingine za kuwasumbua mafundi wa mitambo kwakujenga madaraja. Kitu ambacho watafanya ni kuweka niifereji tu na samboyote yatakuvra sawa sava.Ningependa iaiishukuru Nizara hii kwa kitu kimoja. Kwa mfano,hapo aamani ilikuwa ni vigunu sana kwa watu wa Meru kuaafiri hadi ICituina hali sisi ni watu wa mkoa ramoja na tuko jirani. Faya yote yalisahabishwaMto Tana. Mto huu ulileta shida kva	wa Kitui. Kwa wakati huo, tulikuwa tunasafiri oka Meru hadi Nairobikupitia Machakos na Erwishowe kuelekea ICitui. Kwa wakati huu, tunapitia HeruNational Park au nawskilisho ya mhe. Nakiondo, kupitia Daraja ya Luseni natunaingia Kitui hadi Mombasa. Ningependa kuishukuru Wizara hii kwa Jjaabohili.Kitu cha inwisho ambacho ningependa ku iambi a tfizara hii ni juu ya> vipuli. Uafanyakazi wa Wizara hii wanafajiya kazi nzuri na nissa mashine^«t»isr&- tainiar-ySk-0 sawa lakini nyingi zimeharibika na hazifanyi kazi. Kwa sababu, vipuli vya trakta, kama vile, D4j D6, Caterpillar na kadhalika haviko us, utapata trakta hizi zote hazifanyi kazi katika kila wilaya. Hata tippers na loaders hazifanyi kasi. Ni lazima Wizara hii ifikiri sana juu ya vipuli ili wavinunue, magari haya yatengenezwe na yaanze kufanya kazi. Magari haya yote yakianza kufajiya kazi, kazi itafanywa haraka kwa vile tfizara hii ina mafundi. wa mitanibo wa kutosha.Kvra hayo machache, ninaunga mkono.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES (Prof. Sumbi):Thank ycu very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute to this Motion. First of all, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Minister and his staff; particularly, the Kenya Railways Corporation. This Corporation provides the cheapest leans, of transport to the wananchi and it has done a good job. I would like to thank the Kenya Railways for taking into account the four requests I made to them in 1984. I am glad to report to this august House that all of them have been answered favourably, that is, extension of the railway line to Makindu Hospital. We people who live at Makindu could not cross over water underneath the railway line; stoppage of passenger trains at Kathekani, Lfbuinzau and Kiboko was introduced and finally, last month the construction of level crossings at Mbuinzau and Kiboko was started. I would like to thank the Kenya Railways Corporation for a job well done.Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Corporation, the Ministry and Kenya can do more in terms of extending the railway line. In the past, we passed a private Motion requesting the extension of the railway line in other parts of Kenya.I hope that the Ministry and the Treasury will implement some of these Motions and extend the railway lines.There was a move some time back, to try and have the water that used stored to be utilized by trains before diesel came into use. This water that pass through where tbs wananchi live could be taken over by the Ministry of Water Development and be given to the people. The Corporation has no quarrel with them; they have provided water in many places. I think, if the Ministry of Water Development and the Corporation's section that deals with water, worked together, they could serve the wananchi better. I would like to suggest to the hon. Minister to do something about that.Time and again in this House, Questions are asked by hon. Members complaining about roads in their constituencies or in Kenya generally. We know that the resources we have are limited and there is no doubt about it.I feel that the resources that we allocate to roads, could be utilized better. For example, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a road is graded, murramed and it is certified that it has been done properly. After two rainy seasons, it becomes worse than it was before it was niurramed. I think we have the manpower, the brains, technology and people who can make sure when a job is done, it is done well. There is a saying which goes that if you do something, you either do it well or do not do it.For example, a road from Emali to Makueni in my constituency was murramed a couple of years ago and if nothing to it before the rains, the Minister would not be able to pass through that road on his way to the Divisional Headquarters at Makueni like he did last time. I hope that somethin would be done about that. Kibwezi is a new Division and I think it is leading in the nation in terms of horticultural farming. This is because we have six rail year round rivers and the residents grow citrus fruits, vegetables and a lot of horticultural crops are exported to Europe. I hope that roads would be constructed that area and that some of them would be classified and taken over by the Ministry.As I was saying before the Minister came into the House, I would like to thank him for the good job that the Kenya Railways Corporation has done. However, I have to make, a few complaints about the job that is done on roads.I would not like to accuse somebody who is outside if I am not able to prove that he has not done well. But every time I go to some of these placesp wananchi complain that officers maintaining these roads using tractors are selling dieself wire mesh, cement and soron. After the rains I find that culverts have been swept awayo This makes me feel that probably there is some truth in what wananchi have been complaining labout. Maybe the Minister or the Ministry will appoint some people from the Ministry as their private eyes to go on supervising the officers in the field to really ascertain whether some of these things do talce place in. some of these areaseSir, as I said I think if possible the Ministry should be given extra funds so that it can do a better job. I hope, as the Vote here shows, that some of this money will be utilised in Kibwezi Division. This is because at times, they say that the money allocated for classified roads in libvezi and Makueni Divisions is also lumped up together with the money allocated for Mombasa  Nairobi Road between Sultan EansiS and Tsavo River. Every time I ask the officers trHow come you have not graded this road; hew ccsne you have not done that although you snxsi had said that you would do that? they say that the money has been utilised on the Nairobi  Mombasa Road within that section that they are in chargeSir, I hope after passing this Vote these funds will be separated and some set aside for the main road and other funds for those feeder roads leading to this main road which passes through my constituency. This will enable us to check and make sure that there is no misappropriation of funds or resources at times Sir, most of the important points have been saidp and9 therefore with those few remarks. I beg to supporto</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: As ante Sana Bw. Spika, kwa kunipa xiafasi hii ili niseme machache.Jambo la kwanza Bw. Spika, ni kusema kwamba nitaungana na waheshimiwawenzangu kwa kutoa shukrani kwa Wizara hii kwenye upande wa simu ijapokuwa katika mawakilisho yangu ya Butere tunahitaji hizi telephone booths ziwekwe masokoniili watu waweze kupiga simu na kuwasiliana na ndugu zao ambao wako Nairobi.  Hii itawawezesha kuwasilianarna ndugu zao walio mbali hasa; wakati wa matangao Kwa hivyo9 wananchi wa Dutere wanahitaji kuwekewa telephone booths katika masoko yaliyoka Butere ili waweze kupiga simu.Jaffibo lingine ambalo ningependa kusesia ni juu ya Bunge hilio Wizara ireefanya mengi kuhusiana na mawasiliano katika Kenyaf lakininBunge hii ndilo linatawala Kenya kisheria. Ni lazima kila Mbunge awe na simu yake, Ningependa Waziri achukue nafasi ya kwanza kuona kwamba Bunge lenyeve lina mawasiliano.Bw. Spika, jana nilikuwa nikitaka kupiga simu kuitafuta taxi ije inichukue hapa Bungeni, lakini sikuweza kufanya hivyo. Sisi katika Bunge hatuwezi kupiga simu kwa sababu simu zimefungwa. au hazifanyi kazi wakati mwingine. Hata ile telephone exchange ya hapa Bunge ndiyo kuu kuu zaidi katika Kenya. Ki lazima Waziri ambaye ni Mbunge katika Bunge hili aanze ka kuirekebisha hii telephone exchange ya Bunge ili Bunge hili liweze kuwa na mavasiliano inazuri ya simu kv anza ili tuweze kuwasiliana na kila sehemu katika nchi hii. Nina sen a hivyo kwa sababu Vabunge katika shida kubwa kwa vile hawawezi kuwasiliana na watu wao kule nje.Jambo lingine ambalo ningetaka kutaja linahusu reli. Wimbo umekuwa ukiimbva hapa Bungeni tangu hilipoingia hapa 1963. Kila mwaka tunapozungumzaVote ya Wizara hii, ninauliza ile feasibility study iliyofanywa yakuiunganisha reli kutoka Butere, Mumias hadi Bungoma, itakuja lini. Sijuikama feasibility study hii inaningojea nife ili ije au nini. Lakini miakahneuda. miaka rudi, jambo hili hali jatimizwa. Tvynepitisha kwamba reli ipanuliwe hata katikaupande wa Kisii, yaani, ile reli ya Kericho na ile. nyingine ya kutoka Nanyukilakini hakuna jambo lolote jmbalo limefanywa. Ninakubalia na na mhe. Bi Asiyo alipesema kwamba tangu Wabeberu watoke hapa Kenya, zile relalizoacha hapandizo hizo hizo ambazo zinaendelea na hatujafanya maendeleo yoyote juu yake.TUmefanya maendeleo makubwa ka upande wa kilimo, lakini kwa upande wa relimaendeleo hayajaendelea sana. Isitoshe wananchi wadogo kutoka Nairobi, husumbukasana wanapokwenda Kisumu kwa gari la moshi. Utaona watu wengine wanapanda juuya wengine huko weingine wakipitia  kwenya wa madirisha na akina mama wanaanguka chinina ule uji mama alimbebea mtoto wake unamwagika sijui ni kwa nini waziriambaye nasikia anatembea sana, hajalitembelea. stesheni la gari la moshi hapa nairobi mwishowa nrwezi, ili azione shida za wananchi kwa macho yake. Pengine angewachukuiamaofisa wa televisheni ili wapige picha ili jambo hili liwekwekva rekodiili kuonyesha vile mwananchi wa kawaida anavyopata taabu.  Hata kama ni lazima tupate mikopo, basi natupewe mikopo ya kununuamabeheva ya kutoshaya kuwabeba abiria wa kwenda Kisumu, Butere na  kwingineko . Nasema hivyo kwa sababu kuna mfinyar.o mkubwa sana wa wananchi  wcngi wanaumia.Nikiendelea kuzungumza juu ya reli, wakati umefika kwa vile sasa tunastima, wa Waziri pamoja na maofisa wake,Jaianza kufikiria kama tunaweza kuanzishamagari ya mosh yanayoendeshwa na stima. Tuna stima za kutosha na ingefaa kama tungejaribu kufanya kazi nyingine katika reli kwa kutumia stima. Waziri alisema jana hapa kwamba rnizigo mikubwa mikubwa itakuwa ikibebwa kwa reli.Jambo hili lilisemva na waziri aliyekuwa mbele ya Waziri huyu na sasa huyu Wazirianarudia jarnbo hilo hilo na sasa limekuwa kama wimbo. Ni lini ambaoo jambo hililitatendeka. Jambo hili likiPanyika, Idara ya Reli itavaajiri watu wengi zaidi,lakini tunaf aha  kwamba haya magari makubwa yanayotumia . barabara zetu ndiyoyanaharibu barabara zetu na kazi ya kuhifadhi barabara hizi inachukua pesa nyingisana. Wakati umefika. Bv. Spika, kwa Waziri ambaye  turajua kwamba ni Waziriwa vitendo, kuserna kwawba kiasi fulani cha mizigo, hakitakuwa kikipitia kwa barabara bali kitapitia kwa relic Hata ikichukua miezi miwili, mizigo hii itakuwa ikipitiakwa relic Lakirii ninajua kwamba Waziri atakuwa na shida maana wakubwa vengine itsinaio wenye isgn magari haya makubwa. Kwa hivyo, ni lazima jambo hili liangaliwekwa mara tano au kwa mara sita na wimbo.unaendelea kuimbwa Lakini, ingefaa kamaWaziri angechukua juhudi niyo kwa sababu sisi kama Waheshimiwa Wabunge tunamvungamkono na kuserna kwamba mizigo mikubwa mikubwa ni lazima ifre ikibebwa kwa relina si kwa barabara ili tuweze kuendelea.Katika sehemu ya Buteref Bw. Spika. Kamati ya Maendeleo ya wilaya yaKakamega ilipitisha kwamba ile barabarajkutoka Sigalagala, kwenda mpaka Eutere,iwekwe lemi Vile vile, kamatieile ilipendekeza kwamba ile barabara ya kutokaStand; Kisa mpakarisalaba iwekwe lami na pia ile barabara nyingine ya kutoka Yala kupitia Weliboyi, Sabatia, mpaka Mumias, iwekwe lami. Vile vile, kuna ambayo ile barabara ya kutoka mumias kwenda Busia ambayo  haijatengenezwa. Tungetaka barabara hizi zitengenezwe kwa sababu Mbunge hawezi kuziweka. lami. Serikali ya Nyayo ndiyo inaweka lami barabara. Kuna wanasiasa vesvgine na wafanyakazi wengine wa Serikali ambao wanasema, "hakuna barabara za lami katika sehemu yetu. Mbunge atatuletea barabara za lami wakati gani?" Mhe. Mbunge haweki barabara kwenya lami bali ni wajibuwizara ya Serikali ya Nyayo kuiveka lami kwa barabara zetu. Mbunge hawezihata kutia murrum kwenya barabara. Atawezaje na tunafahamu mshahara wake? NiSerikali yetu ambayo ina wajibu wa kufanya kazi hiyo. Barabara ambazo zinaweza kutumiwa wakati wote, zimetengenezwa na Serikali na si Bw. Shikuku. Ni lazima pongezi iende to;a Serikali na si kva mhe. Mbunge kva sababu hakuna Mbunge yeyote anayetengeneza barabara. Hata ninaishukuru Serikali kwa kttweka murru katika barabara kule Butere na sasa huwezi kukwama kwenye barabara hizi wakati wa mvua kwa sababu zinaweza kutumiwa wakati wote. Wanancbi katika E sehemu hii wanaishukuru Serikali na si Bw. Shikuku kwa sababu hii Serikali ya Nyayo ndiyo imeifanya kazi hiyo. Watu wengine wanasema kvajnba hakuna maendeleo katika Butere lakini huwezi kukwama wakati wa mvua kule Batere kwa sababu barabara ni nzuri.Ni maendeleo ya ama gani. wanayotaka kule Butere? Hawa ni walaghai ambao wanaleta fitina kati ya watu wa Butere na Serikali. Hawa ndio Mwakenya kwa sababu Serikali ya Nyayo inafanya kazi nzuii. Kwa hivyo, wanaosema kwamba hakuna maendeleo kule Butere, ndio Mwakenya. wanawaambia vananchi kvamba hakuna maendeleo kule Ritere wakati tunajua kwamba kuna maendeleo makubwa kule Butere. Wao wanataka maendeleo ya aina gani? wananchi wa Butere wanafahamu kwamba kuna maendeleo kule.Jambo lingine ambalo ningetaka kutaja linahusu Shirika la Ndege la Kenya. Wakati nilikuwa nikiiwakilisha Afrika katika mikutano ya Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, hakuna hata siku moja ajribapo nilisafiri kwa ndege ?a Shirika la Uingereza? ijapokixwa wanasema nisafiri kwa ndege hizo. Pesa zote za kigeni ambazo ninatumia kwa kusafiri, zinakwenda kwa Shirika la Ndege la Kenya. Hata ninapofika kule London na kulikosa ndege ya Shirika la Ngege la Kenya, mimi ninalala kule London na kulingojea ndege Shirika la Ndege la Kenya. Hi kuweza kuer.deleza Shirika Mli letu la Ndege ni lazima kila kiongozi awe akilitumia r.a si kusafiri kwa Shirika la Ndege la Uingereza au kwa ndege mashirika mengine. Si jambo la busara kusafiri kwa ndege za mashirika mengine. Ni lazima tuzitumie ndege zetu ili kuenaeleza Shirika letu la Ndege la Kenya. Ajabu ni kwamba ninawaomba viongozi wengine wakisafiri kwandegs za Shirika la Ndege la Uingereza na Ufaransa na kadhalika. Ni laziina tuikuze Shirika letu la ndege. Wakati umefika wa kuwa na viwanja vyandege katika kila Mkoa Kwa mfano, makao makuu ya mkoa wa Magharibi hainaUwanja kwa ndege. Ni kwa nini hatuwezi kuwa na uwanja huu. Kuna uwanja wandege kule Kisumu na kwa hivyo, tungetaka kuwa na uwanja kama huo kule.Kakamegaambayo ni makao makuu ya Kkoa huo. Vile vile tungetaka kuwe na uwanja mw ingine wa ndege kule Mkoa wa Kaskazini Mashariki. Kila makao makuu wa Mkoa ni lazima iwe na uwanja wa ndege ili watu wetu waveze kusafiri kwa ndege kutoka kila sehemu ya nchi ili tuwe na njia nzuri ya mavasiliano katika Kenya hii.Ningetaka kujua kutoka kwa Waziri ni kwa nini ule uwanja wa ndege ambao ulisemekana utajengwa kule Kakamega haujajengva mpaka leo Ni lazima jambo hili litimizwe ili mawasiliano katika Kenya yave ya manufaa kva wananchi. Kwa hayo machache naunga mkono.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.MWAVUMQ: Ahsante sana, Bw. Spika, kwa kunipatia nafasi hii ili nijiunge na wabunge wenzangu kwa kumshukuru V&ziri kwa kazi zake nzuri kabisa ambazo amefanya. Kati ya zile kazi ambazo amewahi kufanya, sitasita kusema kwamba kazi nzuri ambayo amefanya kva upande wa posta na simuna hataKila sehemu katika Jamhuri yetu ina posta na sasa wananchi wa Kenya wanasata huduma bora ya posta na.simu hata sasa unaweza kupiga simu katika kila pahali, ms au unaweza kupigiva simu kutoka kila sehemu ya Kenya® Pia kuhusu vibanda vya simu, ningetaka kusema kwamba hili limelcuva jambo muhiirru kabisa kna wananchi wanaendelea latzitujnt. Ningetaka kuwaomba wananchi wavitumie vibanda hivi vizuri sana® Kazi ya posta imekuwa nzuri sana lakini wananchi wameanza kuiharibii' Kwa hivyo, ningetaka kuwaomba wabunge wawaambie wananchi katika sehemu zao kwamba wavitumie vile vibanda vya simu vizuri ili viweze kuisaidie kazi yetu katika nchi hii.Kazi nyingine nzuri ya ambayo imefanyva na Gzara hii, ni juu ya Kenya Ports Authority. Kalmashauri hii inafanya kazi nzuri na sasa ule wizi wa zamani sasa hauko tena na jambo hili linaonyesha wazi it kvamba mali ya venyewe inalindwa vizuri. Jambo lingine, Bw. Spika, linalohusu Halmashauri hii ya Kenya Ports Authority juu ya tile Bandari College.Bandari College inatumikia nchi za Afrika ya Masliariki pamoja na nchi za Afrika ya Kati. Ni matumaini yangu kuwa wizara itazidi kukipanua chuo hiclio ili Wafrika wote aiabao wanahitaji masomo y anay of unzwa katika chuo hicho waweze kuyapata hapo.Jambo lingine ambalo ningependa kulizungumzia ni kuhusu feri za Mtongwe na Likoni. Ningependa kumwambia Waziri kwamba katika kivuko cha Mbongwe kuna taabu sana zinazowalcabili wananchi. Feri hizi hazina kasi; hutembea kwa mwendo wa pole. Vile vile, wakati wa asubiihi ambapo kuna heka heka za watu wakienda kazini, poiisi huwa wanawashika watu w sz ambao huruka^feri hizo. Ningemwomba Waziri aone kwamba feri nzuri zenye mwendo wa kasi zinanuhuliwa  na kuletwa huko ili wananchi wasiwe wakichelewa kwenda kazini.Nikija upandej Likoni fsri, ningependa kusema kwamba gharama kubwa sana. wakati umef ika wa kufikiria mm ya kuipatia kampuni, ya Kenya Bus Services ule mkataba wao/aa-upatiwe kampuni nyingine. Kila iiiwaka kampimi hii hspandisha malipo ya kuvusha magari  hata ingawa bei ya diesel imeteremshwa. Wananchi wa kawaida wanashindwa kuvukisha magari yao mara nyingi kwani kivuko hicho kimekuwa ni ghafci kweli kweli. Vile vile, makampuni ha hata wenye tes mabasi hushindwa kuvukisha magari yao kwa sababu ya shida hii. Ewa hivyo, maendeleo katika upande wa  kusini wa Kisiwa cha Mombasa yamerudi chini kwa sababu Kenya Bus Services inatoza pesa nyingi sana. Ni matumaini kwamba badala ya Kenya Bus Services kupewa mkataba huo, Serikali it an&a kuiendej feri hiio Tunawatu wenye ujuzi na wanaoweza kufanya kasi hivyo ni matumaini yangu kwamba Serikali itaanza kuiendesha feri hiyo ili bei ya kivuko ipate kuwa chini wananchi waweze lcukitumia.Jambo lingine ni kwarnba nasikitika kusikia mhe. Bomettakisema kwamba Shirika la Reli la Kenya “limekufa”. Jambo la kusiki tisha ni kwamba mhe. Mbunge huya anasema mambo asiyoyajua. Katika mashirika yote ya Serikali, hili la Eeli ndilo linalofanya kazi nzuri zaidi ya yote mengine. Kwanza, malipo yakejVni mazuri na ni rahisi kabisa. Tena, hili ni Shirika ambalo lina usalama huwa haina nyingi zimepungua kabisac Kwa hivyo, ingefaa kama Bunge hili lingelitolea Shirika hili pongezi kwa kazi nzuri inayo fanywa na walcurugenzi na maofisa wanaoli end e sha. Mi ninaridhika na kupendeswa kabisa kwa ile kazi nzuri inayofanywa na Shirika hili. Shirika hili halina ufisadi wowote. Wafaaiya kazi wa Shirika hili wanaridhika na kazi inayofanyika hapo ni ya kuridhisha, Usafiri huwarfizuri na chakula, vile vile,huwa ni kisafi. Kwa hivyo, inge faa kama tungelipongeza na kuwauliza walcurugenzi walo kwa kuufanya utumishi kuwa mzuri sana.Jambo lingine ni kuhusu barabara. Barabara ya kutokaMombasa kwenda Nairobi imekuwa ni nyembamba. Kama tunavyojua, inatumika barabara hii inatumika sana. Kama hukuwezekani kujengwa barabara ya pili, ingefaa barabara hii ipanuliwe ili kupunguza ajali. Ni jambo la kusikitisha kuona kwamba kila mara barabara hii	na ajalii Barabara hii imeleta maafa mengi sana. Utaona kwaiaba watu h wengi maarufu wa nclii hii wamepoteza maisha yao katika barabara hiyo.	Nikirudi upande wa Shirika Reli, ningependa kuwashulcuru kwa kuwasafirisha watoto kutoka Mombasa, waliokaja hapa. Nairobi ili too kushiriki katika Kichezo ya Nne ya Bara la Afrika watoto hao waliletwa Nairobi .na kurudishwa Mombasa kwa usalama.Jambo lingine  ni kwamba ningemwomba Waziri awe akitu tembelea ili azione zile sehemu ambazo waheshimiwa Wabunge wanazungu mzia wakisema kwamba zinahitaji barabara. Ningependa kumshukuru Waziri kwa kutengeneza ile barabara inayoelekea IJtongwe kwenye kampila Jeshi la wanamaji. Mimi hajua kwamba Waziri ni mtu mwenye bidii na mtu anayependa kazi yake. Kwa hayo machache, nasemaahsante sana kwa kazi anayoifanya. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KANIITDO: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me a chance to thank the Ministry for the good workthey are doing. First of all, I would like to congratulate the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation for the good work they are doing all over the country. I must say that this is one of the corporations that is using the money it is given by this House properly because it is trying all it can to reach wherever it can with the little money it is given. I would only like  to appeal to the corporation to instal more telephone booths at Awendo Trading Centre, Homa Bay and in all the other places where they are required by the public. I would also like to thank the corporation for installing the Subscriber Trunk Dailing (S.T.D.) facility in Homa Bay, such that now a caller does not need to go through the operator when he wants to call Homa Bay.But I must remind the corporation that two years ago, the telephone line between Hombo and Homa Bay was started and the poles were there, but still the wires arenot connected, to avoid going through Kisii in order to get Homa Bay from Awendo and Migori. This line was supposed to get a direct link. I would also like to remind it of telephone posts which were put between Nyangweso and Ndiru which are not complete yet. It is now two year's since then. I do not know what happened. Despite the fact that a good job was done, maybe the budget was not enough or maybe something went wrong some where. I would, therefore, like to appeal to the corporation to connect these lines whose posts had already been put.I would also like to urge the Kenya Port Authority to continue working as it is doing now. Since the amalgamation of the Kenya Ports Authority and the Kenya Cargo Handling Services Limited, the income of the Authority has increased considerably. I am sure that some of the Questions which are brought here by some hon. Members might be related to many years back before the amalgamation. The revenue that the Authority is bringing to the Government is tremendous and it has improved. This is very important, and credit should be given where it is due.I would also like to talk about the Kenya Railways Corporation. This corporation is trying to do all it can, but I do not know what is happening to the many Motions that have been passed in this House, particularly concerning the railway line which could have served Homa Bay via the South Nyanza Sugar Company to Kuria, which would have eased the tranportation problems. This could also have been used by thosepeople who would have wished to travel by train to case the congestion on our roads. In this connection, may I suggest that the corporation builds shades at the piers for those people who use steamers at Homa Bay, Kamito and Kisumu because during the rainy season, the travellers have it rough. They should build shelter for travellers, even if it means the travellers paying a small fee if the Government does not have enough money to build them. These shelters will cater for the young, the elderly and even those who are able-bodied.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the improvement on this area is very vital and should he taken very seriously. May I also talk about the airports. I must thank the Ministry for tarmacking Homa-Bay and Migori airstrips, but it would also be fair if they could be expanded to be able to a accommodate the big aeroplanes. We need to boost the Kenya Airways by first of all starting the domestic flights. Those who would like tu use them should be provided with this facility. Starting domestic flights should be part of our campaign to see that those small air¬strips are expanded to cater for more traffic so that we can get more income. We should make people aware that these airports could be very useful if they are located in many areas. In this connection I support hon. Shikuku that we need slightly bigger airports in every Provincial Headquarters so that those who would want to travel faster could use them just like is the case with railway services.I would like to draw the attention of the Ministry to thefact that it has been a practise to find that coaches which are assigned to go to Kisumu and Malaba are older than those which are to assigned to Mombasa. Just now, hon. Mwavumo has said that they are fantastic. The coaches destined for Mombasa are totally different from those going to Kisumu. I do not know whether this is happening because there are so many tourists going to Mombasa or not. But if this is the case, then the Ministry concerned should now open-up new parks along Kisumu line, so that more tourists can also visit this area where they can see many things. If you take South Nyanza District for example, the length of the tarmacked road that we have there does not exceed 50 kilometres. The only portion which is tarmacked covers Rongo/Hoaa-Bay, although Pap Onditi-Kendu-Bay Road is now being tarmarcked, it will not allow tourists to see many things in that area. This is why I would appeal to the Ministry to think seriously and reorganise themselves so that Koyugi via Rodi K'Opany to Karungu-Bay is tarmacked. Homa-Bay to Mbita road shouldalso be tarmacked. They should as also complete Kendu-Bay - Homa-Bay road to make the circuit ready for tourists so that we can get good buses which go to the Coast going to Kisumu. I must also say that it is time that we got faster trains to enable some of us to travel faster. It is the high time they considered constructing good railway lines to cater for electric trains. Matatus should be given a different name because the name Matatu originated from the fact that matatu operators used to charge commuters 30 cents. Since they no longer charge that amount, we should call them a different name. We have appealed to the Minister severally in this House that he should introduce gadgets for matatus like the ones that are used in lifts, so that when they are overloaded, they do not move. I do not know whether they are considering doing this because many people are dying on our roads because the matatus have no speed governors and there is no limit to the number of commuters that they can carry at once. Some accidents occur because some drivers are paid on speed basis. They are told "If you drive to Mombasa of Nakuru twice or thrice, then your pay will go up". This makes these people to drive as fast as they can.However, if gadgets like those used in the lake are installed, the number of deaths in this case can be reduced. In this case, there will be no way matatus will overload as much as to cause a tyre burst. This also applies to buseso On the road from here to Nakuru, you will find that buses faster than small cars. If you witness an accident which such a bias has been involved in, you find that nearly all the passengers have die. Many han.members have suggested that the speed limit that used to be there before should be put back because it was helping in this regard.Mr. Speaker, Sir, hon. Members have talked about heavy vehicles on the road which are causing many deaths at night. Imagine that you are driving a small vehicle and a trailer is coming behind you. Unfortunately, it has been said that many such trailers belong to “big men” and that it is impossible to control the vehicles. However, when you compare the value of people dying in these circumstances to the amount of money the vehicles generate, you find that the two sides do not balance. If you take the number of people dying in this country per year, you find that it is very big. I would like to urge the Ministry to continue doing the good work it is doing. There should be co-operation among top officials of the Ministry in co-ordinating the Ministry's worksWith these few remarks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. arap KOSKE: Thank ycu very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving mean opportunity to contribute this Motion. First of all, I would like to thank the Minister, and the entire staff of the Ministry for having prepared this particular Motion. I would urge the Ministry to see to it that all the signboards that are missing are now replaced before we run out of money. Between Mau Summit and Sotik in Eericho District, most of the road does not have road signs, except for the bare posts sticking out beside the road. I think it is high time that these signs were replaced. I would also like to urge the Ministry to look for material that is good enough for road signs only and cannot be used for any other purpose.This is because sign posts are always supposed to be on the road where there is no security.If those signs are made of material that can be used for other purposes, these signs will definitely be stolen.Another point relates to the speed of vehicles. This has been talked about over and over again. Most fatal accidents occur due to very high speeds on the road. It was even said some time back that public vehicles should be fitted with speed governors so that they do not overspeed. However, up to now, as other speakers here have said, the big buses move even faster than small cars. If it has been impossible to fit these vehicles with speed governors, I would suggest that we have bumps in most of these dangerous places. In particular, I would say that in Kedowa Town, Kericho, Kaputirr Market, Kapsuser and Kapkelei in Kericho District are dangerous places for very fast vehicles. So, I urge the Ministry to see that it builds bumps in those places to reduce the number of fatal accidents which occur tbere every now and then.While still on this point, I would like to urge the Ministry to pay more attention to newly-settled areas like Kipkelion, in Londiani, which used to be for Europeans. Now that wananchi have settled there, we need many roads in that place. He have a lot of maize, coffee and other crops there, but farmers are losing a lot because they cannot transport their milk to the Kenya Co-operative Creameries depots; maize to the National Cereals and Produce Board, and so on. Even tea and coffee produce sometimss overstay in plantations and thereby lose its value because there are no roads by which to transport it.Coming to bridges, it is not wise or good to wait until a bridge falls down. Over the weekend, I inspected a bridge at Tested, in Londiani Division, Kericho District where a loaded tractor had fallen into the river because the bridge had got broken Bridges should be inspected every now and then to make sure that when they get old, they do not cause accidents. At such times, all vehicles should be banned from Using such bridges. I am also of the opinion that we should send our road engineers back to training because I wonder why most of our roads now just peel off immediately they are made. There must be something wrong with our engineers; either they are not qualified or they do</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. arap KOSKE (CTD.):not use the money that is supposed to be used in this respect. They may be swindling some of this money. Therefore, something should be done about this. We cannot afford- to spend a lot of money on a road and then it becomes useless within only two years time. This is a big challenge to the Ministry. It has been said that we should employ local people to take care of roads where they are in order to ease off the situation. Most of our workers, I am sorry to say,are not trusted and they do not do their work properly,, However, if somebodyis told, "You are going to take care of the road section between this and these places", I am of the opinion that he will be likely to do a good job because he knows that when a road inspector comes within six months, it will be known very clearly that it was he himself who never did his k job. However, with various people working in various parts, when a mistake occurs, it is very difficult to determine who exactly caused the mistake, and that gives useven more problems. So, I am of the; opinion that particular sections of our roads should be given to particular people so that when the road inspector comes after a certain time, he is able to question the particular person concerned. With regard to toll stations, they are very useful because they aregiving us a lot of money, but here is a case where somebody lives next to atoll station. It might be a teacher who has get to pass through the tollstation everyday going to school. I feel that the Minister should do somethinghere. There may be a case where a teacher has to go through the station aboutsix times a day. He goes to school in the morning, comes back for tea break,goes back to school, comes back for lunch, goes to school and then comes homein the evening. This teacher is made to pay toll charges six times in a day. Wherea person lives next to a toll station, I think there should be some allowanceof some sort so that maybe he pays only once or twice in a day; otherwise, paying toll charges every time he goes through the station will be unfair to him. Somebody may go out to distribute milk and if the toll station is near hishouse, he will be forced to pay toll charges several times a day. This is a case in which</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. arap KOSKE (CTD.):which I feel the Minister should, consider so that he gives some allowance to people who are forced to go through the toll station every now and then "because they live close to the station.Mr. Speaker, Sir, wananchi have complained several times abouttelephones. When they get out of orders, some telephones stay for months without "being attended to and put in order. However, when the telephone bill comes, it does not exclude the time when the telephones were out of order. So, I would urge the Ministry to see to it that telephones are repaired immediately they are reported to be out of order. If they are not repaired for a reasonable amount of time, the owners should not be made to pay for the time they have not used them because that was not of their own making.Coming back to roads, we have said repeatedly this is not a new thing; it is a very clear idea that when you allow water to run over long distances, it not only destroys roads, but also erodes the land. In that case, roads will not last long</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KOSKE (ctd);Mr. Speaker- Sir, there is a road which runs from Kokwet to Port Tertian. I raised a Question in this House regarding that road. You will find that when it rains water runs almost seven kilometres along the road. This could be happening to other roads in this country and it should he stopped, Water should not be allowed to run along the road for such a long distance. This is because it destroys the road.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have some tiling to say about road blocks. The police should be advised to mount road blocks at very clear and convenient places. They should not mount road blocks around corners. Some two weeks ago a road block was mounted on a hilly side a few  kilometres from Kericho Town. One vehicle failed to stop when it approached the road block. It was moving slowly but the brakes failed and as a result of this it ran over the spikes and caused an accident. So, I feel that the police should be advised to place road blocks at appropriate places where accidents are not likely to occur. If a road block is mounted at a corner and a vehicle which is moving fast approaches that point an accident will occur.We have appealed to the Government to introduce a passenger train service to operate during the day between Nairobi and Kisumu. But up to now nothing has been done. I would like to ask the Ministry of Transport and Communications to make sure that we have this service. We would also like the Ministry to establish more railway stations in the country.With those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Khasakhala): Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me time to say a few words on this Motion. First of all I would like to thank the Minister and his staff for their efficiency and hard work. This is also because quite a lot of things have improved since the Minister moved to that Ministry. I am very pleased to give him my compliments. I have personally seen a lot of improvements being carried out by this Ministry.Secondly I would like to say that the Kenya Airways limited has very wonderful pilots. Although the planes are old the pilots have managed them very well throughout. I fly Kenya Airways at least twice a week and I knew how efficient these people are. I just wish the Minister could try and get more money so that we can acquire new planes for domestic flights and increase the number of flights between Nairobi and Kisumu instead of making one flight per day. We should have two flights; one in the morning and another one in the afternoon throughout the week. The is because the number of passengers travelling between Kisumu and Nairobi warrant frequent flights.  Quite a number of people are left in Kisumu. So, you will find that the plane that operates between Kisumu and Nairobi cannot cope with the number of passengers. But s although there are delays no Kenya Airways pilot will take off if he knows that the aircraft has a mechanical problem. That is very good because they have saved our lives. I do not mind being delayed because the plane is being maintained. But I would like to ask the Minister to increase the number of engineers and mechanics who should be checking these planes immediately they arrive so that the mechanical faults are not discovered by the pilots when they are trying to take off. These mechanical problems should be detected by the mechanics or engineers in charge of the places. When the engineer comes to check on the plane he should</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Ehasakhala) (ctd);be able to detect these mechanical problems so that we are not delayed when the pilots discover the mechanical problems when they are taking off. We can manage the Mombasa route	easilywith the DC9s. Instead of using Fokker Friendships along this route we should use DC9s. This is because the distance from Mombasa to Nairobi is very long and if you fly a Fokker Friendship from Mombasa to Nairobi you will be over-working it. You will find that the same aircraft flies to Kisumu, back to Nairobi and then to Mombasa and proceed to Malindi. That is over-working the plane. I think the Fokker Friendship should be left to operate between Kisumu and Nairobi only. Let us have other smaller planes to cater for tourists going to Malindi. They could be ferried from Malindi to Mombasa in small planes and then flown, from Mombasa, to Nairobi. That would save a lot of time.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to commend the Kenya Ports Authority. I have personally visited the Kenya Ports Authority in Mombasa and I can tell this House that the work that goes on there is earning this country a lot of money. The Kenya Ports Authority see is quite efficient. Some Members of Parliament have complained in this House about the performance of the Kenya Ports Authority. But I would like to say that these are human mistakes. The Kenya Ports Authority is thorough and very efficient. But I think there is always room for improvement.I would also like to suggest to the Minister that he can use the railway to ferry containers from Mombasa to Nairobi. No lorry should be used to carry sea containers from thePort of Mombasa to Nairobi. Let us use the train to Malava. Let</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Khasakhala)(ctd);a big inland container depot be built at ma Malava. They have constructed an inland container depot here in Nairobi. If we construct one at Malava we will have saved our roads. At the moment we are spending huge sums of money on road maintenance. This is because the roads are being damaged by lorries carrying huge loads. If we use the Kenya Railways Corporation to ferry trains from Mombasa to Nairobi, and from Nairobi to Kisumu ana Malava I am sure we can save a lot of money. But as long as we allow these heavy lorries and trailers to use our roads I am sure that our roads will remain in a poor state; they continue to have potholes.I agree that we have very fantastic highways in Kenya today. Compared to many other African countries I think we are number one. There is no other African country which has highways which can compare well with the Kenya highways. Uganda used to compete with us but it has now gone to the dogs. I think we are the best in the whole of East and Central Africa. I have never been to South Africa but I still think that we have the best roads in Africa. I would like that standard to be maintained. Let us keep maintenance units within limited distances. We should not have a maintenance unit more than six kilometres away from the road to be maintained. Let us have road maintenance, units within easy reach so that if a pothole develops on the road it can be filled up immediately. If a pothole is found on the road then we will know that the person in charge of maintaining that particular portion of the road is not working at all. At the moment you can find potholes lasting mone month on the road and you are left wondering whether the Ministry's people are doing any tiling at all.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Khasakhala) (ctd);If it were possible we could even have maintenance units in every division in this country so that they can maintain the countryside roads. Every division in the country should have aunit to maintain roads within that division. I am talking aboutadministrative divisions. We can have a maintenance unit in everydivision so that they can maintain roads whenthey are washed away by rain water. At the moment there areroads which have not seen a tractor for a long time simplybecause the district road maintenance unit does not know what ishappening. Even if a culvert breaks you will find that a holewhich is very dangerous remains there for a very long time untilwe start complaining to the district development committees.I thought that with the District Focus for Rural DevelopmentStrategy now we could do very much. This is because people fromthe divisions attend district development committees meetingsand they complain. But when they complain no one takesnote of that. Maybe if we have a road maintenance unit in everydistrict it sis might save the situation. This will also reduce thenumber of road accidents that are occurring in many parts of thecountry.I do not understand why we have discontinued the train service between Butere and Kisumu. We used to have this service twice a week. We used to have a passenger train leaving Kisumu in the afternoon and spending the night at Butere and going back in the morning, crossing the other one from Nairobi. If this service is reinstated the congestion of passengers at Luanda and Yala will be eased.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>TIE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Khasakhala)(ctd. ):You find that in places like Yala and Luanda children are thrown through the windows in order to get into the train, something that is very dangerous. As we have always said, the railway system is the best transport method we have although it does not make money. I was in the Railways Corporation for 10 years as an advisor and I know that no railway line makes profit all over the world. What we are asking for is the service; let us see how best we can maintain this service for wananchi. I am afraid that if we went in for profits, that cannot be attained. Nowhere in the world does any railway line make profit, leave alone Kenya. I have studied the railway system throughout and I know what I am talking about. A railway system has to be subsidised by some funds from elsewhere. Since the railway service is first class, let us have some of those good coaches like the ones going to Mombasa also going to Kisumu so that when we are tired of going by road we can use a train and sleep the whole night ana get to Nairobi in the M morning to start working. If the good coaches that go to Mombasa could also go to Kisumu, I am sure our trips would be made comfortable. I am sure that one day the. Minister for Transport and Communications will take a ride to Kisumu so that he can see some of these things for himself.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation has improved fantastically. I am glad that the Corporation has installed telephone booths all over the country. If you want to know that those telephone booths are useful, just look at the queues behind them. The telephone booths have taught people how to queue. I wish wananchi were queuing for buses the same way the queue to make telephone calls. You find that at a telephone booth, someone who comes first starts the line so that the second man queues behind him and so on so that everyone has a chance to use the telephone. In view of the importance of these telephone booths, why can we not increase them so that we can have them in every public office. For example, we do not require only one telephone booth outside Government offices. Jogoo Ho vise needs about six telephone booths so that civil servants can use them instead of using Government telephones in the offices. I feel</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR IFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Khasakhala) (ctd.):that the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation could still do better byintroducing subscribers Trunk Dialing system throughout the country. The old systemof booking calls through the telephone operator has really annoyed some of us because you may book a call through k the operator and then it takes a full day for you to be connected to where you wanted. In fact, sometimes you do not get the call at all until the next morning, and then you wonder what happens to the operators. Sc, if we could have S.T.D. system introduced all over the country, I am sure that this would speed up telephone communication system. I recommend that Maseno be considered for the next installation of the S.T.D. system.With those few remarks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KINYANJUI: Thank you very much, Hr. Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to say a few words in supporting the Vote of this important Ministry, when the Minister was moving his Vote, he mentioned that it is the objective of the Ministry to have all-weather roads in the future. When he replies, we would like him to give us some time scale and tell us when, in the future, the country will have all-weather roads. Practically every hon. Member who has, spoken on this Motion in this House has emphasised the importance of having good road systems. The rural access roads are the ones which are used by wananchi, and we would request the Ministry, when preparing the 1988/89 budget, to consider having more money so that we may improve all the rural access roads.Mr. Speaker, Sir, in my own constituency, there are two roads which have been recommended by the diet district development committee for tarmacking. I have in mind the Gachie-Riron road via Nyathuna, including the Ruko-Waginge section. This roads serves a very rich horticultural area, and I do hope that the Ministry will do everything possible to ensure that it is  tarmacked so that it may serve wananchi who feed Nairobi with horticultural products. There is another section of a road which has also been recommended by the district development committee and this is the Kutarakwa-Gikambura road. This road was earmarked for tarmacking by the Ministry way back in 1985, and the wananchi in the area are still waiting to see</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KINYANJUI (ctd.):that road, improved so that development in the area could be enhanced.Sir, when we consider the corporations and departments which fall under the Ministry of Transport and Communications, we realise that they are of great importance. Starting, with the Kenya Ports Authority, I would like to point out that this is the gateway to our country. The bulk of our imports and exports pass through the Port of Mombasa. It is, therefore, important that the port should be modernised. I do not think there should be any difficulty in this House approving loans for the modernisation of Mombasa Port. There was a proposal that we should have a second port and a site was recommended. We would like the Minister to tell us what happened to the establishment of the second port. We should not rely only on one port because anything could happen, landing us into problems in having our traffic moving. Before I leave the Kenya Ports Authority, let me say that there are certain areas of development which could be ignored even by otherwise very hard working officers. The provision of navigational aids is very crucial, and I would request the Kenya Ports Authority not to ignore the provision of such facilities if these are not provided, you could have an accident at the port entrance and then you could have the normal flow of the shipping traffic interrupted. I do hope that the Kenya Ports Authority will give attention to this aspect.Mr. Speaker, Sir, touching on the Kenya Railways Corporation, I have in mind the need for long term planning. We have seen the human traffic in Nairobi City increasing so much, and I do not think that matatus and buses will be able to cope with the increasing human traffic. There is need, therefore, for the Kenya Railways Corporation to consider  providing railway transportation from the suburbs of Nairobi. It would be of great importance if the Corporation could plan to have a circular railway line going all along the suburbs and having a central station. This is very important, and I do hope that the Corporation will give this s proposal a very serious consideration.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KINYANJUI (ctd.):Sir, people living in the areas outlying many of the main urban areas, particularly Nairobi and Mombasa, are living far away from the town centres. For example, my Kikuyu Constituency is now a suburb of Nairobi such that people working in the city have to move every morning' from that suburb into the city and go back in the evening.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>ART	MR. KINYANJUI (Contd.):The people who work in Nairobi and have to move out to some 30 kilometres out must be provided with better transportation than the existing one. That is why I proposed that the Kenya Railways Corporation should introduce faster trains. I do not think this is an impossibility. They should consider having electrified lines. If what the Minister said will materialise, that is the establishment of a second railway line, it should be, if possible, electrified so that we could have faster trains.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation has provided excellent services when they have been expanding telephone and postal services in the rural areas. We suggest that that good effort should continue until every market has a telephone and postal services. With this in mind, we have an approved proposal by the district development committee (D.D.C.). That is to establish postal services at Gikuni Trading Centre. We have been waiting for this service, and I do hope that the Corporation will do everything possible to establish one there.Mr. Speaker, Sir, when I come to the question of the Kenya Airways, the new team has been very well selected, and I do hope that they will tackle the existing problems. One problem that has existed all along and I do not know when it will be got rid of is the fact that if you go to book Kenya Airways, as hon. Shikuku says, every time you are told that it is "overbooked". The computer says so. But when you go to the aero plane, you find that it is half empty! I am sure that those of us who come from Mombasa, or travel from Nairobi to Mombasa are quite familiar with this habit. We are told that the aero plane is "overbooked", but on getting onboard you find that it is half empty. If you go to London, you find the same thing. If you try to book the Kenya Airways, you are told “it is overbooked". If you get into the aero plane, you find that most of the travellers</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KINYANJUI (Contd.):who use the Kenya Airways alight in Rome, and the aero plane will arrive here, Nairobi, empty having left some Kenyans who wanted to travel Kenya Airways. But due to lack of seats in the Kenya Airways they have to travel by the British Airways (B.A.).So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the Minister, and the new team of the Kenya Airways should look into this problem so that our airline becomes efficient. They should not rely on computers because they go wrong. We all know that the information we get from the computer is as good as the information we feed in. So, there must be some other human methods of checking whether the bookings are corrects.Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me commend this Ministry and the Minister and as he used to do when he was in the Ministry of Health, he should do the same here. He should pay surprise visits to the rural access roads and see to it that they are passable.Thank you, Sir. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Kisiero): Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me a chance to contribute to this Motion.Sir, roads, railways, shipping, Kenya Airways, and many others the elements of communication do make a great contribution to the development of any country. Roads, in particular, arc very, very important .in Kenya, particularly in areas where agriculture is contributing to the economy of this country. I have mentioned roads because we have had a problem with roads in Mr. Elgon. This is a problem which has been with us for more than 20 years now.We do agree that the district focus for road development is expected to be the guide for the development of any district. But the district development committees (D.D.C.) are rule by human beings, and sometimes human beings decide to do what they feel, or what they would like to do to satisfy their own particular areas.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Kisiero) (Contd.):Now, in the case of Mt.

SIHKUKD: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I know according to the Standing Orders, we are required to end the debate at 5.00 o’clock. But from the practical point of view, we have had occasions at least five occasions where in Committee Stage where we are supposed to take long, we take about ten minutes and thematter is over. I was wondering. Sir, if you could allow two or three hon. Members to speak because at Committee Stage there will be no business at all? I do not have my books here and the hon. Angatia is not here. Therefore, it will take about ten minutes to finish the business. Can two or three hon. Members be allowed to speak?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

So, it is now time for the Mover to reply.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Magugu): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have no problem in giving two or three hon.

Yes!</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Kisiero): I am so grateful, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to the hon. Minister and also to your ruling.

Chabera Market lies along the electricity line to Sondu and only a trans¬former and distribution network that requires to be provided.The cost would be shs.270,000/-</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MBORI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, arising from the reply given by the Assistant Minister that electricity to East Kabondo would be made available only after the South Nyanza District</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MBOBI (Contd.):Development Committee has met and made recommendations, is he aware that the South Nyanza DDC has sat down and given its approval way back in 1986? So I do not seem to understand what the Assistant Minister is saying.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ADICHAHEH: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is not aware that the DDC has passed this. We are not in a position saying that the DDC has passed this. According to the information I have, the South Nyanza DDC has not passed this. It has to go through the DDC and be given priority.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MBQRI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I wonder whether the Assistant Minister has already given a reply to part (b) of my Question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ADICHAREH: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have given the required answer to the effect that Kabondo is being considered in the Rural Electrification Programme along with this Chabera Market.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MBORI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, with all due respect, Kabondo is just one of the locations in this Oyugis Division. Since Oyugis Rural Electrification Programme has already been started, I fail to understand the logic behind the Minister's argument as to why Kabondo should be excluded from this programme and considered under a very small nucleus called Chabera, and not under Oyugis Division as a whole.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ADICEAREH: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I have said, Kabondo will also be considered for rural electrification when funds are available. </Newspeech><Header> Question No. 541 </Header> MR. WAKIONDO, on behalf of Mr. Mate, asked the Minister for Agriculture:-(a)	how many cotton farmers from Embu District have not been paid for their 1986 crop and when they will be paid; and(b)	what action he has taken to ensure that cotton farmers are paid on delivery of their produce.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER PCS AGRICULTURE (Mr. Muigai): Mr. DeputySpeaker, Sir, I beg to reply. </Newspeech>(a)	All farmers in Embu District have been paid for their 1986Crop.(b)	Arrangements are being made so that farmers can be paid promptly in future. This involves making funds available to pay farmers for their deliveries.<Newspeech>MR. MUTISO. Would the Assistant Minister tell the House when these farmers are going to be paid.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUIGAI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, a total of Shs.7,500,380.95 was paid to Embu branch managers, and this represented the all the cotton</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUIGAI (CTD.):delivered in I986. This cheque was actually delivered on the day of the Embu Agricultural Show.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAKIONDO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, arising from the Assistant Minister's reply to part (h) of the Question, would he be specific enough and tell this august House what arrangements there are for future payments and whether farmers are going to paid on delivery of the crops? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUIGAI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, instructions have been given by His Excellency the President, as the Member will probably know, that farmers be paid on delivery of their crops. </Newspeech><Header> Question No. 520 </Header> MR. MUTISO asked the Minister for Agriculture:(a) whether he is aware that Mr. Bernard Muli, a former employee of the Coffee Board of Kenya, was seriously injured while on duty on 26th September, 1985; and(b) when he will be paid his compensation and how much he will be paid.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE (Mr. Muigai): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(a)	The Minister is aware that Mr. Bernard Muli, formerly with the Coffee Board of Kenya, was seriously injured while on duty on 26th September, 1985.(b)	A payment of She. 1,960/= is now ready and Mr. Muli can collect his cheque from the Coffee Board of Kenya in Nairobi.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTISO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister repeat his answer because he spoke away from the microphone and I could hardly hear him?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FCR AGRICULTURE (Mr. Muigai): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(a) The Minister is aware that Mr. Bernard Muli, formerly with the Coffee Board of Kenya, was injured while on duty on 26th September, 1985.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE (Mr. Muigai) (Ctd.) :(b) A payment of Shs. 1,960/= is now ready and Mr. Muli can collect his cheque from the Coffee Board of Kenya in Nairobi.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTISO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if the Assistant Minister agrees that Mr. Muli was seriously injured, does he consider that a compensation of Shs. 1,960/= is in keeping with the extent of the injuries suffered?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUIGAI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is a subjective observation. Such payments as this one are set out in a pre-determined formula in respect of how compensation is paid. It will not be appropriate for me to say whether I am satisfied, or not in this case as this is not a decision that I have any leeway to make. </Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: Arising from that reply, which is as-sad.as another onehe gave yesterday, does hip conscience trouble him, being an elected representative of the people? Somebody is injured so seriously and yet he is only paid Shs.1,960/=. In the case related yesterday, the compensation paid was only Shs.969/=. Could he not take it upon himself to initiate an amendment to the Act he is talking about so that people are paid compensation reasonably? Shs. 1,000/= is very little. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUIGAI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, hon. Martin Shikuku is in as good a position as I am to bring up such an amendment. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIKUYU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, before I ask Question No. 530, I would like to correct the names "Kiandanda" and "Mwala' to read "Kiandani" and "Mung'ala" respectively.</Newspeech><Header> Question No. 530 </Header> MR. KEKUYU asked the Minister for Lands and Settlement:-(a)	whether he is aware that land adjudication in Kiandani-Nwala-Kasinga Adjudication Area was completed a long time ago;(b)	whether he is further aware that residents of this area have not been given their title deeds; and(c)	when they will be issued with these title deeds. <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS Aim SETTLEMENT (Mr. Muturia): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am sorry I did not clearly hear the amendment that the hon, Member made could he be very clear?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIKUYU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there are typing errors in part (a) of the Question. The first name there is Kiandani, and not Kiandanda; and the second name is Nwala, and not Munyala.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS AND SETTLEMENT (Mr. Muturia): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(a)	It is true that land adjudication work was completed in the Nwala Adjudication Section some two months ago. Title deeds have not been issued because there is a dispute involving Machakos Forest and the two adjudication sections under reference, but this is being rectified. Kasinga Adjudication Section has not completed land adjudication because there have been so many objections lodged by the parties concerned' which have taken a lotof time to dispose of.(b)	Yes, I am aware that the residents of this area have not yet been given title deeds.(c)	We expect title deeds for the three adjudication sections to be ready in the first quarter of this year. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

MUTURIA: Yes, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. </Newspeech><Header> Question No. 3692 </Header> MR. arap KOSKE. asked the Minister for Lands and Settlement:-(a)	who the current legal owner of L.R. No. 6087; situated at Fort Ternan in Kericho District is;	when the said land was referred to Kericho District Land Board for the necessary transactions;	whether he is aware that there are squatters who have been living on the said land for the last 20 years; and	whether he could direct that these squatters be allowedto buy a portion of the land since they have nowhere else to settle.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS AND SETTLEMENT (Mr. Muturia): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(a)	First of all, Parcel L.R. No. 6087 No longer exists because it was sub-divided into the following two portions: firstly. L.R. No. 11889, of 8.l7 hectares owned by the Kenya National Museums; and secondly, L.R. No. 6087/2, of 218.133 hectares owned by Mr. Humphrey Mwangi Watoro.(b)	The Kenya National Museums, being a Government institution, did not require consent from the. Land Control Board. On the other hand, Mr. Watoro applied for consent in June, 1972, and approval for the transaction was obtained in August, 1972.(c)	The presence of squatters on the land was not reported when the application for the transaction was made in June, 1972, as stated above. However, later in 1984? the presence of some squatters there was reported by the District Commissioner.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LANDS AND SETTLEMENT (Mr. Muturia) (CTD):(d) The land on which these squatters are living is privately owned, and, therefore, the consent of the registered owner is required. If the squatters intend to purchase a portion of that land, they are at liberty to approach the rightful owner on the basis of willing-buyer-willing seller.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KOSKE: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, can the Assistant Minister tell the House the name of the district commissioner who chaired the meeting in which the transaction was actually consented to?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTURIA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, with all the due respect, a district commissioner is not an ordinary person, but an office. So, at that time there was a s district commissioner for that area, who chaired the meeting which transacted this business. If the hon Member knows him since he comes from there he should tell us his name. He did not ask me in his Question the name of the district commissioner who was there at that time.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTISO: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think the Assistant Minister is trying to mislead the House or hide the truth. The hon Member put this question very clearly as follows: ‘Can he tell the House the name of the district commissioner?' We know that the district commissioner is air office; but he has a name. Is he in order to try and evade the truth? Can he come out clearly and say the district commissioner at that time was Mr. so-and-so? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: I think this is a point of order. There is nothing irregular in what the Assistant Minister has said. All he is saying, according to the available information that he has, is that he cannot give the name of the district commissioner now, and that the body of the Question did not require the actual name of the district commissioner who signed the consent forms at that time. So, let us first of all agree that there is nothing irregular in what the Assistant Minister has said, as far as our Standing Orders are concerned. However, hon. Members may, actually, want to know other things from there.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: Arising from that ruling of yours, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and taking into account the reluctance by the Assistant Minister concerned to tell us the name of the district commissioner who was involved in this transaction, because</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU (CTD):district commissioners in this country have names, could he go and find out the name of this particular district commissioner and then give the name to this Souse later on? Probably, he did not expect this supplementary question and that is why he does not have the name with him now.</Newspeech><Newspeech>ME. MUTURIA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, there is no problem with telling the hon Member the name of the district commissioner who was there that year. I can tell him this morning, if he comes to my office. If he comes at 11 o'clock, we will investigate and tell him.</Newspeech><Newspeech>I£R. SHIEDIQJ: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Do we allow such a situation to arise since this Question is the property of the House? The Assistant Minister is telling us to go to his office. He is supposed to answer Questions here and not to ask us to go to his office.</Newspeech><i> (applause) </i> <Newspeech>MR.

MUTURIA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is true that when this pieceof land was being sub-divided, there were no squatters. But as every hon.Member knows, there are squatters in this country and there are instancesespecially in the Coast Province where hon, Mwachofi comes from where squatters are invading peoples land every day. However, this is a question to be dealt with by the administration. We know there are squatters, we know they were there at that time and even now they are there and they will continue to be there. But, there were no squatters in that particular area at the beginning. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KOSKE: Sir, is it really in order for the Assistant Minister to say that there were no squatters then and at the same time to tell us that when the report came later, it was discovered that there were squatters who did not actually come there as new squatters since they were there before? Is it really in order for the Assistant Minister to contradict himself? Can he now tell us what he is going to do with the squatters who were there including this man who bought this land because he was one of the squatters? We know this very well,</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTURIA: Sir? I said that there were no squatters at that particular time. Squatters came later and as every hon. Member knows, there are people without land in this country. Therefore, it is possible that these people came into this land as squatters later on. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OMIDO: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. We are dealing with a very serious matter here. The question of the squatters is a burning issue to some of us. How shall we know who is telling us the truth? The hon. Member-for the area maintains that there were squatters when the land was sold and the Assistant Minister has repeatedly told the House that there were no squatters at that time. Sir, can I have your guidance? How are we going to know the truth because this is not a matter that we can just abandon? The squatter problem is a serious one.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEMER: Well, all what I can say is Easy only indicate what is likely to have happened. It is possible that the squatters were there as being alleged by the hon. Member9 but because of the nature of the transactions in the land sale, there is the other possibility that the buyer who is now the</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER (Ctd.):owner went privately to the original owner and negotiated without the knowledge of those who were. Therefore, at the time when the Land Control Board sat, there was no information that there were squatters on the farm. I suspect that that is the only thing that could have happened although the Assistant Minister did not make that distinction.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTISO: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not know whether your guidance is actually a ruling and if it is9 then could the Assistant Minister withdraw his stand of maintaining that there were no squatters before that land was sold? Those of us who do not come from that area also suspect that they were squatters. The a Assistant Minister is misleading the House. Can he withdraw his remarks?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKERS: Perhaps I did not actually conclude because hon. Omido wanted guidance and I was giving my guidance on the basis of the information that has been given. Perhaps, I should have concluded by asking the Assistant Minister whether he is absolutely sure that there were no squatters at that time. Is that factual or an assumption?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTURIA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, during the transactions. there is a rule laid down to suggest that whoever is a squatter in a particular land or elsewhere in the country must be reported first and registered.</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: Where?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTURIA: Sir, there are offices of the Chief, the District Officers and the District Commissioners. This should have been reported earlier so that we could know the genuine squatters and then deal with them. But as far as we are concerned, there was no squatters in that particular land at that time. Their presence was not reported to us officially.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, arising from your ruling which, I think, every hon. Member here who knows what goes on in this country agrees with it, and taking into account the fact that the hon. Questioner stated that this particular individual was one of the squatters staying there the fellow was just too smart; he managed to get things going on there if it is established that he was not the only squatter on that land, will the Assistant Minister consider revoking or asking the Land Control Board to consider other squatters who were on that land because we cannot take them to Egypt? They must be here, and they are entitled to some living, or to some place. Can he consider that?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTURIA: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, if that person was a squatter as the hon. Shikuku is alleging </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU : No! The hon. Questioner is stating so. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR .MUTURIA: Then that will be dealt with when it is estab¬lished that he was one of the squatters. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Next Question, Mr. Omido.</Newspeech><Header> Question No. 506 </Header> MR. OMIDO asked the Minister for Labour:-(a)	if He-is aware that Ms A.P. & Hall Equitorial Limited of P.O. Box 30663, Nairobi, sacked Mr. Josephat Lihanda on 23rd June, 1986, and have refused to pay him his terminal benefits;(b)	if he is also aware that the employer has ignored ail letters of demand addressed to him by the Ministry and has refused all appeals by the Ministry to attend a meeting to resolve this matter; and(c)	why he has not prosecuted this employer.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. arap Metto): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(a) I am aware that Mr. J. Lihanda who was employed in 1981 as a labourer on casual basis and paid on weekly basis at his own request had his services terminated on 23rd June, 1986, following the</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. arap Metto) (Contd.) :closure of work at the site where he was working. Mr. Lihanda lodgedcomplaint at the Nairobi Labour Office on 26th June, 1986.At a joint meeting held on 13th FEBRUARY. 198? attended by the Financial Director and Operations Manager representing the employer, Mr. Lihanda and the Labour Officer, it was established that Mr. Lihanda was a casual employee working on and off, depending on the availability of work. The employer’s representative, however, agreed to pay Mr. Lihanda as follows:-(a) One month’s wages in lieu of notice – 		Sh. 1,056.90(b) Leave pay for 3 years amounting to 63 days 	 	Sh. 2,219.50Total-	 Sh.3,276.40The total amount of KSh.3,276.40 was paid by the employer, under receipt No.AD.104855 issued on 16th February, 1987.Though not entitled to these payments, Mr. Lihanda still refused to accept them and demanded for severance pay which is not payable where a worker is declared redundant.(b)	No, I am not aware.(c)	I have not considered it necessary to prosecute this employer who has co-operated with my officers and offered to pay Mr. Lihanda more than his legal entitlement which Mr. Lihanda would be better advised to collect.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OMIDO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant- Minister knows very well that under the laws of this country when a worker is a casual worker, he is not entitled to any benefits, whatsoever, leave alone the question of leave. He knows that I have brought Questions into this House very many times about casual workers because they lose their leave days when they are declared redundant. Now, the fact -that the employer has agreed to pay Mr. Lihanda’s three years leave is a confirmation that Mr. Lihanda was not a casual worker but a permanent employee.Secondly, Sir, Mr. Lihanda’s place of work closed down and, </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OMIDO (Contd.):therefore, his work ended because there was no more work for him.This clearly amounts to redundancy. I am sure the Assistant Ministeris aware that his office has signed many letters of dispute. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Omido, will you ask your supplementaryquestion, please? Do not make a speech.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. 0MID0: Yes, Sir. He knows that this Question has beenput to his Ministry and he has signed documents referring redundancycases to the Industrial Court for arbitration. Can the AssistantMinister pursue this matter and make sure that Mr. Lihanda who was,by virtue of what the Assistant Minister has said, a permanentemployee paid some redundancy benefits?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. arap METTO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I was expectingthe hon. Member to appreciate the efforts the Ministry has done intrying to see whether Mr. Lihanda was really a permanent employee ornot. Since the hon. Member is still pursuing the matter. I am advising him that if he has some information or some letters which can assist the Ministry to find ways and means of establishing whether this employee was permanent or casual, it would really help. According to us, we were not able to establish whether Mr. Lihanda was permanent or not. This is why we urged the employer to pay him though we know that he was not entitled to that payment. So, I do not see how my Ministry can pursue this matter further.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OMIDO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, of course, I do appreciate the efforts the Ministry has made. But the fact still remains that that is not enough. The Assistant Minister knows that many workers in this country have no letters of appointment. They are simply covered by agreements signed for or entered into between employers and the various trade unions« This happens to be one of the cases that is involved here. Can the Assistant Minister then produce a document to prove that Mr. Lihanda requested to be placed on casual</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.OMIDO (Contd.):workers basis? He says that Mr. Lihanda requested to be placed on casual workers basis. Can he substantiate that?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. arap METTO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, since this matter has been considered in detail between my Ministry, the employers and the representatives of the employee, I do not think there is any other information that can assist my Ministry to pursue this matter further so that this employee could be retained and confirmed as permanent» He was declared redundant because there was no work for him to do.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. OMIDO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister is saying exactly what I am saying. The employee was declared redundant, and under the laws of this country, the employee is entitledto redundancy pay. The Assistant Minister in his original reply told the House that Mr. Lihanda requested to be placed on casual basis.What I am asking him to do is to substantiate that Mr. Lihanda actually did ask to be a casual worker?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. arap METTO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, according to available information, as I have already stated, this employee was paid on weekly basis. That proves that he was a casual employee.</Newspeech><Header> Question No. 540 </Header> <Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Angatia is not in? NextQuestion. </Newspeech>Question No.116MR.

SHIKOKU (CTD):	We only debate what the Controller and Audi tor-General has reported. V/e do not change figures.

KERIRI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not quite understand what reply the hon. Member wants me to give. I am not saying that figures change. I am far from saying that figures change. I am not saying that they change. How can figures change? How	can Shs. 904,780/- change to anything else?</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. MWACHOEI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, one of theweaknesses of the system within which the Controller and Auditor- General and the Public Accounts Committee operate is that is an	ex-post-facto exercise. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, that is why theGovernment has found it fit to have internal auditors. So, theAssistant Minister should be grateful that questions are being raisedfrom reports of internal audit. Can he tell the House why his	Ministry has repeatedly been hostile to Questions by hon. Shikukuas regards the Kenya Ports Authority? These are Questions which are genuinely based on reports by the internal auditors.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KERIRI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, firstly, I do not	think any one of us has been hostile to hon. Shikuku. We havemerely replied to his Questions. Secondly we are not talking aboutinternal auditors queries. Hon. Shikuku has spoken about theController and Auditor-General's Report and quoted a- case containedin the Report. So, we are not talking about internal auditors queries We are talking about the Controller and Auditor-General's Report. So, I do not understand why hon. Mwachofi should say that we are being hostile to hon. Shikuku.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, arising from that reply and taking into account the Assistant Minister's earlier statement to the effectthat he does not disagree with me about the Controller and Auditor-General's Report assumption on page 21, Could he tell the House and the nation why he stillcomes to this House to tell the nation that this money was properly receivedand spent. Whether We Controller and Auditor-General says that it was irregularlyspent. Whether v/e have debated the Report or not, this does not change the figurequoted here. That figure will not change whether we debate the Report now or in 1990.It will remain the same. Why does the Assistant Minister not tell the nation that this money was irregularly spent as stated by the Controller and Auditor-General? He should tell the nation the truth.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KERIRI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am not saying that I disagreewith hon. Shikuku that this payment was irregular. I agree with hon. Shikukuwhen he says that the Report by the Controller and Auditor-General points outthat the payment was irregular. The Minister did say yesterday that this is not the only matter that is contained in the Controller and Auditor-General's Report. The Report by the Controller and Auditor-General will come here and we shall discuss it and we shall explain all the points raised in it at that time. That is all we are saying.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is it in order for the Assistant Minister to mislead this House by saying that when theController and Auditor-General’s Report comes here, he will explain? Have you	ever heard of anything like that in your life here, Mr. Deputy Speaker? I havenever seen any Minister standing up when we are debating the Public AccountsReport to try and explain anything. Is the Assistant Minister in order to misleadthe House? No Minister ever explains what happens.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KERIRI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I did not say that the Minister will stand up here and explain. There is a procedure to be followed and theHon. Member knows this procedure even better than I do. He knows that the Report by the Public Accounts Committee will be tabled here. The Public Accounts Committee is, a Committee of this House and the hon. Member knows that. Theofficials and everybody else who is concerned will explain that matter in thePublic Accounts Committee before the Report comes here. I am not saying that Iwill stand here and explain it, but there is a procedure to be followed and thehon. Member knows this procedure even better than I do, since he has been herefor many more years than I.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTISO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister agreesthat the money was paid and goods delivered and used. In his Report, theController and Auditor-General queries this matter and says that this particularpurchase of goods was irregular. Did the Minister take any trouble to find out what the Controller and Auditor-General meant by saying that this purchase ofgoods was irregular?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KERIRI: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the answer is "Yes". We are taking trouble to find out why there is a difference in opinion between the Controller and Auditor-General and the management and that is why I am sayingthat the matter will be explained.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Ekidor’s Question.</Newspeech><Header> Question No.534 </Header> MR. EKIDOR asked the Minister for Education:-(a)	whether he could explain how the E.E.C funds (Micro Project) given to Lodwar High Schoolamounting to K.Shs.900,000/- were-spent, and(b)	when the project on this school v/ill be completed.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. Kisiero): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.It is not true that the funds from the European Economic Communitywere given to Lodwar High School direct. These funds were given to the DistrictDevelopment Committee to put up a tuition block and three teachers houses. TheDistrict Development Committee purchased the materials and paid for the servicesrendered. The tuition block is 95 per cent. complete and the teachers houses are85 per cent complete.The answer to part (b) of the question is that on 12th June, 1987,the representatives of the European Economic Community, accompanied by asenior officer of the Ministry of Planning and National Development, visited Lodwar High School and were satisfied with the work already done. It is anticipatedthat construction work will be completed before December, 1987.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EEID0R: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, would the Assistant Ministertell the House out of the Shs.900,000/-, how much money still remains now and where it is? Is it in the bank, at school, with the district development committee or has it been misappropriated?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KISIERO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I said, a small percentageof work still remains to be done and it is obvious that the remaining amount of money is in the form of materials which may have been purchased or which will bepurchased by the District Development Committee. However, in due course, thebuildings should be completed and the money that has not been spent so far willbe spent to complete these buildings.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTISO: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The AssistantMinister has not answered the question. The question is: where is the balanceof the money? Whether the money is in the form of materials or cash, could he tellus whether it is with the District Development Committee or at school?</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. KISIERO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the money is with theDistrict Development Committee. The Government handed the money to the DistrictDevelopment Committee and through the normal system of tendering, the DistrictDevelopment Committee purchased the materials and paid the contractor. So, allthe money has already been handed to the District Development Committee.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The AssistantMinister is not answering the question asked by the hon. Questioner. The hon.Questioner wanted to know how much out of Shs.900,000/-, is still remaining,whether in terms, of cash or materials. We would like to know how much of that money is remaining and where it is. That is the question.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KISIERO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I have said, 95 per cent work on the tuition block is complete and 85 per cent work on the teachers houses is complete. That means only 5 per cent of the work on tuition block is undone and 15 per cent in the case of teachers houses and the balance of the money is in the form of cash or materials which is with the District Development Committee and this money is going to be spent.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we know that the balance ofthe money is in the form of money or materials, but could the Assistant Ministerbe specific enough and tell us how much materials and money is  with the 	District Development Committee. Is he aware that the hon. Member for the area is also a Member of the District Development Committee, and also a member of theSchool Board of Governors? If this money and materials is with the DistrictDevelopment Committee as the Assistant Minister would like us to believe, the hon. Member would have known it. That is why the hon. Member is asking the Assistant Minister to tell us specifically how much material and cash money is remaining and where it is. This is because the hon. Member knows that it is not there.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KISIERO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do, not have a computer type of head to calculate how much of the shs.900.000/= is remaining, shs,900,000/= was the total money made available and 95 per cent of that money has been used on tuition block and 85 per cent on teachers houses. In any case, the buildings in question will be completed with the funds already with the District Development Committee (DDC)<Newspeech>.<Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Are you aware that the Assistant Minister is taking this House for a ride? I am saying this because when we have a question like this one, the Assistant Minister ought to have asked his officers how much materials and how much cash is still left unused. Is he in order to come and tell us that he does not have a computer type of head? We are not asking him to turn his head into a computer. He is supposed to get this information from the field and furnish it to this House.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KISIERO: Mr. Deputy Speaker, I do not know why the hon. Member for Butere is asking for the actual money and material which has remained unused, when I have assured the House that the remaining part of the building will be completed with the funds remaining with the DDC.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, our worry is not about the completion of the buildings but the balance of the money and in what form it is| that is, whether in the form of cash or materials. In view of this, could the Assistant Minister be given more time to look for further information, regarding this matter, because it seems he has not done his homework?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: Mr. Minister, I think the problem here is that the hon. Members want you to answer the question either in monetarymaterial terms. How much of that Kshs.900,000/- can be explained to exist before the actual utilisation in the building. That is all. So it is either you have it or</Newspeech>(applause)<Newspeech>MR.

The Ministry, on further investigations, found it adviceable to install bumps at two other sites, that is, Malava and Lurambi. The installation of bumps on these two centres along the Kakamega-Webuye road is in hand. Bumps have already been installed at Malava and the team is now working at Butali. The whole work is expected to be completed before the end of this month.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, although in the beginning theAssistant Minister had given the impression that he was not going to do anythingabout this matter, I would like to thank him for his reply. Would he not agree withme that it was as a result of this Question being tabled here that they are nowdoing something about Malava? I passed there two weeks back on ray way to KimininiSettlement Scheme and there were no bumps at all. It is actually because of thisquestion that they are now trying to do something about the installation of bumps there.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR, arap KOECH: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not agree with the hon. Member because when the D.D.C. identified these particular sites, there was a need for an investigation to be conducted, after which the work was to commence.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SEIKUKU: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister is relying on the information he gets from his officers in the field. Is he aware that I travelled along that road about a week ago and there was no construction work going on at Malava, or Matete? That is why I am saying that the contention here is that it was only after this Question was tabled that somebody started to make a move. I do not have to deny that they may be doing something there now, but I will be there again this week and I will come back and find out whether the work is not as a result of this Question being tabled here. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. arap KOECH: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I want to assure the hon.

Member may wantus to believe that the work going on there is as a result of the Question. ThisQuestion came up some time ago. So, it was only the question of further investigationsconducted by the Ministry, as I said before, and then the Ministry had to get startedby mobilising itself before the job could be started. However, if the hon. Memberknows of anything that has been delaying the commencement of the work, then he canlet us know so that we can speed up the process. </Newspeech><Newspeech>ME.

Katika Swali hilo, nilikuwa nimeuliza ni kv,ra nini Bw. Stephen Mwaikwasi Mwandime hajalipwa nishahara wake wa Desemba, 1983. Katika. jawabu la Waziri, aliomba msamafia kwamba mshahara huo ulikuwa umechelewa na akaliambia Bunge kwamba Bw.

SHIKOKU: Jambo la nidhamu, Bw. Naibu Spika. Nina mambo kama mawilihivi arabayo nataka kusema hapa. Jambo. la kwanza linahusiana na habari zilizochapishva katika gaseti la Sunday nation la tarehe 13.9.87, ambazo zinatisha a aria. Habari hii inaitusiana na magunia yaliyotoka nje ya nchi hii na kuingizwa humu nchini. Kwa sababu hiyo, wafanyakazi wanaofanya kazi katika kiwanda cha kutengeneza magunia hapa nchini wanakabiliwa na hatari ya kufutwa kazi. Ni kutokaaia na inzxz habari hiyo ambapo ningemtaka Waziri wa Biashara atoe taarifa katika Bunge hili na atueleze kir.aganaga ni kwa nini magunia haya yaliletwa hapa nchini na ni nani aliyefanya hivyo ndipo akaleta shida kwa watu v?etu wakati huu ambako nafasi za kazi ni haba hapa nchini. Hilo ni jambo la kwanza.Jambo la pili, nataka kufuatilia maani yaliyotolewa na mhe. Mwachofi. kwamba Waziri akituahidi kitu katika Bunge hili, tunatumainia kwamba atarudi na kutimisa ahadi yako. Yafaa ahadi ikitolewa iwe ikitimiswa. Kwa mfano, katika Kanuni za Bunge, inasemekana kwamba Waziri akiwasilisha hati katika Bunge, hati hiyo iwe kamilifu. Ninaposema hivyo, nafikiria juu ya hati ya Guarantee of a Loan to the Kenya Ports Authority arabayo inahitajika kuwa na appendix.

Naibu Spika, inaonyesha kwanba Waziri ameleta karatasi yenye taarifa ambayo si kamili. Kwa hivyo tungetaka Waziri aS aeleze ni kwa nini hiyo Appendix haionekani.Pia Bw. Naibu Spika, mnamo tarehe 25.6.87 Waziri wa Biashara Prof. Ng'eno alitoa ahadi katika Bunge hili kwambaBw. Naibu Spika, ningependa kusoma nakili ya taarifa ambayo nimeandika hapa kwa Lugha ya Kiingeresa ili iwe rahisi Id. do go. Mane no hayo ni kaiiia yafuatayoo. "On 25.6.87, the Minister for Commerce, Prof. Ng'eno, in reply to my Question No.96 promised the House that he would lay on the Table of this House a list of companies or firms that had 51 per cent shares held by Africans in clearing and forwarding.Bw. Naibu Spika, Waziri alitoa ahadi hiyo mnamo tarehe 25.6.87. Lakini inaonekana kwamba Waziri anadhani kuwa sisi tumesahau. Hata hivyo kazi ya wengine wetu hapa ni kukaa katika Bunge hili na kuyakumbuka mambo. Waziri hajaitimiza ahadi hiyo. Kwa hivyo ningependa aje atoe taarifa yake hapa na kuitimiza ahadi yake kwa Bunge hili. Hii ni kwa sababu pesa nyingi za IriLgoni zinapelekwa ssk nje ya nchi hii yetu.Tena Bw. Naibu Spika wa muda, tarehe hiyo hiyo ya 25.6.87, na ningependa kunakili kaona ifuatavyo:-"I raised in this House the freedom of movement as provided for under Section 80 of the Kenya Constitution which was being violated by Mr. Chris Kirubi, Manager of International Life House in Mama Ngina Street and sought what steps the Attorney-General was going to take in view of the fact that the said building is a public place with offices open to the general public." <Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU (ctd);Nilimuomba Mkuu wa Sheria aje na kutoa taarifa hapa lakini utaona kwamba mpaka leo hajatoa taarifa yo yote kuhusu jambo hilo.Bw. Naibu Spika, jambo lingine langu la nidhamu ni kama ifuatavyo, and I quote."Hon. Fred Omido, in Question No.396 addressed to the Minister for Labour in connection with a Mr. Peter Maina, an employee of Messrs. Wire Products Limited, was dismissed on 18/3/85 after 15 years of service with the said company. The hon. Member promised to lay on the Table of this House documents proving that Mr. Peter Maina was dismissed on 18/3/85 and not on 18/3/87 as had been stated by hon. Okondo, the Minister for Labour."Bwo Naibu Spika, kulikuwa na, mabishano na mhe. Omido aliahidi kwamba angeleta documents kuonyesha kwamba huyo mtu alifutwa kaai mnamo tarehe l8.3.85 na si l8.3.87 kama vile Waziri alikuwa amedai. Kwa hivyo utaona kwamba jambo hilo halijaletwa katika Bunge hili. Ingefaa mhe. Omido aambiwe kwamba k tunayataka hayo maneno.Jambo lingine la si±kx nidhaaiu, Bw. Naibu Spika, ni kama ifuatavyo. I will quote as follows."On 22.7.87 I stood on a point of order and asked the Minister for Finance to make a Ministerial Statement as to what happened to Sessional Paper No»5 of 1986 which had been laid on the Table of the House last year, 1985? and which/during the seven days period as provided under Section 52 of the Guarantee Loans Act Cap.461, gave notice of a Motion not to guarantee the loan taking into account the fact that the House was prorogued at the end of 1986 and also considering the fact that I renewed my Motion £ early this year. is it not time the Minister for Finance told the House whether the said report was re-laid on the Table of this House and if not what is happening? Is he §s continuing to pay the money?" MR. SHIKUKU (ctd);Bw» Naibu Spika, nilimuomba Waziri wa Fedha atoe raaelezo yake kulihusu jambo hilo. Alipoileta hiyo Guarantee mimi niliipinga. Bunge iliahirishwa na vitu vyote vikafa. Lakini utaona kwamba rn.vaka huu mimi nimependekeza Hoja hapa kuipinga hiyo Guarantee. Nimeangalia katika records zetu na nimegundua kwamba Waziri hajaiweka liiyo Sessional Paper No.5 of 1986 Mezani. Kwa hivyo ningetaka Waziri atueleze kama anazitumia hizo pesa na ni siku gani ambapo ataiweka Taarifa hiyo Mezani. Huenda xkszs ikawa anazitumia hizo pesa; sina uhakika. Lakini ningependa Waziri atoe taarifa katika Bunge hili na kueleza ni kwa nini yeye hajayafanya mambo hayo.Pia Bw. Naibu Spika, nikiwa katika jambo langu lamisho la nidhamu; nilimtaka Mkuu wa Sheria  aeleze nisheria gani ambayo inampa assistant chief au chief uwezo wakuchukua kuku, meza, sahani, mbuzi na kadhalika kut'oka kwawananchi wakishindwa kutoa michango ya Harambee. Mkuu wa Sheriaaliahidi kwamba atakuja kutoa taarifa hapa Bungeni lakini mpakasasa hajafanya cho shee chote. Nina mengi ya kusema lakiniwakati hautoshi. Hii inaonyesha kwamba Bunge hili sasa halipewiheshima. Huu ni £ mfano tu. Kama Mawaziri wanatoa 3aa ahadi katikaBunge hili ni lazima i wazitimize ahadi hizo. Hii hi teasababu heshima ya Bunge liili itashushwa chini ikiwa tunapewaahadi na Mawaz. ambazo hazitimizwi. Mtindo kama huo uki endeleaBunge hili halitakuwa na maana. Yafaa vile vile ifahainike kwambawatu wa Seevsxsixs Kenya hutoa pesa nyingi kama kodi ili kutuwekakatika Bunge hili. Kiva hivyo ni lazima heshima ya Bunge hili idumishwe. Kwa hivyo ni. lazima Mawaziri na Wabunge wenginekama vile mhe. Omido wafahamu kwamba wakitoa ahadi katika Bungehili ni lazima wazitimize kwa sababu Bunge hili. ni izsiiHsh la heshima.

I do not have</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: No, we do not go to the nextMotion; we go to the next speaker Mr. Khalif.</Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. KHALIF: Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute on this very important  Motion. This Motion is calling for more irrigation activities using the waters of River Engare Uaso Nyiro.  But Mr. Deputy  Speaker, Sir, I stand to oppose this Motion, I know that it is unusual for Back-benchers to oppose Motions which are  introduced into this House by their colleagues But I do oppose this Motion because it is not in the interests of my people;  the people of Wajir District and North Eastern Province as a whole The Motion is calling for more irrigation on the upper  parts of River Ess Engare Uaso Njriro. I say this because just about 15 years ago this river used to flow naturally to wajir  and Garissa districts.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, you will now find that because of excessive irrigation on the upper course of the River, the River  has gone underground.We have introduced Motions in this House urging the Government to stop excessive irrigation on this  River because excessive irrigation has caused the river to go  underground in some parts of North Eastern Province. I believe  that there are laws governing the regulation and use of water resources in this country.GGN	K.l… 7.10.87</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KHALIF (Ctd.):These laws take, into account the interests of all the peopleliving in the North Eastern Province. The people of NorthEastern Province particularly those living in Wajir Districthave been denied the right of the only river they have in theNorth Eastern Province. I remember some 15 years ago as a youngman I used to swim in that river, our livestock used to drinkwater from that river and we used to do some small-scaleirrigation farms along the course of that river, but thatis no more, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The people livingin Wajir District have been denied the use only river they have ever seen since the world began. This is because for the last  15 years, there has been excessive and uncontrolled irrigation in the upper course of this river. Even in international law,  countries using the resources of a certain river have to use them in a manner that every other country continues to depend on  that river. For example, River Nile passes through various countries in Eastern Africa - Uganda, Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt.  If Egypt was denied the use of that river because of some excessive us by these other countries, Egypt would have the right  to go to war with those other countries because of being denied the use of that river. By the same token, people in the North  Eastern Province end particularly Wajir District have been denied the water God has given  them. They have for centuries and  centuries used that river and because of this excessive irrigation which has been taking place for the last 15 years, the  river has suddenly gone underground. We want the government to use some money to re-open the course of this river. This is  possible because investigations and studies have been done by experts show that is possible, if this excessive irrigation  will ston and if some money is used,</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KHALIF (Ctd.):It is possible to re-open the natural course of this river so that it flows naturally through Wajir District and those other  districts.As you know, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, Wajir Districttotally depends on underground water have no source ofsurface water we have no lakes, no rivers or other sources ofsurface water. All we depend on is underground water and thatunderground water supply is becoming more scarce because ofthe growing population and the extensive use of bore holes.We are digging bore holes everywhere and as we continue toexploit the sources of underground water, the supply grows lessand less. So, there is a possibility that this district willat one time experience a kind of very rapid desertification if do not stop this type of desertification that is going on now.With no surface water and very limited amount of money, we use.underground water and with the growing population of animalsand human beings, the district is over-used by human beings andby animals. Vegetation is also dying out and there are allsigns that this district is going to be clear of all this natural vegetation forests and Shrubs there are.So, water resource for us is extreemly important as it is to all human beings and most important, for people who have no  water resource at all. It is in this line that we would like to appeal to the Kenya Government to stop excessive irrigation  projects in River Engare Uaso Nyiro and to do everything possible to re-open the natural course of the. river. It is  possible; studies have shown it, and experts have said so and the draft of the studies is available in the Ministry ofK.3 … 7.10.87</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KHALIF (Ctd):Agriculture with the Water Control Board and the Government should use money to re-open the course of this river sc that also  the people in Wajir District and other parts of North Eastern Province can have their undeniable right to use this river  again.With those few remarks, Mr. Deputy Speaker Sir, I beg to oppose the Motion.KKD	L.l - 7.IO.87</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KELIKU: Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. This isa very important Motion because this country has been experiencing famine allthe time. I think the Government should have a national policy making itpossible for all dry areas in the country to have irrigation. This countryis blessed with rivers, lakes and mountains. We have water resources, andwhat we lack are committed people. People are not committed enough. Wehave short-sighted officers who do not plan for irrigation in this country.It is very shameful, when we nave such big rivers and lakes, to have famine all the time. Our people are short of food all the time. As we are nowSpeaking here, the rains are just about to start falling. When it rains, youcan get water everywhere in this country, but after a very short time youfind every place dry because we do not plan to arrest that water. Most ofthe water in this country flows to the Indian Ocean because we do not have thepeople who can arrest that water. The most important thing to do is to arrest rain water, instead of leaving it to flow to  the Indian Ocean. However, moneymust be allocated for irrigation using such rivers as the Uaso Nyiro and othersThe problem we have is that we are not now doing anything nor making any plans.We only plan when we have drought, but when it rains and water is there weshould do something about it. Why have we continued to have water problemsover 24 years since attaning our Independence? We have water, and the Ministry of WaterDevelopment has even promis	ed that by the year 2000, everyone is going to haveWater. How serious the Ministry is in this promise, I do not know. It is nowhigh time the Ministry of water Development went round and did something,, TheMinistry of Energy and Regional Development particularly should not just waitfor Members of Parliament to move Motions in this House and awaken them to theimportance of national policies. It is very little money that	used toarrest this water and make vise of it, instead of letting it go down to the Indian Ocean Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I know that the Ministers for Water Development and Energy and Regional Development arc not here now  .The one problem we have is that when we are discussing very important Motions likeL.2 – 7.10.87</Newspeech><Newspeech>MB. KILDOJ (CTD.):	this one, the Ministers concerned, are not in the House to listen to and take down the points raised Hon. Members of  Parliament, know the problem that the people experience in rural areas as well as in urban areas. I think irrigation is doing  very well especially in Garicsa. I have seen the irrigation which is now going on there, Garissa has been a very day area,  but if you go there now you will get every type of food. Why can the same thing not be extended, to other dry areas in the  country and enable everybody to have sufficient food? When we do not have sufficient food for ourselves, we cannot convince  our people that the Government is doing something for them becausefood is the most basic need of a human beings. I If we can built an oil pipeline for Shs.600 million from Mombasa to Nairobi,  how is that we cannot have a water pipeline from Lake Victoria and other lakes to where the people are? This latter pipeline  cannot cost Shs.600 million as has been the case with the oil pipelines Let us be ourselves and give our people  water,Irrigation is our only p solution to the famine problem in this country, Water is the only solution towards having  sufficient food in this country, and without water, although we can have other developments, we cannot achieve mucho "e  should have enough water for drinking and irrigation. At the same time, we should teach our people to practise crop  diversificaticon. Some people do not know what crops they should plant in a specific place. It is for the Ministry to tell  them the kind of crop they can grow-in a given place, according to the climate of the place. I call upon Government officers  to be more committed and have a national irrigation policy, not only for some areas, but for all areas of this country  especially the dry areas where people suffer from water shortages.With those few points, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support,</Newspeech><Newspeech>TEE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CGKMERCE (Mr. Lalampaa): Asante Sana, Bw.

It is important to considsr our priorities for our livelihood^ whether it is irrigation or water for human  consumption.When you look at areas like NyeriEND M. …LNN		N.1....7.1O.07</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTHURA: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I am wondering whether hon. Mutiso and hon. Lalampaa are opposing  the Motion in its original form or in the amended form. The Motion was amended by the Minister and one of the conditions of  amending it was that the hon. Members would accept it after it had been amended.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER: What is before the House now, and it is clear in the Order Paper, is the amended Motion, but that does  not preclude any hon. Member from taking any stand.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTISO: Thank you Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I amnot opposing the Motion. If the hon. Member would have been patientenough, he would have seen what I wanted to say. In fact, I onlysupported the idea advanced by the last speaker because I think itis also important to say that irrigation must be controlled. I am saying, this because if you let water to be used anyhow  Actually, water is our life and if there are some people downstream who require water from a river but they cannot get it  because it is being used excessively upstream, then we would be doing them a lot of disservice. This is why I was supporting  the idea advanced by my friend, hon. lalampaa, the Assistant Minister for Commerce.Since the hon. Member comes from the area, he knows the state of the River Uaso Nyiro. I have never been there myself so I do  not know about it. But I am saddened by what he said that the river is drying. If the water level is going lower and lower  because of excessive irrigation upstream, then that is why I 33 was saying that there must be control of that kind of  irrigation so that the people downstream can continue to benefit and live by the grace of God given by that water of the  River Uaso Nyiro.Further more, Mr. -Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me say that it is also important for the Minister who moved the amendmentN.2	7.10.87</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTISO (ctd.):To even have considered this point that if the River EngareUago Nyiro goes underground at a 35 certain point, whereas we need that water, that must not be allowed to happen. We have  modern technology whereby we can arrest that water and save it from going underground. We should not let that water get  wasted by going underground and ending up into the Indian Ocean. The people of the area at which point the river goes  underground,need that water very much Therefore, the Minister should have considered the possibility of building a dam  upstream before the point at which the river goes underground so that there can be a reservoir from which the people who do  not get this water can he served. It would even have been better to create an artificial surface river to feed the people who  do not get the water from this river Letting this water go underground century after century means that we are not using our  brains to the maximum.So, I was suggesting that since wananchi, live stock and other creatures need this water it should not be allowed to go  underground. This is the question I was putting to the Minister so that he should see the possibility of saving this water  from being wasted. When it goes underground, nobody is using it and yet there are people who badly need that water which is  being wasted. So, while I support the Minister's wish of continuing to support the irrigation projects in the districts  mentioned in the Motion, he should also consider the possibility of making sure that he tames that water instead of letting  it get wasted by going underground, even if it means looking for money from somewhere. An artificial river could be made to  cater for those people do not receive water from this river. This is happening elsewhere in the world whereby rivers have  been diverted completely from their original courses for some other useful purposes. I am sure that this could also be done  with the River Engare Uaso Nyiro. This is the point IN.3....7.10.87</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTISO (ctd.):wanted to advance and my hon. friend, hon. Muthura should not think that I am opposing the Motion for the mere reason that I  said that irrigation should he controlled. This is Important. Anything left without any consideration or proper arrangement  can he misused. That is why I was saying that irrigation upstream should be controlled so that the people downstream are not  punished by excessive irrigation in the districts from which the river originates. with these few remarks, I support the  Motion. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MICKOMA: Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to contribute to this very important Motion. I have listened  very carefully to my hon. colleague who contributed to this Motion s before me.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, first and foremost, I would like to thank the Mover of this Motion. We now have the District Focus  for Rural Development Strategy but I would like to say that most of the officers in the Ministries have not been vigilant  they have not been serious about the development of this country. The idea behind having the District Pocus for Rural  Development Strategy was so that development could be spread to those areas which had been neglected by the colonialists.I remember one time hon. Adichareh, who is seated in front of me,saying that the Ministry of Energy and Regional Development  should develop semi-arid areas so that all wananchi throughout Kenya can see that they are one people as per the Constitution  of this country and so that they could see that they sire not discriminated against. I also take serious note of the  sentiments expressed by hon. Khalif and hon. Lalampaa, the Assistant Minister for Commerce.[Mr. Deputy Speaker left the Chair][The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mutiso) took the Chair]ANO	0...1 7.10.87</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MICHOMA (ctd):Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Government should also ensure that that part of the country is developed. X support  the Motion as amended and I would like to suggest that money should be obtained from elsewhere to enable wananchi to get  water for their domestic consumption and for use by their animals. This water should be used for irrigation in order to  develop that area.In view of the fact that this country should have enough food for home consumption and for export, I think we have not  adhered to Sessional Paper Ho. 4 on food policy which was passed by this House. This also applies to Sessional Paper Ho. 1 of  1986 which says that we should treble food pro¬duction by the year 2000. This has also not been taken seriously. I would like  to suggest that the Ministry of Water Development, the Ministry of Energy and Regional Development and the Ministry of  Agriculture should join hands to ensure that irrigation is spread throughout the country where it is needed. In this way, we  will have more food for home consumption and for export.The other point which I would like to raise is that we have been told time and again in this House that it is a policy of the  Government that the Ministry of Water Development will provide piped water to every home by the year 2000. I do not think  that this will work, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. This is because water projects which have been given priority by the  district development committees, are not implemented. It is the duty of all Ministers to ensure that all projects approved by  the district development committees are implemented if funds are available.The loans granted to this country from abroad should be used to	jaccelerate development throughout the country and especially in the Horth Eastern Province and part of Eastern Province and  such areas as Isiolo and Samburu in the Rift Valley Province and so on. This should also apply to parts of Kyanza Province.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

The water level of that river has gone down tremendously and it is not even more than 2  feet deep. Can you imagine that, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir? How can irrigation be undertaken by using that kind of  rater level?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MICHOMA: I thank the hon. Assistant Minister for that information, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I would like to  support hon. Mutiso when he said earlier that engineers from the Ministry of Water Development should go to that area and  find ways and means of getting that water to where the people live.</Newspeech><Newspeech>AIT HON. MEMBER: The water is not there.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MICHOMA: If the water is not there, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,Sir, boreholes should be sunk in that area so that wananchi can also have waterfor their home consumption. Water for home consumption should be given first priority instead of irrigation.With these few remarks, I beg to support the Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Khasalchala): Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for  allowing me to say a few words about this Motion. This Motion, as it stands, is very important and it is within the policy of  the African region where people want to have enough food to feed the nations.It was only last week, during the Nairobi International Show, when the two Heads Of State from Zambia and Kenya shewed great  concern about the drought in Africa which causes food shortage.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. GAIGALLO: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.0...3 7.10.87</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING(Mr. Khasakhala): Do not cut me short before you know what I am  talking about.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. GALGALLO: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister in order to insinuate that  food production refers only to crop production? This is because even livestock produce food and they depend on the water from  this river to quench their thirst and also its water is used to irrigate grass. Is he in order to suggest that irrigation can  only provide us with crop production?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCAST DIG (Mr. Khasakhala): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon.Member jumped on his feet before he even understood what I was going to say. What  I am saying that the principles of irrigation are within our planning in the whole of Africa. This is because we want to  produce enough food to feed the nation. We cannot depend on rains which fall from time to time. I was referring to the  statements which were issued by the two Heads of State last week during the Nairobi International Show. The two leaders were  very much concerned about food shortage in Africa.We can only combat the food shortage by undertaking irrigation. By saying this, I am not trying to say that the people in the  lower part of Engare Uaso Nyiro should not get water. I have certain proposals which I was going to make. These proposals are  going to bring conflicts in this Motion. The first proposal is that as much as we would like to use the water from this river  for irrigation, we must also consider people living in the lower areas where water is a necessity. I was going to suggest  that thin Motion should be looked at broadly; it should not be looked at narrowly as we are doing at the moment. Many hon.  Members are looking at irrigation by using the water from the source only without putting into consideration the technical  knowledge of irrigationWhat is important in this Motion is for the Ministry of Water Development to be concerned with the source of the water so  that it can increase the amount of water from the source, by constructing a dam.We need storage at the source so that this water can be stored somewhere before it is let to flow downwards. We should also  construct another dam0	4 7.10.87</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORFlATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Khasakhala) Ctd:at the lower level so that water does not disappear into the ground. The water should flow easily from the dam where the  water is stored for irrigation and also from another dam which supplies water to the lower parts of the country where it  flows. As hon. Members from that lower parts of the country have indicated that the river is now drying up, I would like to  say that it is not only that river which is drying up. At present, water levels in most of our rivers have gone down because  of the misuse of the river banks. We have allowed most of our river banks to be misued; people are farming very close to the  fivers. That is why the water level in the Engare Uaso Nyiro River is going down. If we can restrict people from misusing the  river banks, we shall have enough water from the source.Right now, Sir, there are so many illegal irrigations being under-taken without guidelines. Someone just decides to divert water from a river for irrigationto Ma shamba without consultation with the Ministry of Water Development.KKD	P.l - 7.10.87</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. KhasakhaIa)(Ctd.): We have a regulation in the Ministry of  Agriculture and the Ministry of Water Development which restricts any person from interfering with water sources and river  banks. Using irrigation illegally is prohibited, and we would call upon the Ministry of Water Development to see to it that  this particular river is carefully studied and restricted so chat its water is used by all. We do not want the people living  on the lower parts of the river and their animals to suffer for lack of drinking and cooking water .due to illegal irrigation  at the source of the river. There is illegal irrigation going on at the source of the river which is not done according to  plan. This is what is causing the shortage of water down the river. If we, as a Government, go to the source of River Engare  Uaso Nyiro and find out whit exactly has stopped the river flowing as it used to, ire will be able to get enough, rivers from  the hills where this river originate The river basin has not been intefered with, but the flow of water has. The basinof this river is right on the hills, and these hills are still intact as theyhave not been interfered with0 However, after the water comes out of the riverbasin and starts flowing downwards, just before it disappears, I am afraid tosay illegal irrigation tampers with itTherefore, as has been proposed in this Motion, the Government should study carefully how this irrigation may not interfere  with the free flow of this water. It should build dams so that people living in the lower parts of the river may get water.  So this Nation as amended is very clear. It states very clearly, “in assisting in harnessing the water of the River Engare  Uaso Nyiro for irrigation purposes" something should be done. Sos the Government is looking into these problems as well. It  knows that water disappears underground and that it is going to look into this possibility of assisting irrigatior both in  the upper and the lower parts of the river so that no one suffers from the lack of water. So Members should not look at the  Motion as though the Government wants to use all the water for irrigation in the upper parts. It will look into building dams  both in the upper and the lower parts of the river so that all the people there do not suffer from the lack of water at all.  It is easy for rivers P.2  7.10.87</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (Mr. Khasakhala)(Ctrl. ): to dry up. By the way we are allowing our  river banks to be interfered with^ and the way we are planting trees and farming very close to rivers, I am afraid we are  going to interfere with most rivers in the country. In the long run we might find that the country is becoming drier and  drier. I think we should build dams and store more water there for irrigation and other major uses.With these few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the amendment.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. QMAMO: Thank you, Mr. temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute to the Motion. Having  listened carefully to what my colleagues have said, I think it is fair to point out that this Motion draws our attention to  two aspects about this river which should be carefully looked into. We should separate these two aspects. Firstly, there is  the Engare Uaso Nyiro as a river. How does it behave during different times of the year? Where does it start and where does  it flow? How does it disappear? Why should Uaso Nyiro River disappear? What has happened? Has the flow of the river cracked?  Why has the river disappeared? Where has it gone to?</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: It has gone underground,</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. CMAMO: If it has gone underground, can it not be followed? The relevant technology to do this is available0 Can the river  not be followed underground to find cut where it is? How deep is it? Is it salty? If it is salty, how salty is it? That is  one aspect which is important for the House to look into. The Government should take hold of Uaso Nyiro River as such and see  how it behaves. I quite agree with the Assistant Minister, hon. Khasakhala, when he says that we should not forget what is  happening up the river. Something may be happening up the river which is interfering with the river downstream. I myself  believe that there is a need to improve the catchment area of Uaso Nyiro River in order to enable it to catch as much a water  as possible. We can do this by improving the river banks,river valleys and the forest edge.The second aspect which I think is important here is the utilisation. P.3 – 7.10.87</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. CUAMO (CTD.):of the water of Uaso Nyiro River. No one would like to see Uaso Nyiro River just like a picture without its being utilised.  It is the utilisation of this water that should be rationalised, Surely, it would be very unfair for the water in this river  to be overused upstream while people downstream starve. This is not allowed. The people downstream always complain if those  upstream are utilising more of a certain river's water than they actually should. I would like to share the sentiments  expressed in the Motion that there is a need to harness the water that is in Uaso Nyiro River for irrigationIrrigation is only one use of water. We realise that, apart from irrigation,water should be used by human beings, livestock, grass and ether living creatorWe do not only live with other human beings and livestock. There are otherliving things in the ecosystem which should not be disturbed, includingwildlife. Even wildlife have a right to live here in Kenya. They live on earth and the earth is the only place with life as  we know. Wildlife has a right to stay here and so have the spiders living along the river. The same applies to other insects  and bacteria living along the river. Utilisation of this water is important.It is true, as hon. Khasakhala mentioned, that irrigation for agricultural purposes is a must as we approach the year 2000.  In a country like Kenya, and other countries that have agriculture as the backbone of the economy, it is known that rain-fed  agriculture cannot do better than the rainfall itselfART		Q. 1 – 7.l0.87</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. OMAMO (Contdo):How can rain-fed agriculture be better than the irrigated agriculture? I can see my good friend, the Assistant Minister for  Agriculture, is looking at me and smiling. This is true. Rain-fed agriculture cannot do better than the irrigated agriculture  because when the rainfall coines late, the rain-fed agriculture is late. To help production, irrigation must come in. So,  utilisation of Engare Uaso Nyiro River, as a source of irrigation if there is enough water, is commendable.I do share the. feelings of ray good friend, hon. Lalampaa, who points cut that, as we are talking now, the level of the  water in the Engare Uaso Nyiro River is very lows It is not the fault of the water in the river. No I The water in the Engare  Uaso Nyiro River has to be helped to cone up0 But the idea of using river water for irrigation is an excellent idea, and it  should be practised in our country.What applies to Engare Uaso Nyiro River would also apply to other	Rivers. I am sure my friend, and the House, would appreciate that utilising river water for irrigation is a lot more cheaper  than waiting for this river to get .into a lake like Victoria and then try to pump it out. It costs much more to pump the  water from the river back. It is cheaper to harness it before it goes too low downs Harnessing the Engare Uaso Nyiro River,  just like harnessing theAthi or Tana River upstream, is a lot more cheaper than waiting forthis river to go further down and then pump the water upcountry.Sir, I would like to, support this lotion very, very strongly,and use the occasion also to thank the Mover for bringing it up, andso helping us to focus on water from the rivers for irrigation andother agricultural uses here in the country. Thank you, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Mutiso): There are only two minutes left before the Hover responds. <Newspeech>Q. 2 – 7.10.87<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENERGY AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT(Mr. Adichareh): Ahsante sana, Bw.

MUTHURA : Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, before I reply, I would like to give five minutes to hon. Dr. Chibule.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. CHIBULE: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank the Mover for giving me five minutes to support the Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR, CIHBULE (Contd.) :							Q.3  7.10.87Sir, a lot has been said about the Motion, but at one stage an attempt was made to try to misunderstand or misinterpret the  inten¬tions of the mover and the intentions of the Motion. The intention: of the Mover and the Motion was not to deny some  herdsmen water for their livestock, or to deny wananchi water for use. The intention of the Motion is to harness the use of  water.According to the information I have which is the current information now Engare Uaso Nyiro River is a river that flows, and  when it reaches at a certain stage, it disappears under the ground. Things might have changed now as we are told. It has also  been said that we shall investigate to know the current situation. But accord¬ing to our information, there was some water of  the Engare Uaso Nyiro that was disappearing under the ground. It is this water that was disappearing under the ground,  according to the Mover of the Motion and I agree with him, that was going to waste.It is our duty to make use of that water.  I think that point should be made clear.Sir, the Motion has reminded us once again the importance of agriculture and also the importance of irrigation. I wish to  tell this House that there has been a phenomenon called "The Green Revolution". This means that the countries that were not  self-sufficient in food were able to produce so much food that they had to exports For instance, Mexico was one of them, and  India was another one. In all instances of "The Green Revolution", there has always been irrigation, and without irrigation,  Kenya cannot have "green revolution".Sir, Kenya has made advances in development through the Harainbee spirit. As a result of the Harambee spirit we have got many  schools that we would not have had. We also have got a lot of health institutions that would not have been there. Irrigation  is something that is going to kill two birds with one stone. It is going to provide food for the country, and it is also  going to provide jobs for the wananchi. We have those two problems. We are not yet self-sufficient</Newspeech><Newspeech>DR. CHIBULE (Contdo):					Q.4  7.10.87in food, and we have also got high unemployment I think a stage hasreached when we should put the Harambee spirit into starting irrigationproject So When the water is flowing from the western escarpment toLake Victoria, it floods the Nyando Plains. Through the Harambee spiritwe can build dams to arrest the floods. Because a lot of water which we need is already in Lake Victoria, we can build that  pipe of water, not of oil, from Lake Victoria tO the western escarpment near Turkana where the land is vast and dry and do  need irrigation.Sir, with those few remarks, I hand over the ball to the Mover.</Newspeech><Newspeech>	MR. MUTHURA: Thank you very much, Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker.May I start by thanking all the hon. Members who have aired their views onthis Motion and from what has been said here, we all understand that there is need for irrigation. Let us for a moment forget  about River Engare Uaso Nyiro,Tana River and all these other rivers. There is great need for irrigationby using every available water in the Republic. Mr. Deputy Speaker, s Sir, let me thank the Minister for Energy and Regional  Development for amending the Motion and accepting its concept. However, I would like to say one thing here that the original  idea of this Motion was not to deny the people of Sanburu, Marsabit and others in the lower areas through which this river  flows, the water from this river. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir,when the Minister ruled out the question of establishing an  authority for that particular river, he pointed out that what was being requested in the Motion, would be done by the Tana  and AthiRivers Development Authorities.		Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, before water is put into use for irrigation, Ibelieve experts from the Ministry of Water Development, will study the source and course of this river and they will tell us  the reason why they think that this wateris not enough before they allow the irrigation scheme to start. I believe thatthe idea which was brought up by hon. Khasakhala of building a dam,so that wecan collect as much water as possible, is one of the ideas. that these experts	would come up with. So, the idea is not deny the people in the lower areasthrough which this river flows, the water they need. Mr.Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to make a little correction here.  The fact that this river originate! from Nyandarua mountains does not mean that the river passes through Nyandarua District.  Although the river originates from Nyandarua mountains, it flows towards the Nyeri side of the mountains and then flows  through Nyeri District, Laikipia District, Samburu and so on. I understand the geography of that whole</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTHURA (Ctd.):	R.2.  7.10.87.area and as far as I know there is only one person in my constituency who uses the water from this river for irrigation and  that is the person who owns murera Farm. This person has irrigated less than 50 acres of land with the water from this river.  So, I would like to appeal to the Minister for Water Development to look into the problems that would arise as a result of  using the water from this river for irrigation, and get a solution to them so that this water does not just go and get lost  somewhere in the North-EasternProvince,as we have known it to be the case. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the whole idea here is to start an irrigation scheme here. We have a lot of water in this country  which flows into the IndianOcean but with the experts in the Ministry of Agriculture who have attained wideexperience in technology from within the country and from overseas, I believe,we shall be able to get enough water for irrigation and therefore, be self-sufficient in food production? both for home consumption and for export which will give us extra foreign exchange  which we need so much.With those few remarks, I beg to move.(Question of the Motion as amended put and agreed to) Resolved accordinglyTHAT, considering the fact that River Engare Uaso Nyiro,which originates in Nyandarua mountains and flows through Nyeri,  Laikipia, Samburu and Isiolo District before going underground somewhere in North Eastern Province, is not adequately put to  use in the said Districts for irrigation; this House urges the Government to assist in harnessing the waters of River Engare  Uaso Nyiro for irrigation purposes.</Newspeech><Header> MOTION</Header> 					<Newspeech>MR. KISUYA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker Sir, I beg to move the following Motion:-THAT, considering the fact that it is our Government's declared policy to eliminate poverty amongst our people through  increased agricultural production of cash and food crops; and noting that to succeed in this endeavour as much arable land as	 possible need to be put under proper cultivation? this House urges the Government to introduce plantation of tea and  pyrethrum into all appropriate areas, particularly those which are 4500 feet above sea level on the slopes of Mt. Elgon in  Bungoma District.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker. Sir," I know it is the Governmentspolicy since the attainment of our Independence, to fight against povertyamongst our he own people in this country. It is also the Government’s policyto improve the social and economic standards of the people, in this country.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker. Sir. we cannot do anything without the Government’ssupport and we would like to call upon the Government to introduce the growingof such cash crops which can fetch more money 0 to enable our own people to earn their own living.Cash crops are very important indeed. They bring in a lot of money9 not only to an individual, but also to the country  Poverty amongst our own people is a very bad thing indeed and every parson hates poverty. People steal because they do not  have money? people steal because they do not have food to eat. Poor people cannot go overseas to enjoy themselves^ neither go  for holidays nor afford to buy proper clothings for themselves or even pay school fees for their children if they are poor©  It is the responsibility of our Government a to assist poor people® The poor people are working very hard and they have  planted a lot of cash crops like coffee, tea pyTethrum, cotton and so on so as to improve their own living.END R</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KTSUYA (ctd.):Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I know very well that God has said that people must eat from their sweat. Bungoma people  are amongst the very hard working people of Kenya. In fact, Bungoma District itself is a granary of Kenya although the  Bungoma people had been forgotten by the colonial government. If the citizens of Bungoma live 4,500 feet above sea level and  have very fertile volcanic soil suitable for growing tea and pyrethrum, why did the Europeans forget them? The climate of  Bungoma is very good. If you know about Kericho, that area falls within the Lake Basin. Kakamega District, which is very  suitable for growing tea also falls within the Lake Basin region. Kitale District, which ga also grows a lot of tea, falls  within the same region, Why were the people of Bungoma, who live in the slopes of the mountain, forgotten when the planting  of these cash crops like tea and pyrethrum was introduced? I am asking the Government, and the Ministry of Agriculture in  particular, to grant authority to those people who live in areas such as Togoren Division in the former White Highlands to  plant cash crops such as tea and pyrethrum. The second lot which I am asking the Government to grant authority to plant these  crops is that of the people living North of the road running from Kitale entering Bungoma through Kamukuywa, Kimilili,  Chwele, Sirisia, Malakisi and Chepkube which lies down to the border of Kenya and Uganda. All these areas north of this road,  running from Kitale to Bungoma are about 4,500 feet above sea level I do not, therefore, see the reason why the people who  live in those areas should not be allowed to plant these cash crops along with the crops they are already growing like  tobacco and what have you. I would like to request the Government, through the Assistant Minister for Agriculture who is  listening here, to automatically give permission to the Kenya Tea Development Authority to allow my people in Bungoma and  elsewhere in the Republic of Kenya to plant tea and pyrethrum in those places where the exercise is suitable.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, before I go further, and with yourpermission, I would like to quote from the Bible what Gad has said to the people of this world. In the Book of Ecclesiastics,  Chapter 5 verse 18, God says:-</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KISUYA (ctd.):		S.2  7.10.87"Behold that which I have seen it is good for one to eat, and to drink and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh  under the sun all the days of his life which God has given him for it is his portion".Sir, while my hon. friend here, hon. Lalampaa, lives, he needs to eat, to drink and to enjoy himself.</Newspeech><Header> QUORUM </Header> <Newspeech>MR. ABUYA-ABUYA: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.I just wanted to draw to the attention of the Chair that there is no Quorum. We are only 10 in the House.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER(Mr, Mutiso): Okay, ring the Division Bell. (The Division Bell was rung)</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr.Mutiso): Order, we have a Quorum now. You may continue, Mr. Kisuya.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KESUYA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is a verse in the Bible which says that every person, who is descended  from Adam is entitled to eat, drink and sleep very well and enjoy life.All these areas on the slopes of Mount Elgon, where  Nyayo Tea Zones have been established, are very good. I am happy to note that the Government has started to establish Nyayo  ESs Tea Zones on the slopes of Mt. Elgon.If the Government accepts this Motion we will start planting tea and pyrethrum on  the slopes of Mt.Elgon and this will boost the economy of this this country.Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, you will find thatthe tea industry is the second largest industry in this country, the largest being coffee industry. Tea is number two foreign  exchange earner for this country. I would like to give some comparisons here During the year 1924 the White Farmers in this  country harvested about 480 kilogrammes of tea leaves.In 1963 those same White farmers produced 18 million kilogrammes of tea  leaves. After Independence when Africans had been authorised to plant tea this country produced 56.5 million kilogrammes of  tea leaves. In 1924 this country produced only 480 kilogrammes of tea leaves but you will find that by 1973 the country was  able to produce 56.5 million kilogrammes of tea leavesIn 1986 alone this country produced more than 143 million kilogrammes of tea leaves. About 116 million kilogra¬mmes of tea  were exported to other countries. This earned this country EShs.3.5 billion.The balance of 17.7 million kilogrammes of tea  was sold locally and farmers here earned more than KShSo'266 million. You can see that the Government earns a lot of</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KISUYA(ctd);			money from tea. You will find that EShs.3.5 billion is a lot of money. The farmers themselves earned KShs.266 million and  this went into their pockets. Therefore,I feel that the tea industry is very important and the people of Bungoma are  demanding their right to start planting tea and pyrethrum. This is because they have very good soil.Why can they not be  allowed to grow this cash crop so that they can enjoy its benefits like the people in Nandi and Kericho districts and other  parts of the country?. So, all the people living in appropriate areas in Bungoma and £££h± Kitale should be allowed to plant  tea and pyrethrum.If we plant more tea we will build more industries. Also by building more industries we will employ more  people. All those university graduates, Form IV ana Form VI leavers who are looking for employment will get jobs in this  industry. There is no doubt that if we are allowed to grow tea and pyrethrum in all those appropriate areas in Bungoma, on  the slopes of Mt. Elgon, we will employ casual workers. They will be working in the farms and they will be able to earn a  living. We will also have permanent employees.They will also be earning a living. So, these people will be able to pay school  fees for their own children.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, with the introduction of the District Focus for Sural Development Strategy every project  has to be approved by the district development committee. I believe that Harambee contributions are playing a major role in  the development of this country. No district can start an health centreor a clinic unless the people there are able  contribute money towards the implementation of such projects. They cannot even  build social halls where they can go and entertain themselves With the introduction of the new 8-4-4 system of education in  this country we are required to build workshops. I believe that if factories are started in Bungoma, the people of Bungoma  will find it very easy to pat up some workshops in primaryMr. KISUYA (ctd.)				schools and secondary schools so that at least our own young men and women can learn some trades. Those who cannot continue  with their education can use what they have learnt in primary or secondary schools to be self-employed.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have severalHarambee projects in Bungoma District at the moment. Without ma money, no country can develop. At the moment the Government  taking electricity to Bungoma. The Kimilili area has electricity and the electricity supply will be extended to Chwele,  Ruhaha and Malakisi. However you will find that individuals cannot use this electricity unless they have got money. People  would like to have their homes supplied with electricity from the main line so that they can use it for cooking and so on.This can only happen if these people have a way of earning some money. They can earn money from the sale of tea and  pyrethrum </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KISUYA. (ctd.):				Our people need to enjoy life and eat well. You cannot eat well and enjoy life when you are poor You need to have something  to eat and something to put into the pocket.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I appreciate the efforts of the foreign companies which are engaged in 5 tea growing in  this country, I am pleased to say that they have done enough. When you look at</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Mutiso) : Mr. Kisuya your time is up.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KISUYA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir,I would like hon. Koske to second this Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KOSKE: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary DeputySpeaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to make a contributionon this Motion. First of all I would like to the Mover of this Motion for having prepared this very important Motion. I would  also like to thank and congratulate His Excellency the President, Daniel arap Moi for initiating the Nyayo Tea Zone  Development Authority in the country. This Authority has enabled the country to harvest more tea than before. It has also  enabled us to have more job oportunities than we had before. At the same time, it has also enabled the country to earn more  foreign exchange and also save our forests together with taking care of water catchment areas which were previously being  interfered with by the wananchi.This Motion has got, to a certain extent, similar sentiments, and that is why I stand to support it. As time goes, several  changes, some of which are against our wishes, take place. For example, the population is always going up, and we do not  expect it to go down in the near future, but instead, it will continue to go up. As a result of this, the land will also  continue to be scarce.A high rate of population growth</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KOSKE (ctd.):also affects the economy of the land adversely, resulting in its deterioration. As we go ahead, we realize the increasing  poverty affecting many wananchi. This is proved by the fact that these days we are forced by conditions to organize many fund  raising meetings to enable various students to continue with their education because their parents are unable to pay their  fees or even doctors fees in the case of patients. This does not only affect the landless but it also affects those with  land.I would, therefore, like to urge the Ministry of Agriculture to come up and assist the farmers regularly so that they  may learn better methods of farming.The methods we were using a number of years ago cannot help us now,and the oths we are using right now will not be applicable in the next 50 or 100 years. This means that the Ministry of  Agri¬culture should intensify research for the improved methods of farming,otherwise, in the very near future, our land will  not be able to support the population which is alarmingly going up.This calls for the extensive and intensive use of land. Our people, particularly in the area I come from, tend to depend on  one crop for food that is maize. In other parts of the country, people tend to use certain kinds of food only. I think it is  also the task of the Ministry of Agriculture to educate people to change their eating habits so that they k can eat various  types of food and to plant various types of crops instead of depending on only one type of crop which is solely dependent on  a favourable climate. The people should therefore, be taught on the various types of crops which can do well in their  different area3 so that they may plant different kinds of crops in order that if one crop fails, they could depend on another  one for their livelihood. In some areas, people are solely dependent on milk, and so during droughty when there is little no  production of milk, many people die.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KOSKE (ctd.):Therefore the Ministry of Agriculture should ensure that our land is used for the growing of various kinds of crops which  will do well on them. Where there are many crops which can be grown, wananchi should he advised on the crops which would  fetch more money than the others. For example, tea and pyrethrum earn more money than maize and potatoes, and there is every  reason to encourage wananchi in the areas where these crops grow to deal with the ones which will earn them more money.In supporting this Motion, I would like to say that in Bungoma area where conditions allow the growing of both tea and  pyrethrum, wananchi should he encouraged to grow these crops. This does not only apply to Bungoma only, it also applies to  all the other areas of the country where tea and pyrethrum can he grown. These two crops should be grown extensively so That  wananchi may not only get food for their families but also money.Sometimes Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am ashamed to see a farmer with 20 acres of land clothing himself in a blanket  and using only one blanket as his bedding and yet he has land. This means that some of our farmers today are not using good  farming methods which would enable them to plan what they get £ from their land. Therefore, the Ministry of Agriculture  should come out and see to it that these mistakes are corrected.I do not see why field officers of the Ministry of  Agriculture should go to their offices. They should make the farms their  offices where they should go every morning, see the farmers a make the necessary corrections, help them get the crops they  require from the sources and so on. A lot of mistakes are taking place because the field officers do not meet the farmers  often enough</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KOSKE (ctd):Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, a Motion was brought herewhere an hon. Member was complaining of farmers cultivating	right to the riverbanks. If the field officers visit the farmers frequently, they should be able to stop them from farming right to the river  banks and thus drying up our rivers. So, these field officers should visit farmers daily. I would like to suggest that we  should have qualified personnel to this work. Where we do not have qualified field officers, we should organise in-service  courses for them. This is because I have noted that some of them are unable to advise farmers ably.iWith these few remarks, I beg to second the Motion.</Newspeech>(Question proposed)<Newspeech>MR. MBORI: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir,for giving me this opportunity to contribute to this important Motion. I would like to thank the Mover of the Motion, hon.  Kisuya who is the Member of Parliament for Bungoma Central, for having brought this important Motion to be deliberated upon  by the House. This Motion touches on important crops and important matters relating to agriculture. It is a well known fact  that agriculture is the mainstay of this country and that we need to emphasized the cultivation of certain cash and food  crops. The Mover of the Motion hastouched on one of these crops.	The areas where ecological, climatic, soil and labour conditionswarrant the growth of such crops, Sir, I think it is only fair and reasonablethat the Ministry and the Government as a whole to allow the cultivation of such crops as soon as possible. We should not act  like the colonial government which used to discriminate against one area from another andoone tribe from the other thereby  concluding what was their divide and rule system.In areas where the altitude allows the growth of such crops, itwould be reasonable that consideration be given in this respect. Feasibility studies and so on should be carried out to allow  the introduction of such crops</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MBOHI (ctd):						Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this should be started as soon as possible.The Mover of the Motion realises that today, Kenya is nearly becoming self-sufficiency in food production. We are not nearer  enough to this goal because it does not match with our population growth. The Mover is asking the House to allow, especially  in Bungoma District, the cultivation of cash crops such as, tea and pyrethrum. In this way, poverty would be reduced and this  would also add to the sufficiency of food production in this area. I wish the Mover could elongate on this one a little more  so that this request could be extended outside Bungoma District to areas where such factors as altitude, ecology, climate and  so on permit the cultivation of these crops. It is a well known fact that tea is one cash crops which is a very important  foreign exchange earner in this country. If its cultivation is limited to certain areas alone, then we are wealth to  particular areas. The sooner it can be extended beyond areas which cultivate the crop today, the betterit would be for all the people throughout Kenya generally.This country has trained a number of technical officers; we have a number of graduates in agriculture from the University of  Nairobi and diploma holders from the Egerton University College and from other agricultural insti¬tutes, such as, Embu  Institute of Agriculture, Bukura Institute of Agiruclture and so on. These, people have very high skills and at the lower  level, they are employed as extension officers. They do a useful piece of work in advising the local farmers back home to  make use of what is available skillfully. The deployment of these officers who have qualified from the university and from  diploma colleges, is not encouraging. They are not given enough fields to cover.If such an area, as my colleague is requesting, were allowed to growtea and pyrethrum purely on grounds of having achieved the required altitude,labour and other factors which contribute to the successful growth of thesecrops, then graduates from the Egerton University College- and from otherinstitutions, would be fully employed. I am sure that the agricultural skillon these crops would be extended further so that what we axe requesting for, that is, making wananchi able to meet their day  to day demands, would be</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MBQRI (ctd):	achieved. In this way, the wananchi would be able to buy themselves clothes, raise their standard of living, pay school fees  for their children and so on. At least, these people would be able to lead a better life and have good food to eat. Mr.  Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think this would be a target in the fight direction.I hope that the Ministry will see the sense in this Motion.aaa: give it due consideration and stop lmiting it to Bungoma  District alone. It should consider other parts of Kenya which have not yet been given the opportunity to grow tea and  pythrurn as cash crops. These services should be extended to others areas so that we give full employment to the officers who  have been trained and those who will be trained in this respect. This is because the country is continuing to train these  officers up to the university level and they come out with Bachelor of Science in Agriculture and Diplomas in Agri¬culture  from other institutions. These people should be fully employed in various parts of this country and thus, the cultivation of  these crops should be expanded to other areas.According to our 8-4-4 syllabus, agriculture has been given dueemphasis both at primary and secondary school levels. In this respect, it Trill befit us very much to train young persons  from primary, secondary and then to univer¬sity level. In this way, they would be better technicians, agricultural  techno¬crats and people who can help the ordinary farmers in the rural areas where factors such as, altitude, labour, soil  and ecology do allow the cultivation of such crops as requested by my colleague from Bungoma Central. If this is done, I am  sure we shall not only be multiplying wealth for the whole country, but we shall be offering employment opportunities to  those graduates from diploma colleges and from the University of Nairobi.</Newspeech><Newspeech>ME. MBORI (contd.):Now, that this is being practiced quite widely at Kabete.I believe that we shall be able to train others in overseascolleges who will be fully qualified and capable of extendingtheir skills to others so that we can grow more and more ofthese crops in order that the country can prosper. It is onlynot only tea and phyrethrum which could be tested and grown in other areas where they have not yet been introduced. Other  parts of the country require other crops as well like different species of nuts; groundnuts, peanuts, just to mention a few.  Others like cotton could be grown even in the highlands provided proper research has been carried out in various parts of the  country where such crops have not yet been introduced. However, wananchi have been denied that opportunity for one reason or  the other. I think it goes without saying that tea is most of the time grown along side with coffee. In Kasipul/Kabondo, the  area I represent, I do remember that it is just last year and the year before that we were allowed to grow tea at a certain  altitude. The area covers 1,000 metres. That is the equivalent to the area my colleague is talking about. I believe that this  should be the case everywhere. Where altitude and other, factors favour the introduction of such crops as tea and pyrethrum  we should plant more crops so that the rest of Kenyans can also become richer and occupied as the other Kenyans in areas  where these crops have been introduced.With these few remarks Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MDTISTEE FOE INDUSTRY (contd):us to utilise our own raw materials in processing and manufacturing goods for use in Kenya and for export abroad.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY (Contd.):The third role of agriculture is to provide jobs for Kenyans, and the fourth role of agriculture is to earn foreign exchange  from the exports of crops that we grow, which include what are mentioned here, tea and pyrethrum. As you know Sir, Kenya is a  leading exporter of tea and pyrethrum. I want to pay tribute to the Kenyan farmers for having heeded President Moi’s advice  to intensify the culti¬vation of these and other crops.     It is for this reason, there is need to intensify agriculture and the need to promote the development of cash crops as  well as food crops.The Government in its own planning, iry6he Development Plan of 1979/83,which I had the privilege to preside over, has  stipulated clearly that Kenyans land has been divided into five zones. The first zone is the rich arable land which  constitute about 23 per cent of the land. It is actually 18 per cent of Kenyans surface land which is top grade arable soil.  But in the classification of Arable land, 23 per cent has been taken as a measure.Zone two consists of land which is not as fertile as the first 23 per cent of the land, but not arid. The third zone of land  as classified in Kenya consists of semi-arid land. The fourth category consists of arid land, and the fifth and the last  category is virtual desert.Now, the Government went into this great length so that Kenyan;seeking information about the land surface of Kenya and possibilitiesfor agricultural production can be given this Information in its totalityso as to enable them to decide where to carry on their activities0Given the democratic nature of the Kenyan society, farmers have theliberty to go and do farming in any art of the country where theychoose to do it; either on their own piece of land, or on land whichthey buy,or on land which they lease, or on land on which they are temporarily residents, But that freedom of activity in our  economic</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY (Contd.): sphere is guaranteed by the Government.Now, coming back to the crux of the Motion which is that the Government should introduce plantation of tea and pyrethrum in  all appropriate areas, in an appendix to the Sessional Paper No. 1, I cannot remember the exact page, but in that appendix,  the Government has shown how much I and in Kenya is devoted to the production of tea, coffee, milk or dairy farming, and how  much land is taken by all the activities that we undertake here0 Now, if you look under that table you will find that the  only option left for Kenyans is to move into arid and semi-arid areas in order to intensify agriculture there.There are three reasons why the Government is urging the wananchi to move into those areas for greater production. The first  reason is that 20 per cent of the population of Kenya live in the two thirds of the surface which is not fertile. Now, this  20 per cent of Kenyans who live in the arid and semi-arid areas must be helped to utilise that land on which they live for  the production, of commodities which can best be grown there.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY (Ctd.):Government is assisting in livestock production so that the people who live on land which is suitable for livestock  production are encouraged by being givenaccess to credit and by being given advice by extension workers to intensifythe production of livestock. Secondly, Government is introducing irrigation in these areas by using rivers or wells so as to make the land which is otherwiseonly; marginal, to be actually productive. Thirdly, Government is intensifyingresearch into seeds "which will resist drought; seeds which will mature early;seeds which will give a bigger yield per unit of land. Now, this research hasbeen very successful in Kenya and the Government is pouring in| money into"research of this kind in order to make the non-arable land, arable for increasedproduction of cotton, pyrethrum and in areas of higher altitudes, we have tea production.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the third reason why Government ispaying attention to these areas is that since the population of Kenya now standsnearly at 22 million people, and still growing at 3.8 per cent per annum and is now comingdown to 3.7 per cent, these people have room in which to live Areas such asKisumu Rural, Emunaya, Vihiga and so on, are over crowded already. So, the only avanue left for more people to live in these  areas which are now sparsely populated, not because of anything else but because of shortage of water. This is why our  beloved President, His Excellency, Daniel Arap Moi, has placedso much emphasis on water development for the whole country. This is becausewater is the beginning of food. You can last a few days without food, but youcannot last for those few days without water. The Governmente is emphasis on wateris to help these areas which do not have enough rainfall and which therefore, do not produce cash crops of this kind.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY (Ctd.):	In conclusion, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like tosay that God was very kind to us in this country. God gave us a wonderful country,a country that sits astride: the equator; a country with valleys and hills andplains; a country with lakes and rivers and above all, a country with people whoare industrious; people who are forward looking and people who are eager to improveon their standard of living. However these people would not have been able tomove the way they have now moved, if there was no sound political leadership. So,we cannot thank President Daniel arap Moi enough for his wisdom and foresightwith which he has led Kenya. We cannot thank him enough for the vise policies that Kenya has adopted which has made it  possible for Kenya to make spectacular advances in all areas of our economic endeavour.In short, Sir, I have not quarrel with this Motion because it is in linewith Government policy. So, with those few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE.(Mr. Muigai): Thank you, Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker I rise to support the Motion from my Ministry’s point of view. As several hon. Members have said,  including the Minister for Industry, Dr. Ouko, this Motion is in line with Government policy. I would like to make a few  remarks regarding both tea and pyrethrum with particular emphasis on Mt. Elgon area in Bungoma District. As far as tea is  concerned, in order to determine the suitability of tea-growing m Mt. Elgon area Bungoma District, a detailed survey has to  be done by the Ministry of Agriculture in conduction with the Tea Board of Kenya or the Tea Research Foundation. Some initial  research has been done which indicates that there are some areas in Mt. Elgon where the soil is obviously unsuitable for tea  growing.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE (Mr. Muigai)(ctd.):The other areas have very shallow ceils or murrain rocks which are unsuitable for tea growing as a commercial crop. In a  ddition, although the annual total rainfall received in Mt. Elgon region of Bungoma District meets the minimum rainfall  require¬ment for tea growing, it is observed that the period between November and March has very poor rainfall, which is  below the minimum monthly rainfall requirement for successful tea growing. Based on the information available, tea grown in  the Mt. Elgon area in Bungoma District could be prone to severe drought effects between November and March. There will be  hardly any tea plucking for at least five months in a year. This situation raises a major question as to whether tea growing  in Bungoma District would be expected to yield satisfactory economic returns to the growers, with an assumption that the tea  would only be plucked for about seven to eight months for the rest of the year, while during the rest of the year, the tea  would be dormant due to influence of drought in the tea bushes.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is well known that the area proposed for the graving of tea is the same area where  maize is ga grown as a cash crop and where farmers are currently making satisfactory returns from the maize cultivation It is  our experience that where maize is being grown on commercial basis, k together with tea, farmers normally attend to maize as  a priority crop. In view of the incomplete investigations^ and lack of adequate information to evaluate tea growing as an  economically viable project in Mt. Elgon area of Bungoma District, approval of tea £ growing should await x until such time  that the Ministry does a proper survey in the area Tea groyning is being expanded in the whole country through the Nyayo Tea  Zones and Bungoma District is well covered. Already, 6.5 acres have been planted with tea on the Western side of the Forest  Station. The district has a potential of 65O hectares for tea growing under this scheme. Other areas include districts such  as Meru, Kericho, Nandi, Kiambu, Nyeri, Kirinyaga and Kakamega. The major constraints hampering the expansion of x tea  growing is mainly shallow soil Ph, weather and competition with other agricultural enterprises</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE (Mr. Muigai)(ctd.): such as maize and horticultural crops.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, allow me now to turn my attention topyrethrum. Pyrethrum is grown in high altitude areas over 2,000 metres above sealevel with well drained fertile soil and adequate rainfall, that is, an average of 1,000 milimetres per annum of evenly  distributed rainfall. These conditions are present in most areas of Mt. Elgon Division of Bungoma District. In 1970, the  Government was considering plans for diversification of pyrethrum cultivation in Timiyu areas and Mt. Elgon Division was  included in the programme. Under that scheme, farmers in the area were issued planting planting material in 1971, following  which the division was able to produce a marked three metric tons of pyrethrum flowers in the 1971/72 season. The output  continued to expand in the subsequent years as additional planting material were channelled to the areas. By 1975/76, the  output had risen to over 21 metric tons of pyrethrum flowers. Subsequently, however, the crop took a downward trend and  currently stands just over one metric ton per season.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the reasons for this drop in production of pyrethrum flowers include, one, the high coffee  prices prevailing in 1976 and 1978 which encouraged farmers to pay more attention to coffee at the expense of other  agricultural enterprises including pyrethrum. Two, there arose delayed payments at the society level. At the initial stages  of the development, pyrethrum in Mt. Elgon region received crop payment through the District Agricultural Officer, Bungoma.  Later, when these services were handed over to the marketing societies in the area, Kapselkisio and Kaptama, the payment  system deteriorated and, subsequently, broke down.</Newspeech>									<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE(Mr. Muigai) (ctd);Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the third point is that delayed payments were further aggravated by the problem of over- supply of pyrethrum products in the world that beset the industry during the period between 1982 and 1984. Except for the  problem of local marketing at the society level, which is still a major constraint to pyrethrum expansion in the area, there  is still potential for intensified pyre thrum cultivation in this Division.Consequently, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Pyrethrum Board of Kenya has every intention to continue to	 encourage expansion of pyrethrum cultivation in the area.Specifically, the Board has recently deployed a field officer to thearea. Additionally, there are plans to establish a pyrethrum propagating nursery in the area to cater for the local needs  like planting materials, if a suitable site of about 10 to-20 hectares can be located there.These plans should facilitate  gradual resumption of commercial cultivation of pyrethrum on a viable scale in Bungoma District.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, my Ministry does support the sentiments expressed in this Motion. I am happy to have heard  several Members recognise the need for detailed studies and surveys to determine exactly how we should go about growing tea  especially in Bungoma District and particularly in Mount Elgon area.Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Mutiso): Is there any other hon.

KIKUYU asked the Minister forTransport and Communication:(a)	whether he is aware that the road from Kipandni-kwa-Mutisya is almost impassable and that communication between Machakos and Kikima has almost come to a standstill; and(b)	what immediate plans he has to ensure_	that the road is passable and motorable.<Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Keriri); Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(a)	The roads Kipandini to Kwa-Mutisya are the Roads E48O and E447 which were graded in July, 1987 and are now supposed to be passable or motorable. However, I am aware that a section at Kalii on Road E477 becomes difficult to drive on when it rains as a lot of water flows across from. Mbooni Hills. As a permanent solution, construction of a box culvert is in hand, foundation is ready and the work is still in progress since last month.(b)	These roads and other earth roads throughout the country are susceptible to being rendered impassable during the rains, but they will be maintained as necessary, within our financial limitations.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KIKUYU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, consindering that this road was once a museum road, and now the museum has almost been washed off completely, can the Assistant Minister consider re-museuming this road so that it can be useful even in the during the rain seasons?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

KERIRI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I was not aware ofthat bridge and I do not want to pretend to know exactly the place the hon. Member is talking about.

KERIRI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member sayshe heard me say something, and I hope that he listened to what I said well. Isaid that we have graded this road and that we are building a box culvert on the worst part of it. I do not know what other work the hon. Member would likelabourers to do.

Hiribae, who was a part-time adult education teacher at Semikaro Sub-Location in Tana River District, was paid his salary for December, 1985, January and February, 1986.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. DDAIDDO: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, even on 30th September, 1987, this teacher was in my office and he confirmed to me that he had not been paid his salary for these months. Will the Assistant Minister say when this salary was paid to this teacher?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MICHUKI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think it is correct to explain that whereas the teacher concerned may not have been paid for a certain period this year, in so far as the months of January and February, 1986, and, of course, December, 1985, are concerned, I am assured that this honoraria, as we call it it is neither a salary nor an allowance; we call it honoraria for part-time teachers was paid to Mr. Hiribae.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTT SPEAKER (Mr. Karauri): The hon. Member asked when the teacher was paid.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MICHUKI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, in fact, that was the point I was following up just before I came here, and what I know is that Mr. Hiribae was paid in cash, but we were unable to communicate with our offices both in Tana River and in Mombasa before I came to this House.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTISO: on a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister not out of order to try and mislead this House to the effect he said this very categorically that this teacher was paid his salary, and then, in answering a Supplementary Question, he goes round and say that although the teacher might not have been paid for some time, he was paid? This is a contradiction. Furthermore, the Assistant Minister cannot now toll the House precisely when the teacher was paid and how much he was paid because he did not get in touch with their office in Tana River. How can he come to this House and try to toll us a story which he is not sure of?</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: It is a shame.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MICHUKI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have said that Mr. Hiribae was paid his salary for December, 1985 and January and February, 1986. However, if I may explain, we were faced with some cash flow problems throughout the country, and not just in Tana River, but they have now been sorted out. We have arranged that all the pending salary arrears, not just in Tana River, but in all other parts of the country, be paid by the end of this month.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

With regard to that statement, do you not agree with me that the Assistant Minister has told this House something that is not true in saying that this teacher was paid?

The Assistant Minister says that he could not get in touch with Tana River District.

KOSKE: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, while	jappreciating the answer given by the Assistant Minister, is he awarethat using those heavy machines as is said in the answer; is notdifferent from indirect employment of foreigners? If he is aware, Jwhy did he think it fit to buy very heavy machines instead of	jemploying, maybe, 10 extra subordinate staff, particularly, at thistime when we have the unemployment problem?</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. arap CHEBOIWO: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not agree with the hon. Member that buying heavy machines is a	foreign thing. This is because the people who will be using these machines will be indigenous Kenyans. Secondly, when it comes to the work of cutting grass, these machines do more work than the subordinate staff. I am also aware that there is a problem of unemployment in the country. We thought it fit to buy these machines because the subordinate staff who are already there will not be dismissed, but will be used elsewhere as will be the machines. So, he should be happy with these machines. Further, the Medical Officer of Health of Kericho has been told to mobilise his subordinate staff as in addition to the machines. So, for that reason he should be very happy.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MATE: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think, thehon. Member has talked of a machine about which we have confirmation. jNow, could the Assistant Minister tell us roughly the cost of themachines and what it would have cost to employ more local people?</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. arap CHEB0IW0: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, to be honest, I do not have the actual figures with me here, but if that is the wish of the House, then getting them will not be a problem. What we have done is that the Medical Officer of Health of Kericho has already mobilized his subordinate staff for the purpose of clearing all the grass that has rendered the compound insanitary. The hon. Member will now be pleased I thought that he was going to be pleased, but I can see that he is not pleased that my Ministry has already purchased two heavy lawn mowers for Kericho Hospital which will now make it unnecessary to increase the number of subordinate staff working on the hospital compound. So, we have not worked out the costs of how much it would be if we employed more subordinate staff in comparison with the cost of the machines. But, if it is the wish of the House, we still can get those figures.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTISO: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, arising fromone of the previous answers given by the Assistant Minister, to the effect that he agrees that the sanitary state of Kericho District Hospital is in a pathetic state, could he tell this House why they let that situation reach that extent? Is this not negligence of duty? Why wece they just sleeping until they had to be woken up by the hon. Member putting this Question to the House?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. arap CHEB0IW0: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, We were not sleeping and we were not woken up by this Question. The problem was that we did not have enough funds to employ more subordi¬nate staff and buy more machines. So, we were working. This does not, of course, affect only Kericho; it affects other hospitals which are also in the same condition. Kericho Hospital is very lucky since we have already done something about it.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>DR. MANGO: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, arising from</Newspeech> <Newspeech>DR.

We know that the road had been washed away by rain water and the Ministry of Transport and Communications repaired it. Also the water pipe was returned to its original position. So, these people in Mikindani have enough water.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I still stand "by what I said earlier. This road was only repaired after the Mikindani landslide ruined it. The repair work was completed by the Ministry of Transport and Communications sometime in December 1985. Will the Assistant Minister, therefore, withdraw that remark, that the shortage of water was caused by the repair works being carried out on .the road? The road was repaired in 1985 and my Question is talking about, 1987.</Newspeech><Newspeech>M.ARCHBISHOP ONDIEK: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am not disputing the fact that road was repaired.

DDAIDDO: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, is the Assistant Minister in order to try and mislead this House? This is because the lying of pipes is different from the flow of water. It is possible that the pipe was returned to its original position but the people are not getting any water. This is what the hon. Member is saying. So, the Assistant Minister should realise that these people are not getting any water at all.

Sir, whilethanking the Assistant Minister for his recognition of thisproblem, would he accept that this problem came about as a result oflack of foresight on the part of his Ministry? This is because theyknow that this water was not enough to meet the daily demand ofwater in Marsabit Town. The Town is expanding very fast and theMinistry did not make the necessary plans early I enough so as tocater for the growing population of the Town. Will the AssistantMinister order the relevant Department of his Ministry to mobilisethe tankers of the Ministry of Works, Housing and Physical Planningin Marsabit to help the people since the people have totravel a distance of 15 kilometres to go and fetch water?</Newspeech><Newspeech>ARCHBISHOP ONDIEK: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker. Sir,the question of lack of foresight on the part of my Ministry doesnot arise. My answer is very clear; that we observed the situation and discovered that there was not enough water. We even allocated fees funds for feasibility study. The feasibility study is going to cost the Government EShs.3 million. The project itself when	completed is going to cost us KShs.10 million. There¬fore the question of lack of foresight does not arise here. If you look at my reply you will find that we have even sent our people there to do the siting for the four boreholes. This clearly indicates that we have realised that there is a problem there and that wananchi need this water desperately. So, my hon. colleague should realise that there is nothing we can do beyond what we are trying to do now.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KANINDO: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister agrees that there is shortage of water.

KILIKU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Water Development has been telling the people of this country that by the year 2000 A.D. every home in this country will have piped water. Does this plan affect Marsabit Town? How far has the Ministry gone in implementing this proposal?</Newspeech><Newspeech>ARCHBISHOP OHDIEK: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, my brother knows that although the Government talks about the year 2000 A.D. it can be seen that we are making a lot of efforts to supply our people with water. That is why we are carrying out these feasibility studies. So, if the money becomes available we may even implement this plan-before the year 2000 A.D.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. GALGALL0: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as the English say, prevention is better than cure. But it appears that the Ministry of Water Development never took any precautions in this case. They had seen the booming population of Marsabit Town but they took no action to supply sufficient water to the Town. Would the Assistant Minister be honest enough to admit that his Ministry lacks foresight and that it did make any prior preparations for this? I would also like to request the Assistant Minister to crder his Departmental Head there to liaise with his colleagues who have got the tankers and see to it that</Newspeech> 						<Newspeech>MR.

Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir,what I am aware of is that the D.O. of the area spent Ksh.146,000from the Harambee funds to electrify the Health Centre withthe consent of the leaders of the area.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MBORI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, canthe Assistant Minister tell the House what was the original aim of the Harambee funds that he has spoken about instead of saying that it was used for electrification in an area whichhad been electrified by the Ministry.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, theHarambee funds were for the extension and improvement of theOyugis Health Centre. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MBORI: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary DeputySpeaker, Sir. Is the Minister in order to mislead the Houseand the Nation that the funds were for the expansion of	electrification programmes while the main original aim was to expand	the maternity wing of the health centre.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, thefunds which we are referring to started to be collected in .1977About Kshs. 90,000 of that amount was collected in 1981 and itwas banked. The money was not used until 1986, after</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA (CTD.):earned an interest of Kshs.83,000, so the total of the money in bank rose to Kshs.173,000.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, on 1st July, 1986, a loaders meeting for Oyugis Division was held to discuss on how to vise these funds which had been lying in the bank for such a long time. That leaders meeting elected a committee to manage the development of this health centre and to decide on how to use these funds. The D.0. of the area was elected the Chairman, and the other members of that committee were the Locational chiefs, KANU chairman, the divisional KANU chairman, a member of the Kenya Chamber of Commerce, the divisional public health officer, the Member of Parliament of the area was brought in as a co-opted member and also the social development officer for that division.  (END.E)</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this committee is the one which decided that at that time the priority was not the expansion of the maternity wing but to electrify the whole health centre, and they authorised the district officer of the area to vise the funds accordingly. They invited the Kenya Power and Lighting people to go and estimate the amount that would be needed to electrify the place and, later one, they paid KShs.146,000/- to electrify the area which is now operational.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member of Parliament for that area is saying that the priority was to expand the maternity wing. How, when the Assistant Minister denies what the hon. Member is saying, he says that the priority was to electrify the area. Can the Assistant Minister produce the minutes of the meeting which passed the resolution that the priority was to electrify the area?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is possible that the original intention of the Fund was to expand the maternity wing. However, as I have indicated from the facts I have given the House, later on when this very useful committee met, they decided that the priority was not to extend the health centre's maternity wing but to electrify the whole market centre. That, to me, seems very reasonable. For the information of the House, and as I have indicated the Member of Parliament for that area was a member of this committee.</Newspeech>MR. KANINDO: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. As a member of the district development committee, I am sure that the hon. Assistant Minister is misleading the House, in view of the fact that at the time of electrifying the health centre, the rural electrification team was already electrifying Qyugis market, and the health centre was among the priorities of the district development committee. The electrification of the health centre was done with the Rural Electrification Fund. Therefore, it is not true that another fund could have been used for the same purpose of electrification the market at that very time.<Newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I am not aware of those facts but, since the hon. Member is categorically putting them to this House, I would ask him to substantiate his statement.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Karauri): Order. The Question here says that this was a priority of the sub-district development committee and, there¬fore, I do not know how the district development committee comes in.</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. KANINDO: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, at the time the money in question was being used, the rural electrification team, with the authority of the district development committee, was supplying electricity to Qyugis market. The priority of the district development committee was to electrify Qyugus market which covered the health centre, and this was being done with the Rural Electrificat¬ion fund. Therefore, the issue of the sub-district development committee authorising more funds for this project could not have been acceptable; at that time becausethere were already funds from the district development committee to electrify Oyugis town as a whole. That was the time when the electrification team was there.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. 0NYANCHA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I said, we were notaware of those facts. That is why I ask9d the hon. Member, who is malting thiscategorical statement, to substantiate his allegation.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.With all due respect to by hon. friend, he has not replied to the point of orderraised by hon. Kiliku as to whether he can produce the minutes of the meetingwhich was held and which changed the priority from that of expanding the maternity wing to that of electrifying the health centre. Can he produce those minutes and lay them on the Table? If the hon. Member for that area and another one who is a member of the district development committee cannot be a believed, then may the Lord have mercy on the hon. Assistant Minister, if he still have any mercy?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am sure that the Lord will also have mercy on hon. Shikuku. All I am saying is that this money had been lying in the bank for many years, and the leaders of the division</Newspeech>                                                            <Newspeech>MR. ONYANCHA (ctd.):decided to chose a committee on the 1st of July, 1986, to decide on how to use the money on priority basis.

Before we went for Recess last time, I did request the Minister for Transport and Communications to give a statement as to</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ABUYA-ABUYA (ctd.):whether the construction of the road, from Chemosit to Kisii was making a good progressand whether there are any difficulties in the progress of the construction.When I was requesting for this statement, I had in mind the allegations that the present contractor was defying the standards agreed on the terms of the contract. At the same time, the Government was losing an average of about KShs.2 million every month because of the delay and because of the material used for the road construction as the contractor had defied to comply with the standards laid in the contract.	Further to that, Sir, I also asked the Minister to tell us as to whether the contractor had connived with some senior officers in the Ministry to make variations so that more allocations are made to the contractor. The Minister took my request very lightly and did not give the requested statement. As of now, the road completion is behind schedule by nearly nine months, and I understand that the services of this contractor are being terminated. What is more serious is that there are further allegations that when this contract is terminated, the Ministry may offer the contract to the second highest bidder who, I am told, is a brother to the outgoing contractor, that is, H.Z. and Company Ltd. The allegations are that when this contractor moves, then he will sub-contract to Solel Boneh Company. We are being told that if the Ministry goes ahead and calls for new tenders, there will be further delays and that there might be some more money required for the same project.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. ABUYA-ABUY A (CTD):However, I would now like to request the Minister to see that there is no further connivance with some officials in his Ministry to give excess funds without taking into consideration that already many contracts are over-financed. He should also see that there is no more delay as this is the information that we have. Leaders from the two districts of Kisii and Kericho have laboured very hard in pushing the Government to ensure that this road is completed in time. So, I would like to request the Minister to be very careful. If there is going to be a handing over of contracts to the second highest bidder, then firm clauses must be introduced to ensure that what has been prevailing does not occur again, otherwise the Government is going to lose a lot of money. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: On a point of orer, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I do not want to interrupt the hon Member, but I thought I heard him say, 'the highest bidder. Does he mean that there is somebody who bidded lower, and that the contract is not being given to the person who bidded lowest, put it was given to the one whobidded the highest, and who had also committed some sins before? Did I hear that?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ABUYA-ABUYA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, I would like the hon Member to put his question clearly because I did not get it,</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, I thought I heard the hon Member saying that Solel Boneh is going to be" awarded the contract without tendering a fresh, yet it was the highest bidder. This means that there is another person who bidded less. Now, Is that what I heard?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ABUYA-ABUYA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, I will clarify that by saying that when this contract was being awarded, Solel Boneh got it. The second lowest bidder was HZ. How, there are allegations that Solel Boneh want to hand over this contract to the second lowest bidder, HZ. Then HZ are working out a plan so that they sub-contract it again to Solel Boneh. So, we are saying that EZ has already signed many contracts, and so it may not be able to cope with the work. So, there trill be further delay in the construction and more money will be spent on this road. So, if that is the case, I am asking the Minister to ensure that the Government does not lose any more money on</Newspeech>                  		<Newspeech>MR. ABUYA-ABUYA (CTD): this contract,Having said that, I am also requesting the Minister to reinstate thepopular Rural Access Roads programme. It was very popular in the firstplace it was aimed at offering jobs to the people in rural areas. That programmehas been withdraw, but the one that has replaced it is not as popular as the previous one.With regard to the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation, although there has been a lot of praise on its employees, their performance leaves a lot to be desired- especially in the rural areas. With regard to Kitutu East, I amsorry to say that I have raised Questions in this House about Gesima Telephone Exchange which was approved by the district development committee as far back as in 1931. The Minister promised that the exchange was going to be put up in 1982, but so far this has not taken place. I aid raise a Question here about it last year, and I was told that it was going to be constructed in the 1985/86 Financial Tear, but again nothing has taken place. The Ministers have always encouraged hon Members to go their offices or to those of their officers to discuss matters. I personally have been treading to and from the headquarters of Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation, but nothing has happened. So, I am veryseriously requesting this exchange be put up.</Newspeech> 	<Newspeech>MR. ABUYA-ABUYA (Contd.):	As regards the railways, Sir, if the Minister would be kind enough to implement the Motions that are passed in this House, one of them being that he accepted that the railway line from Kendawa to Kisii and to Homa Bay be constructed, it would help a lot. The feasibility studies were completed long time ago, but there has been no move at all, or any sign of construction of this railway line. It is not good for the Minister to accept Motions here which he knows his Ministry will not be capable, of implementing, When people get this information, they are all set. In fact, there are always queriesthe Ministry, and when this does happen, then the people have a negative attitude towards this Ministry.As regards telephones, again, Sir, here in Bunge we cannot even communicate. This is the highest seat in the whole nation! I would like to say that it is a humiliation for the hon. Members of Parliament. When we ask Questions here, and we have problems with the Teachers Service Commission (T.S.C.), National Social Security Fund (N.S.S.F.), Hospital Insurance Fund (N.H.I.F.), and so on, and the answers are inadequate, am I expected as an hon. Member of Parlia¬ment to be running like a messanger to get an answer? No!	Thank you, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTISO: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I also rise in support of this very important Vote because I believe that communi¬cation is one of the very essential facilities of the MODERN world. It is no longer a matter of convenience.The Minister here is asking us to give him a lot of money, and this has been a normal thing throughout the years. But when you try and look and see, put on your telescope to see what is happening all over the country, you will see that certain areas are being neglected, and that the Minister tends to focus his eyes on particular areas. Possibly, it maybe so because in the area where the Minister</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTISO (Contd.):comes from, all the roads are tarmacked. But some areas, like where I come from, it is a very pathetic case. MR.

MUTISO: Sir, the Minister is well aware of the fact.I did not say it is him who tarmacked the roads. I said the area hecomes from is full of tarmac roads. This is true. It is a fact. I amnot saying that it is him who tarmacked those roads.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Magugu):On a point of order, Sir. I thought the hon.

I am just him totrying to ask him to throw his eyes all over the country because he is theMinister for the whole of Kenya. He should see other areas which areneedy. I am not sure whether the Minister got me right.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Magugu):On a point of order, Sir. I would like to know if the hon.

I want to challenge him to tell the House if he has been to moreplaces in Kenya than I have been, or any other Minister, for that matter?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: On a point of order, Sir. The hon. Minister should not take the hon. Member's time. He should listen and note. He will have the whole half hour to reply to remarks. Let the hon. Member contribute to the debate. That is not a point of order.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. MUTISO: Sir, I seek your protection because the Minister is trying to spend my time. He has a lot of time to answer our points. I beg him to put down what I am saying, and challenge, or disprove what I am saying after I have said what I want to say.Sir, I want to ask the Minister to throw his eyes in Yatta, and take, for instance, the road from Katangi to Kithimani, and tell me whether that road which is classified is pasaable? There are citizens or wananchi living in those areas and they want communication. They cannot have it because in that particular area no matatu or bus can pass through. I have been "singing" this song ever since I came to this House in 1983. That is point number one.Point number two, Sir, in that I want also to ask the Minister to cast his eyes, and I challenge him to travel along that road from Katangi to Matuu via Ikombe with his Mercedes Benz, and see whether</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. MUTISO (Contd.):it will pass through those drifts! This is why I am telling him to cast his eyes all over the country and see the problems wananchi are facing. We want communication, and all of us want service because we are taxpayers of this country. The Minister is asking for the money here. He wants the hon. Member for Yatta to put his thumb, as a representative of the people of Yatta, to sanction this money. Once that is done, we do not know how that money is spent, I want an assurance from the Minister that once we pass this Vote, those drifts, particularly from Katangi to Matuu, will be made passable, I challenges those officers of his who are here to travel along that road tomorrow and tell me whether it is passable. There are wananchi there who need service, but they cannot get to It is only small matatus which manage to travel along those roads. There are areas when the rains come, they become totally, impassable. I have been asking Questions in this House requesting the Minister and his officers to look into those roads, but they always turn a deaf ear.</Newspeech>	   <Newspeech>MR. MOTISO (contd.):Further more, there is a road from Matuu to Ekarakara which is still being torn to pieces. When the rains come it will be totally impassable. Are we, the people of Yatta not also entitled to drive on smooth roads? Why is this so, and yet we are taxpayers. Furthermore, I want an explanation from the Minister why we have the worst machines in Machakos District particularly the bulldozers which can uproute the big rocks along the road or pull down the trees? Those bulldozers are not serviceable. When we ask Questions on this we are told that the spareparts were ordered nine months ago, but they have never been received up to this moment. Some of these machines are rotting where ever they have been put. Why are we being given such services, and Machakos is one of the largest districts? I want the Minister when he comes to reply to explain to us why we cannot get similar services as he has in his own constituency.(applause)Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it seems as if the Minister closes his eyes and holds his steering wheel, he would drive up to his house without even looking sideways because roads in his area are so smooth and wonderful. What did the Minister do to this Government to deserve all that and yet the people of Yatta cannot get the same. This is the point that I want to make. I want to tell the Minister that if we do not get these things or I do not get proper answers, there will be trouble in the Committee Stage. I want to promise him that in advance because we need good roads.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Magugu): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is the hon. Member for Yatta really in order to threaten me that there will be trouble in the Committee Stage if I do not give him proper answers?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

MWARUWA: That is not a point of order!</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TOURISM AND WILDLIFE (Mr. Awori); Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for allowing me also to join my colleagues in contributing to the debate.First of all, I want to start by representing a section of  the community that is usually not represented. That is the disabled. I want to express my gratitude to the Ministry for having prevailed upon one of the parastatals the Post Office to start giving consideration to the disabled. The Post Office recently installed telephone booths that can be used by the disabled. I think that is a great consideration. But in similar manner, I would like to call upon the Ministry to prevail upon other parastatals under it, such as the Kenya Railways the Kenya Airways and the transportation industry as a whole to give considera¬tion to the disabled.End I. </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TOURISM AND WILDLIFE (Mr. Awori) Ctd:Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I wonder how many of us in this House, have ever travelled with a disabled person in a wheelchair wanting to get into an aircraft today. There are NO such facilities what¬soever. It is through the kindness of various people that take the trouble of carrying disabled persons in their arms to get them into an aircraft. With the advanced technology, it should not cost that much to acquire a gadget that can be attached to the stairway to get a disabled person in an aircraft.How many of us have travelled on a train with a disabled person,in first class, and experienced the difficulties of a disabled person gettingon a bank. It should not cost that much to take into consideration theplight of the disabled persons. What about the Kenya Buses in Nairobi andall other bases that travel on our roads? All these are licenced by theGovernment. I would like to request the Ministry to take into considerationthat section of the community that is so often neglected.While on the issue of postal services and having lauded them forthe good work they did, I would like to request them to try and do slightly moreon the question of telephone operators. In the countryside where there are noSubscriber Trunk Dialling (S.T.D.) facilities, it is so difficult to reach atelephone operators. Many times I have wanted to put in an urgent telephone callfrom Funyula Post Office, I give up many times and travel 30 kilometres to Busia to use the S.T.D. facilities. I would like to request the Kenya Postsand Telecommunication corporation which is doing such a commendable job, to ensure that there is some improvement in that small area.While still on the question of post offices, we would like some integrity, on the side of the accounts. Many times, account holders have been charged for telephones they have not made. Telephones have been disconnected and the account holders continue to be charged. I understand that there is some fishy business that go on where someone is not charged for his or her</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TOURISM AND WILDLIFE (Mr. Awori) Ctd:account and that account is given to someone else. What is required, Sir, is integrity.Is the Kenya. Forts Authority only supposed to operate in Mombasa? This is because, as far as I know, back in Busia Central, we also have water¬ ways. I would like to request that something should be done so that the Kenya Ports Authority also does some work there. Some years back, there used to be steamers, and what a better way to spend a honeymoon than being on the lake travelling from Kisumu to Sio Port? I would like to request that this facility be reinstated.A lot has been said about roads, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. What is required is inculcation of discipline among all of us starting from children. Here, I would like to commend the Ministry for having set a park where youngsters are taught how to utilize the highways. Why do I say this? I say this because many grown-ups in this country still do not know how to use the highways. When I travel between Nairobi and Sania in Busia Central, almost in every settlement I find bumps. Bumps are very dangerous. The question is why have they been installed? This is because most of the motorists have no discipline whatsoever. When they drive through settled areas, instead of re¬ducing their speed to 40 or 50 kilometres per hour, they will still rush at 100 or 150 kilometres per hour. Lack of discipline brings a lot of tragedies.It is not three days since we saw in the newpapers a mother being carried in the hands of a good Samaritan because a motorist had run down that mother when she was waiting for a bus at a bus stop. This is because we lack discipline; we lack discipline of taking others into consideration.Roads are important for communication, opening up trade and for bringing understanding between people from different sections. I would like to thank the Ministry for having improved our roads tremendously since Independence. For us who are old and who travelled long before we attained Independence, to travel, for example, from Nairobi to Busia, one could plan for about a month because the roads were so bad. Today if I get a telegram or a telephone that I am</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TOURISM AND WILDLIFE (Mr. Awori) (ctd.) required in Busier all I would be worried about would, be the amount of money I would need for petrol. I would like to commend the Ministry for this but I would also like to say that the roads are killers as well. Having constructed these roads, the Ministry has not maintained them to the required standards. How many times do we see a pothole which could easily have been filled and cost the Ministry very little money but it remains in that state for months and months?It is essential that the major highways from Mombasa through Nairobi right up to Busia should be dual carriage way. I know that it costs money, and that you have to spend what you have. But if there is an area where we can borrow a lot of money 011 a long-term basis and have it utilized, then it is where roads are concerned. I would like to request that the Ministry looks very seriously into this.The road from Ruambwa through Nangina to Bumala was supposed to have been tarmacked any time from now. I scrutinized the development plans, and the money which was supposed to have been there at one time has disappeared for some reason. May I respectfully request my good friend the Minister, to look into this because in my constituency, there is not a single inch of tarmac. I do pay road toll twice when. I travel from Nairobi to to my constituency.I would now like to say something on the maintenance of our roads. Why are we unable to maintain our roads? Is it because of the machinery we have?With these few remarks, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EIvIDOR: Alisant e sana, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda, kwa kunipa nafasi hii. Ningependa kuishukuru Shirika la Posta na Simu kwa sababu ya kazi yao nzuri lakini nimeingia karibu kwa kila manyatta hs.di mpakani wa Kenya na Ethiopia lakini hakuna huduma sa simu katika sehemu hiyo. Shirika hili lingekuwa na shabaha</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR (ctd.):ya kwamba kufilria inwaka wa 2000, Irila manyatta itakuwa na sirra.</Newspeech>  <Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR (Ctd.):Bw. Naibu Spile a va Muda, pia ninataka kutoa mwito kwa Waziri aone kvamba barabara zote hasa zile ambazo ziko mpakani wa Kenya na nchi nyingine zinaangaliwa. Hii ni kwa sababu mawakilisho yangu inapakana na Ethiopia, Sudan na Ugandao Lakini barabara zote ambazo zinaenda Ethiopia, Sudan au Uganda kupitia Lokitaxing hazi jasawazishua tangu Kenya ijipatie Uhuru. Hata 'airstrips' ambazo ziko mpakani, bado haziiasauazishwa. Barabara hizi pamoja na airstrips zina maana sana kva upande wa usalama wa nchi hii. Pia zinatumiwa kwa kupelekea dawa kwa wananchi hasa wale tranaoishi karibu na mpaka. na pia kwa wale maofisa arabao vanachanja mifugo katika sehemu hizi.Ajabu ni kwamba, tangu Kenya ijipatie Uhuru hakuna hata Waziri: mmoja kutoka Vizara ya Uchukuzi na Mawasiliano arabaye amevrahi kaitembelea tfilaya ya Turkana. Kwa hivyo, hawawezi kuelewa kile ninachozungumzia lava sababu vao hukaa hapa Nairobi. Waziri tuliyenaye hawezi kujua kwamba barabara zote ambazo zinapitia Lokitaung kwenda mpakani wa Kenya nac.nchi zile nyingine hazij asavazishwao Ninauliza I'aziri aone ya kwamba hizi barabara na airstrips ambazo ziko mpakani zinapitika wakati vote, Pia ninajnuuliza aitembelee VJilaya ya Turkana ili aweze kujionea rawenyeve hali ya barabara hizi. Ni ajabu sana. Bw Naibu. Spika wa Muda, kuwa kwa miaka 24 tangu Kenya ijipatie Uhuru, hakuna hata Waziri wa Uchukuzi na Mawasiliano ambaye araewahi kuiteabelea Wilaya ya Turkana.Taabu nyingine ambayo imetukumba kule VJilaya ya Turkana, ni zile greda na bulldozers. kwa sababu zote ziciearibika na hazifarryi kasi sasa. Tunaambiwa kwamba. hakuna vipuli vya hizi mashine hapa Kenya. Sasa ninauliza Waziri: Ni nani alileta hizi mashine bila vipuli vya kuzirekebisha zikikvama? Kwa D.D.C. tunaambiwa kwamba kila kitu kiko wilayanio Tunaambiwa kv.araba, vipuli na vitu vingine viko katika raakao makuu ya wilaya. Lakini tukienda huko tunskuta trekta na greda zote zimekwama huko na maofisa ambao wanafanya kazi huku hawana kitu cha kufanya maana: hawana yifaa vya kufanya kazi, Sasa vanalipwa mshahara bila kufanyia kazi. Kama hakuna vipuli Kenya, ningeuliza Waziri awajiri wale watu</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. EKIDOR (contd.):ambao wanaitwa road guards; wale ambao wanatatengeneza barabara kwa mikono. Hawa watu wanaweza kufanya kazi ya kutengenesa barabara na kulipwa mshahara mdogo kuliko wale madereva wa trekta. Hawa watu wanaweza kuajiriwa kutoka Wilaya ya Turkana ili watengeneze hizi barabara katika wilaya hiyo. Ama Waziri anaweza kutuletea machine nyingine katika Wilaya ya Turkana ambazo ni sa gharama ndogo na ambazo zina vipuli hapa nchini badala ya zile ambazo hazina vipuli hapa.Jambo lingine ambalo ningependa kusema ni kwamba Tarafa ya Lokitaung imegawanywa mara mbili. Sasa imekuwa na tarafa, mbili, moja inaitwa Kimbichi na hapa hakuna mtu ambaye anajua Kimbichi iko wapi, lakini mimi ninaijua. Kimbichi iko maili 300 kutoka Lodwar. Iko katika mpaka waKenya na Sudan. Wakati wa ukoloni, barabara za kwenda huko Kimbiclii ambazo ziko mpakani wa Sudan na Ethiopia zilikuwa zikipitika, lakini wazungu waliporudi kwao barabara hizi sasa hazipitiki. Sasa zimemea miti na wakati tunaingiliwa na majambazi kutoka nchi jirani, polisi wetu huwa na shida sana kwa sababu hakuna njia za kupitia wa.ki.wafuata. Kwa hivyo, ningeuliza Waziri apeleke greda au trekta anibayo itakuwa ikirekebisha hizi barabara mpaka Kimbiclii.Kwa hayo machache, naunga mkono.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. WAKIONDO: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, forgiving me this opportunity to join my colleagues in contributing to thisvery important Vote for the Ministry of Transport and Communications. Sir,let me first thank the Minister and the entire Minis try for the good workthey have done in connecting Kitui and Meru Districts by the construction ofMucemi Bridge. However, Sir, may I request the Minister to set aside fundsfor the maintenance of roads which are now impassable although we still have	buses coming from Mwingi to Meru Tcwn, we recognize the effort already made by the ministry.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker Sir, since the present Minister forTransport and Communications was appointed, he has never paid surprisevisits to the district as he was doing before when he was the Minister for Health.We would like to request him to make these surprise visits to Meru. At the moment,all road tractors are junks, and so are the road graders. Once an officergives an okay for a certain road to be graded, the work fails due to lack ofsupervision. Once a tractor has been given out to a division in Meru District,there is nobody to supervise its operation. The tractor is taken by the driverand if a lorry driver wants diesel, he takes the diesel from the tractor and soldThis is a bad weakness and, therefore, we need supervisors in the district.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I was perturbed last Session whenthe hon. Assistant Minister for Transport and Communication answered a Questionsin this August House and informed wananchi in Tharaka and in Meru in general?that the road from Mitugu to cinkariga, which is the divisional headquarters,would be graded before 30th of May this year, but up to this date, this has notbeen done. This was a Question by Private Notice which was asked on the 14th of April, 1987. I wonder why an hon. Minister of the Kenya Government has to come and mislead this August House that this road would be graded between such-and-sucha time. The Minister gave a deadline when this would be done but up to thisminute, nothing has been done. May I request the Ministry to do something about this road. This road is completely impassable.</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER, They are not ashamed!</Newspeech><Newspeech> MR. WAKIONDO: They are not ashamed, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, may I remind the Minister that there are some roads in my constituency whichhave never been attended to for about four years now. These are, RoadsE790, C92, E788, E813 and E12. These roads have never been attended toand you cannot even drive a tractor on them due to potholes and galleys on them. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, read access is very important. There was a team that came to Meru District and was seconded to the variousaccess roads in the divisions in the district, but these operators have not been Iallocated any money. I would like to request the Minister to allocate fundsfor the improvement of these access roads because they are very useful as they render intensive service to wananchi living in the area.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the construction of roads goes along with the construction of bridges. The Meru District Development Committee has recommended, that the bridges between Meru Town and Mikinduri on the road to Gatithini be constructed. All these bridges were washed away by the rains and nothing has been done about them. Once they are repaired, they are washed away again because they only use timber to repair them. The bridges between	Tunyai on Thingithu River, Kathita River connecting Nkondi River on the road to	Mukothima, have been given to the Ministry but Nthanantu it has never taken any action to repair them. May I again request the Minister to do something about the implementation of the Motions which were passed earlier on in this House, a point which was raised by hon. Abuya-Abuya and other hon. Memberswho have spoken before me.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we passed a Motion in this Houserequesting the Government to extend the Nanyuki-Meru Railway-line to Embuand onto Sagana. This has now taken more than six years and we would like tobe told by the Minister exactly what they are doing about this. We wouldlike to know what the Ministry's future plans are. At the moment, we havelong trailers which are doing the transportation work and they havedamaged the road between Nanyuki and Meru.Coming to the Kenya Posts and Telecommunication Corporation, may Iremind the Minister that Tharaka area completely in darkness. We have never MR. VAKIONDO (Ctd.)	been given telephone services in this area. The only telephone servicewe have is at the District Office’s office and therefore, between the office of the District Officer and the entire division, there is no telephone and there is no way in which you can communicate unless you go to a police postwhere you can get telephone service. As an hon. Member of Parliament, I do not havea telephone in my house and I have to go to the police station to ask for a telephone Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I request the Minister to do something about this. I would like him to provide us with telephone services in Marimanti Gatunga, Nkondi, Mukothima so that we can connect these areas with othertelephone networks. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would now like to say somethingabout the replacement of retired officers. At the moment, when officers workingin the district road maintenance unit retire, there is no replacement. So,	the work of maintaining our roads is left just like that, without anybody takingit over. Would the Minister come up and tell us exactly what is happening?Who is supposed to replace officers who retire in the districts or in thedivisions. I am asking this because when these officers retire, there is noreplacement, although their posts are established. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, in Meru we have set aside a plot forthe construction of a vehicle inspection centre so that we do not have thepeople from Meru going to Nyeri to have their vehicles inspected. We have very many vehicles and we would like/to know when this inspection centre is going to be contructed. We would like to know which year and which date this is going to be done.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, may I request the Minister to constructan airstrip in my constituency because my area is a sensitive area wherebandits are striking now and then. So, we need to have enough security at hand so thatwhen these bandits strike, we can help our people in the area.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, when you look at the money allocated to districts, or provinces, you will find that this money is notshared equally. You will find that some of the districts are not given anything, while others are given a lot of money. We would like to know the criteria used by the Treasury when distributing this money. It is not thedistrict development committee which distributes this money. The districtdevelopment committee is there to apportion the money to the various projects.Therefore, may we be told exactly why some districts are getting more moneythan others, while these districts have more development than those other districts which have lagged behind since the attainment of Independence and nothing is being done about them. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is a small point which I would like to make regarding minor roads. We have not been told the difference between the minor roads and access roads, nor have we been told who are responsible for maintaining them. These roads have been left aside and they have been washed away, the bridges have collapsed and nobody is able to fall us who is reponsible for the maintenance of these road.	With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, I beg to support.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

GACHANJA: Thank you Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir for giving me this chance to join my colleagues in saying something about this very important Vote.As many of my colleagues echoed, this is a very important Ministry because all the travelling either by air, road and sea is under this particular Ministry. As regards the Kenya Airways, the Government is doing everything possible to change its management now in an attempt to make organisation a success. The government can continue changing the management, but until such time that this airline starts seeing itself as any other airline that is the time they "start thinking in terms of competition it is not going to succeed. I am saying this because I have received some complaints. I know that it is possible for you to go to ± an office of Kenya Airways and not be attended to for more than ten minutes whereas if you go to offices of other airlines like Lufthansa, you will receive a quick reception. I have a friend who tried to book a flight with Kenya Airways and he was informed through the computer that there was no seat. In the same airbus, there was another friend who reported, later that the airbus was half full. That was a big omission I suggest that Kenya Airways management should definitely look at itself as a competitor. It should do what the other airlines do. We do not want this airline of ours to collapse.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. GACHAITJA (contd.):They must think of marketing. They must organise seminars to be abla to have a marketing approach like any other airline. As long as they continue thinking that they have Government support, they are not going to succeed.As far as the Kenya Railways is concerned, I, have no quarrel with this organisation. As much as I would like this organisation to do all the transportation, there is one thing which I would like to say. The complaint about the Kenya Railway, is the delay, and that is why the people are ready to pay as much money as possible to have their goods hauled Toy road because of the little delay that we have in the railway transport. If they can rectify this situation, there will be no quarrel, and we will support it. Turning to road transport, not all the vehicles should be condemned. We have got the semi-articulated trailers which have three axles. I am sure, if they can carry the right tonnage they cannot spoil the roads.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. GACHAMJA (CTD):In any case, if we are going to ban transportation by road, we should ban all the vehicles owned by foreigners and protect African owned transportation firms.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as far as the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation is concerned, there is a lot of praise for them, and I join those who have praised them before me as I have no quarrel with the Corporation, However, there should be somebody to take care of all these telephone booths which they have installed all over the place because sometimes they break down. We have some broken down booths in Waithaka which have now taken more than one month without anybody attending to them. So, the Corporation should check that small omissionsI would like the Minister to pay attention to weigh bridges When he comes to reply, I would like him to tell this House and the nation how much money the Government has collected through the weigh bridges by way of punishment to defaulters. I can bet that that money is negligible because' by charging those who default in transporting a little bit more tonnage than allowed, the Ministry is encouraging corruption, All that a transporter needs is to connive with the policemen at the weigh bridge, and his vehicles are going to be allowed to pass with as many as 60 tones. The alternative I would suggest here is that maybe the Government could put some charge on any extra tonnage hauled upcountry rather than to say, "If you exceed this tonnage, we are going to punish you in this and that way" because this would be open corruption. We understand that the Minister pays surprise visits to various places. Let him to go to our weigh bridges and see how many trucks are being delayed there unnecessarily, with some of them perhaps taking a whole day, because somebody somewhere is looking for a way of receiving some bribe0 Instead of giving ourselves a chance of corruption, I suggest that the Government levy an additional fine on extra tonnage so that if you are allowed to transport 40 tonnes, and you have brought with you 45 tonnes, you are asked to pay for the extra tonnage rather than to be told that you will be taken to courtWhereas the Minister should pay surprise visits in some cases, I do</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. GACHANJA (CTD.)not encourage him to pay such a visit to matatua or arrest their owners I would rather have him go and. sec hew the roads the matatus use are "being constructed. we are going to pay huge sums of money, hut the international contractors who are awarded these contracts misbehave,, I am sure that there something wrong going on with them, If you take a road under construction, say from Nairobi to Thika, you will find that before it is even completed, you have got potholes in ito So, there must be something wrong somewhere,, ire have old roads like those used during the war, which stayed good for as many as 30 years. The new roads of today, however, are done and within a year, they need to be reconstructed. There must be something wrong somewhere. In any case, I would like the Government to come out with a clear cut policy so that all road construction in the country is dons by our indigenous contractorsand not foreigners who are going to take away all our money, and thereby steal our foreign exchange, and they do not do a good job. Therefore, I recommendthat all this work be done by our own contractors.There was a very big omission which took place when Dagoretti wasengulfed by Mairobi. As this House knows, Dagoretti used to be in Kiambu. Inthose days, some of our roads were tarmarked. However, since Dagoretti becamea part of Mairobi, those roads do not even have murrain, leave alone tarmacThe tarmac that there was has been eroded. We plead every day that the roadsbe tarmarked, but nothing happens,. So, I request the Minister for Transportand Communications to look for a way of making the roads in Dagoretti uniformwith others. As you personally said, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, theroads in some parts of the country are terribly impassable. It is a big shamethat in Kawangware here, if there is a sick person in one of its areas, he has to be carried on shoulders because no vehicle can go there.With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support. MR. NYOIKE: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to join my colleagues in supporting this Vote. I would like to congratulate the Ministry for 'the work it has done. This is one of the</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. NYOIKE (CTD.):largest Ministries we have and, obviously, the Minister enjoys a lot of power, being in charge of such an important Ministry which encompasses very important areas of our national life. On the whole, I am glad to say that it has done a very good job and that it should be congratulated.When the Minister comes to reply to this Vote. I will he will takea minute or two to explain, for the education of embers and the general information of the public, what the latest criterion is in deciding what roads are to be tarmacked and which ones are not to be tarmacked when I used to know that when it comes to the so-called Class "A" trunk roads and other major roads like Class ,!B" roads, and so on, national considerations are always important with regard to such matters as security, the ability of people to move from one part of the country to another, and so one. However, I am curious about the Classes "C” and "D" roads. I used to think that the criterion of using money on these roads was in terms of the returns obtained from those roads. When I look at the map of Kenya, I find that there are certain areas which are very productive and where investment in such roads would bring in quicker returns, thereby causing economic repercussions in the country that would help the development of these areas. I am always amazed when I look at the roads in Nyandarua, for example, particularly in an area called Kinangop and another one called Kipipiri. These are the areas that feed Nairobi as they are very high potential, and yet when you look at the development of the roads there you find that not enough has been done. I congratulate the Minister and the Government on the tarmacking of the road between Njambini and Magumu that is being done now, but I am sorry to say that this has taken much too long. However, we are grateful that this is now being done. I would like the Minister to explain why areas with very high potential land and where a lot of produce is being taken to the market there are such high potential areas like Kitale, Litokitok and others do not have their roads developed as is the case in some other areas which are equally parts of Kenya but where returns may not be as high Accepting that we are all Kenyans, I think that</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. NYOIKE (CTD.):in terms of the utilisation of very scarce resources, the most important principle to he applied is the question of returns.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. NYOIKE (ctd);Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to pleadwith the Minister to direct his attention to Kinangop area andKipipiri area and other areas in Nyandarua where we need at least tomurram roads. Many of our roads are not passable. There are class "C”roads that have never seen murrain since their creation. We wouldlike them to be murramed so that our produce can reach the townsMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, while I am stillthinking about that area by the way and while congratulating theMinister for the great work, that is being done by the Kenya Postsand Telecommunications I would just like to mention in passing thatwe have some telephone equipment in our area that was made before the Flood. The equipment is really old. It is equipment that really does not serve the people as it should. I hope that the Minister will be able to deal with it very s quickly and be able to give us a telephone exchange that is modern. When other people are talking about STD we are talking about very old equipment You have to wait for this equipment to make some funny noise and even if the operator was active and wanted to listen sometimes he cannot because thisequipment breaks down all the time I hope that the Minister will do something about telephone equipment in our area. Elsewhere in the country, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, while I am still dealing with the question of telephones, so ma telephone booths are not operational. One of the reasons, we are told, is that sometimes the money has not been collected; the coins fill in and when you go to insert your coin, you cannot do so because the box is already full. I hope that the Kenya Posts Telecommunications Corporation will see to it that the money is collected on a daily basis I would have thought that a commodity like money should not be left Carelessly lying around for too long.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>MR. KYOIKE (ctd);	I therefore hope that we shall not fail to use the telephones simply because the money has not collected from some of those booths, I concur with those who say that when something goes wrong with these "booths the repair of those booths takes too long.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to mention this problem of workers who lea.ve work at about 5.00 p.m. and do not get home until 8.00 p.m. or 9.00 p.m., particularly in Nairobi, Mombasa, Nakuru and Kisumu. We have a serious problem in many of our towns. I would like to request the Minister to see to it that more urgent and may be temporary measures are taken to alleviate this problem.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is a habit amongleaders and politicians of blaming matatus for all kinds of evils. But I think the greatest blessing this country ever got was the matatuso This is because if they are not there the whole transport system in the country will collapse We have got into the habit whereby anybody who stands to speak curses the matatu. When you are driving you say "Look at this matatu." But what we forget is that these services are over extended The numbers of people travelling by these matatus are numerous. You may talk of over loading but you will find if a mother needs to go home and there is no other vehicle she would squeeze into a matatu. It does not matter to her what the owner of the matatu thinks. I think we need some temporary measures to try to solve this problem- It does not matter whether it is lorries or anything else that will be used to transport people on temporary basis.	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am very grateful and everybody in this country is grateful to His Excellency fire the President for introducing Government City Bus Service in Nairobi But we are agree that this is not enough. It will take the Government a very long time before we can get money to buy all the buses that are needed therefore request the Minister to U3e any imagination, with the vehicles we already have, to see what can be done to help our people.Matatus came about as a result of a response to a needthat was there. The late President Mzee Jomo Kenyatta said, Allow them to operate and do not harass them." That hashelped us a great deal. So,something needs to be done. I see s, lot of vehicles lorries and so on - parked there. Maybe if something was done between 4.00 p.m. and 7.00 p.m. and these vehicles were allowed to transport people without much ado this could help our people. It is a shame; it is a national shame that so many manhours and womanhours have to be used by people who have left work and they do not get to their families until 8.00 p.m. or 9.00 p.m. By the time they get there they are already tired and in bad mood and this is not good for our families. I hope that the Minister will look into the direction of some temporary measures before we reach a position where the country can afford to have good buses for everybody; something that can be done within the resources of our country. The private sector of this country can do a great deal if they are given encouragement and direction by the Government. I think the area that we should move into now is particularly the area of transport to help our people to get to work and get where they are going on time without wasting so much time. MR. NYOIKS (ctd);There is a lot of energy wasted nationally; a lot of human resourcesand manhours that are wasted by these people who z are leaving work at 5.00 p.m. and cannot get to their homes until very late.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Minister very much for what he has done. But there is a lot to be done. This Ministry of his is very, very large and it requires much more resources than it is getting now. It requires urgent and better use of the resources that they have been using up and till now.Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Biwott): Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to contribute on the debate on the Estimates of the Ministry of Transport and Communications. First of all I think the greatest thanks should go to His Excellency the President because a lot of roads are repaired and attended to because of his own visits. Every time the President visits a particular area there is some attention on the roads. This brings relief to the people who use those roads in those particular localities. I would also like to congratulate the Minister and Ms Ministry for the tremendous work they have done, considering the funds s made available to them every year and also considering the pressure they are subjected to especially on the highways where is excessive over loading and over speeding and aggravation of potholes. They face excessive demands compared to their ability and their resources. We know that the question of roads is a touchy one; everybody wants a road to his own home. Everybody wants a road to his own district. But due to non-availability of funds these things cannot be achieved.Despite all these problems the Ministry has seen it fit to ensure</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY AND REGIONAL DEVELOFMENT(ctd);everybody is attended to even if it means attending in the most demonstrative manner or even if it means repairing the roads because the President is going s to pass there.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, everybody has talked about access roads and how bad the roads are in his own district.This is not peculiar to some particular places because everybody is indeed suffering I have the same problem in my own district. I hope the hon. Minister who used to be very active when he was Minister for Health I would Hike to appeal to him to visit mydistrict, together with his staff, so that, he can see the road to Chesongoch which requires urgent attention arid where the Ministry has spent thousands of pounds without much relief. I know that that is not his problem but it is the nature, of the land terrain and the weather conditions in that particular place.Be that as it may, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to urge my colleague to see to it that a lot of attention, is paid to the roads. I am talking about repairs and maintenance. This is because potholes have been a major cause of accidents in this country. They have also been the cause of damage to our own vehicles. But I must congratulate him because there is now evidence that the roads are being repaired; even in the city here.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR E3ISRCY AMD REGIONAL DS7EL0H£ENT (ctd.):There is a lot of evidence of roads being repaired, and this is very good because that is an assurance that those roeads can be used much longer.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would also like to thank the Government, His Excellency the President and the Ministry for being innovative enough and introducing the toll stations along the roads. That has helped to at least earn some money for the repair of roads. Even though it was a bit strange in the beginning, it is now being taken for granted. It may, perhaps, be a good idea if the Minister could consider adding some more toll stations in areas where such services are not available so that the roads can be repaired by the people who damage them.Sir, I would also like to add my voice to those who have spoken about rural access roads because we need rural access roads especially to the agriculturalareas where the crops have to be collected and taken to the market. We also need rural access roads to open up new areas that have not been opened hitherto. At the same time, we would like to see some consideration being given to the maintenance of the existing rural access roads which are showing signs of deterioration. Also, Sir, the road safety appeals that the Ministry has mounted deserves some congratulations, and I do not want to waste too much time on it.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, the greatest score in success by the Ministry of Transport and Communications has been achieved by the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation. Today, Kenya can count herself to be one of the leading countries in providing telephone communication facilities to her nationals. I would like to urge the Minister to continue with such tempo and assist his staff as much as possible so that they can do even more. These days one would find a telephone installed in a market and people using it. This is very great because, at least., we can now work with greater efficiency. This has been a3 a result of the dedication of the officers who are involved in the provision of these facilities and also due to the s high degree of expertise andTHE MINISTER FOR ENERGY MD REGIGMAL DETELOFMEIJT (ctd.): and knowledge of those who handle this work.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, no leys congratulation is merited "by the Kenya Ports Authority. The Kenya Ports Authority is, perhaps, the most important of all our communication network "because it is the point of entry into Kenya and also the point of exit from Kenya. It is where a lot of money is earned, and it is where all our foreign exchange earning depends on. The Kenya Ports Authority is also as where our communication to the rest of the world is felt and seen, it is where our communication is judged as to whether it is efficient or otherwise. It is also an area where ire interact with the hinterland and with the neighbouring countries which need that facility in order to earn foreign exchange and also in order to receive goods for their own development. I think "it is easier to look at the mistakes and to forget the tremendous responsibilities that impinge on those who mariage something. Management is a mammoth job which, in fact, requires a lot of support. Because the management of the Kenya Ports Authority has been able to improve and, at least earn a little bit more than what they used to earn before, I think they deserve some congratulations. However there are a few things that require attention, some of which touch on my own Ministry.Sir, the other day when I was at the Coast, I ventured to visit one of the installations which serve my Ministry’s interest. I visited the Jetty and supply fuel into the country and also the water system which is crucial. I was amased to see that the whole thing is corroded and rotten and requires urgent attention. I hope that those hon. Members who have also seen it will support any attempts that are made in order to enable the Kenya Ports Authority to attend to those most urgent services which are required for the efficient operation of the Authority. Petty considerations should be ignored for the better appreciation of the whole complex as it is. "When I say that petty considerations should be ignored, I am not saying that they should be ignored because they do not matter; they should be taken into account in their relative forms. However, the consideration should be relegated to where it actually belongs, so that we can look at</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENERGY AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (ctd.):the things that matter and that can stand tomorrow; we should look at the things that we can he proud of tomorrow when we look back.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, saying this, I am seeing an hon. Member of Parliament who, once h upon a time, was a director of one of the Govern¬ment corporations, and who looked forward and, through his own zeal, was able to construct Uchumi House when everybody was worried that that house might not stand and pay for itself. That building became the best investment ever because it was constructed in time; it was done for the good of this nation and it was done because it was right to do it. Today we can look forward to that one and say that we did a good thing. I think it is in that spirit that we should look at the functions of the Ministry of Transport and Communications.With those few remarks, Sir, I beg to support the Motion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

It is now time for the Mover to reply.</Newspeech><Newspeech>TIIE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr„ Magugu): Thank you, Sir I will try to be brief because, as hon Members will see and have noticed, all ,the points which have been raised or the comments which have been made by the hon0 Members have been taken note of by the officers concerned with various departments and sections of the Ministry. Therefore I am not going to comment on each and every hon Members comments.First of all, I want to correct the impression which was given by the Press yesterday or the day before when I was", moving this Vote that Kenya Railways Corporation will be financed to the tune of UoSo$28 million for the second railway line between Mombasa and Nairobi. That is not what I said„ The correct version is that that money will be made available by the World Bank through the International Development Association (l.D.A.) to revitalise the Kenya Railways Corporation and not to add or to construct an additional railway line. Sir, Member for Kitutu East, hon. Abuya-Abuyaj,made a very serious allegation when he was contributing to the debate. He said that the Ministry was negotiating to give the contract or the</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Contd.): job to between Kisii and Chemosit to give that road works to the second highest bidder That is misleading and completely mistaken If the hon Members had taken time to look at the newspapers of last Friday, he could have seen that the job was already advertised or it is going to be retendered. I had already conveyed that information to two of our colleagues who are hon. Members from that area.  We are not negotiating and we are not doing anything else  other than retendering for the job We hope that this job is going to be awarded in the normal manner to the best qualified and the onewho deserves the award Therefore, we have also in mind that no	inconvenience should be caused to the people living in that area® That is to say that we are making it within a very short time so that normal construction work will resume as soon as that stage is finalized. Sir, if I talk a little bit about the role of the district	development committees (D.D.C.) and the Ministry’s part, in that role, hon Members have always wanted to ask us to do new roads, or to do regravelling, or to do this and that I have said this before and I want to repeat it. We have very little, as a Ministry, to influence which road to be done first, second and third, or which road to be constructed in any one given district I am sure that hon Members are aware that that is the role of the D.D.C.s, and we are all members of the D.D.C. Therefore, what comes to us and what we forward to the Treasury for money is what has been properly given priority by the respective D.D.C.s, and we have no powers, what so ever to change those priorities© The money given to us by the Treasury will be allocated in accordance with that priority listSir, I want to talk a little about the parastatals, and I want to re-asssure this House that the Government has complete faith in the management of the parastatals as a whole, and in particular, parastatals falling within the Ministry of Transport and Communications.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Contd.): namely, the Kenya Ports Authority, the Kenya posts and Telecommuni¬cations Corporation, the Kenya Railways Corporation, and also the Kenya Airways. The Government has complete faith in the management and running of those parastatals. We are not losing money. If anything, we are making headway from the initial start in 1970. After the collapse of the East African Community up to this present time those parastatals are doing very well.</Newspeech> <Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Ctd):Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, those parastatals tire doing very well as compared with hon they performed before the collapse of the community. If you take the Kenya Airways as an example, I have noted that some of the points which have been raised by hon. Members are very valid. I have experienced some of the things mentioned by hon. Members. I am aware, Sir, that you may wish to travel by Kenya Airways and on arrival at the checking point you get information that it is full, or it is late and so on. We have already drawn these points to the attention of the Board What we would like to do is to let the Corporations run as independently as possible with least interference from the Ministry That is why we have Boards, the management and the other staff to run them0 We are also busy doing other things in the Ministry and, therefore, we would wish that this continues that way.The Kenya Airways is in good hands and we trust that the new Board and management will streamline some of these short falls. We continue to urge the Government to re-equip the Kenya Airways. I also agree with the contribution made by hon. Khasakhaia to the effect that we should also address ourselves to the local needs of our people. I can assure the House that the Government is looking into this seriously and it is going to be implemented as soon as the money becomes available. It is an expensive exercise but I can assure the hon. Members that the Kenya Airways is doing very well compared with what we have been used to in the past. They have a loan commitment which they meet at the rate of Shs.lOO million every six months and they have not defaulted This is in relation to the Airbuses and we hope we are going to satisfy .our people for local purposes,, that is, when travelling between Mombasa, Malindi, Kisurauv, Eldoret and so on. I would assume that hon. Members are aware of the “Msafiri" which is set aside by the Kenya Airways for use by our ownselves.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (ctd):Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to address myselfto the question of Motions passed in this House. I believe that it has beenreferred to by several speakers implementation of Motions, particularly relating to "the Kenya Railways Corporation, I believe we have passed .two Motions to that effect, that is, on Meru and Kericho Districts. It is true, we would like to implement these Motions but, again, I have to refer the hon. Members to the question of whether we have money to do so. Feasibility studies will have to be done and justifications would also have to be arrived at.When we passed a Motion in this House that we want to have a KenyaNational Shipping Line, feasibility studies were done carried out and the Government agreed that this body be introduced. After allthat," it was indeed in the interest of the country, to have a NationalShipping Line. As a result, the Kenya Ports Authority is going into ajoint venture, on behalf of the Kenya Government, with a German company inthe ratio of 70 per cent for Kenya and 30 per cent for the foreign company.Hon. Kililcu raised a question as to whether we are going to ownships. I would like to say that this will be considered as a second phasebecause we have to try and see what it is like; we have not operated thisShipping Line before. Therefore, when it becomes justifiable, we shall do that. That is one of the reasons why we are very anxious to get this guarantee of loan approved by this House because most of the foreign ships are trying, as I said, to avoid the;Mombasa Port because of the conditions of the at the Port. I believe that that particular item is due for discussion later on in the afternoon or next week.The Ministry does not look at its performance on the basis of parochialis or districtism but in terms of their national importance. We have got differ¬ent classifications of roads and we shall not be confused to be held res¬ponsible for roads which are actually the responsibility of the localauthorities. In fact, hen. Members will agree with me that we went out of our own way, during the 4th All Africa Games, and re-surfaced the roads which</Newspeech><Newspeech>TBE MIMSTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (ctd):they now see in the City of Nairobi. All these work was done by theMinistry of Transport and Communications and it cost Vote, close toif not slightly above Shs.30 million. That has because it was necessary to do so.For that matter, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, my colleague,the hon. Minister for Local Government and ourselves^?~re hoping that theresidents of Nairobi would agree to the introduction of toll stations.For roads to be maintained in Nairobi, there should be a way of raisingthat money because as hon. Members have said before, roads have to bemaintained. The maintenance vote, for this particular time, has been cutby slightly more than half. That is why hon. Members will see, from time totime, our team in the field filling potholes with sand, murrain and with anyother material simply because the maintenance fund is exhausted. Under suchcircumstances, Mr.. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, what do you do?The Kenya Railways Corporation has a programme of revitalisingitself through assistance of the Overseas Development Agency (O.D.A) fromthe Uninted Kingdom and the World Bank. This programme will take threeyears or so. After that we shall go for the second phase and it is duringthat time that we hope we shall get additional equipment. Right now, weare committed to acquiring and we have already finalised all formalitiesfor acquisition of additional 10 locomotive engines. I believe that with those locomotives, we shall be able to meet some of the challenges which are pha facing us.</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS ( Ctd. ):Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, hon. Shikuku reffered to the telephone system inthe National Assembly here. I would like to say that this will be dealt within the normal manner by the Speakers Committeet I think this is the right thing to do instead of me having what should be done and</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.Shikuku: On a point of order., Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker.Is the Minister really in order to refer this matter to the Speakers Committeewhen he is in charge of  communications and this does not matter wnere.	I think he is misleading this House. In my contribution yesterday, I told.him that he should start improving telephone services in this House because itis the highest authority in the land. He is now saying that he has been referredthe matter to the Speakers Committee, but for his information, I have been referring s this matter to the Committee for many years and nothing has been done. Thetelephone exchange in Parliament Buildings is the oldestin the Republic of Kenya. It was installed in 1964when I was here and it is the most useless instrument! Can he take up this responsibility himself and forget aboutthe Speakers Committee because it cannot anything.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Magugu): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is most unusual for hon. Member for Butere to disregard such an important Committee. However, I would like to assure him that I shall liaise with the Speakers Committee and I am sure  something will be s done about this.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, the point I was going to make is that the Kenya Posts , and Telecommunication Corporation is doing well and we appreciate the comments from the hon. Members. As the hon. Member for Nyandarua said, u we collect money from the telephone booths very regularly because we needthat money and there is no time that we have failed to collect that money. The problem with rural telephone especially the telephone booths ,is vandalism.There have been xxx cases of telephone booths being broken into and once these booths are broken into, it is difficult to repair them. In any case the</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS ( Ctd):breaking into of these telephone booths has first to be reported to us before they can be repaired. This particular problem is also with us here in Nairobi^ and in other big towns® However, I would like to say. that it is also upon the hon. Members of this House to try and educate our people and to discourage them against this kind of vandalism. The Kenya Posts and Telecommunication'sprogramme is to make every district and every police station accessible bytelephone. In fact, by the turn of the century, we shall have practicallyall districts accessible .by telephone. So, in the next Development Programme for the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation, we intend to have all the districts connected with the Subscriber's Trunk Dialing system (s.T.D.) but that will cost a lot of money but this money will be worth spending. I would like to assure the hon. Members' that the money is being repaid by the Corporation as would be expected of itMr .Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I refer to are point which was raised by the Vice-President and the Minister for Home Affairs and this is about the xxx construction of access roads to the Nyayo tea zones. This was an important point and we have said that we shall tackle this it in conjuction with my colleague the Minister for Agriculture. This is because very soon now, we shall be picking that tea which will need to be taken to the factories or to the weighing centres. Therefore, this is a point which we shall consider.With regard to the roads leading to the North/Eastern Province, I would liketo say that fortunately, I have visited this whole area. In fact, I have practically visited every part of this country and v/hen hon. Members are addressing me, they xxx should know that I am aware of about 75per. cent of what they are talking about in their areas. I have been to Moyale,Marsabit, Handera, Garissa and so on5 in fact, more them four times. What weare tryijig to do now is to look for money for the construction of roads and			plans as well as designs for some of these s roeds to the north are ready. it has been difficult to find donors who would be willing to do fore-planning for the construction of these roads which we consider to be very important.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Ctd.):	Therefore, hon. Members from these areas should rest assured that wehave more or less now identified a possible donor I am not saying thatwe have already agreed with the donor, but we have identified him and if weagree, that road with be given priority in our[development plan. It isnot that we do not understand the importance of this road. I do not knowwhether the  access road to Kilimambogo College has been done. I havebeen there two or three times and one of the things I did was to ask ateam to look at the construction of this road. So, at least I am aware of this.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, there was also a point raised roads in Elgeyo Marakwet. I have made arrangements with the hon. Minister for Energy and REgional Development and we shall visit that area with my teamAnd perhaps this will be an opportunity for us to look some of the problems the Minister was referring to.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not want to take much time But all Iwant to say is that be itTaita Taveta, Machakos, Kakamega,Central Province or anywhere else, we have competent teams in the fields oEjvi I do not necessarily have to be at every spot nor the Permanent Secretarybefore work can be done. We rely on our field officers, be they m theMinistry or in the Corporations, to feed us with the necessary information. We expectthem to liaise with the hon. Members of this House to give then. the correct information so that when any issue is raised here, k hon. Members have the correct informationas it is on the ground, and we should not question that information. In some cases, we have had wrong information passed on to us and we have had to countercheck it with hon. Members and found it necessary to refer it back to the field. We trust that the information supplied by the hon Members of this House is always correct. we would like hon. Memberstherefore to help our officers in the field so that when it comes to presenting priority projects at the district development committees wherewe are represented, our people such as district engineers are involved in</Newspeech><Newspeech>TKE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND CDMMUNICATIONS (Ctd.):	determining and selecting roads which should be given priority in development.If this is done when these prioritices sre brought to Nairobi for transmission to the Treasury, there will be no question of saying that some are not the right priorities	or that they belong to less important areas.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (ctd.):Mr. Temporal Deputy Speaker, Sir, I want to make one point about transportation our people in this city and  in other towns His Excellency the President has done a lot of work in acquiring additional buses for city commuters. The longterm objective of the Government is to see that we  come up with a long-lasting metropolitan system of commuting by our workers. It is going to cost a lot of money and it cannot be achieved overnight. Studies and investigations are being done and I agree with hon. Members that the Kenya Bus Services Limited, matatu and private bus operators should be encouraged to ply their ± routes easily especially during peak hours. This is already being  done as earlier on, there used to be police checks during peak hours at around 7.30 a.m. and 8.00 a.m. . This is no longer happening because we do not want to inconvenience our own people. This is now being done at the convenience of ± both parties.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not want to take any more time. I only want to say</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I am wondering whether, before the Minister concludes his speech, he could refer to the point referred to by His Excellency the Vice-President and Minister for Home Affairs on the question of roads peeling off. He  was wondering whether there are people who are supposed to sign that the roads have been done properly before certificates of completion have .been issued, since roads peel off after a short 32 time of their completion.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMLItlNICATIONS (Mr. Magugu) Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will reply to that,by saying that when each stage of the road being built is completed, the contractor is given a certificate for the so many kilometers</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER POR TRANSPORT AHD COMMUNICATIONS (ctd.): competed. That certificate is certified by a resident engineer who is directly responsible to the Chief Engineer (Roads) who is directly responsible to the Permanent Secretary. I did not agree with what the Vice-President and Minister for Home Affairs said, though I did not want to say it. Those kinds of contractors do not continue to get jobs within the Ministry; they do not. I can assure this House that any certificate given dubiously is never passed. When roads are being designed, sometimes you find that a road has been designed for only for 40 or 50 cars per day light traffic. When the road becomes smoother by resurfacing or by tarmacking it with very light material because of the specification, and since when we build a road we do not say that certain kinds of vehicles should not pass through that road, then there comes a problem because since the road was not designed for that kind of heavy load, the road gets spoilt. That is what happens, and I would like hon. Shikuku and the hon. Vice-President and Minister for Home Affairs to know that. If we had the money, we could design roads which would last for 50 years. Today, we are not designing that kind of roads, we cannot afford it in our budget. I beg to move.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. KILIKU: On a point of order, Mr.Temporary DeputySpeaker, Sir. I want the Minister to put the record right.He said that the Kenya Bus Services Limited, matatu operators andprivate bus operators should be encouraged to operate in towns,but he knows very well that private but operators are not allowed,by law,to operate in town because of the monopoly of the Kenya Bus Services Limited. There was a Motion passed in this House which  	has not been implemented, which allowed private bus operators to operate in towns in view of the demand for such buses. Would he now clarify that point?</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AMD COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Magugu) : I thought the hon. Member was going to say that that point was also raised by His Excellency the President one time when he addressed the nation from the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport.

CHAIRMAN: On what page is it?</Newspeech>	.<Newspeech>MR. ANGATIA: On page 307. I refer to Head , Items 432, 444 and 446, and I want to compare these items. Item 432 is on the Minor Roads Improvement Programme. Apart from mere numbering, what is the difference between Item 432 and Item 444? I think there are different sums of money voted on the different items although they are under the same Head.I do not know whether I should ask two questions on the same issue.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHAIRMAN: Ho, lei us deal with that question first. There is enough time to ask the second one.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ANGATIA: So, do I ask one question at a time?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.

CHAIRMAN: No, it is Item 432. The question is on Items 432, 444 and 446 all of which talk about the Minor Road Improvement Programme.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Magugu): Mr. Chairman, Sir, Item 432 refers to the money controlled from the Headquarters. Then there is Item 444 which will be elaborate in Section III of the summary. As I said Item 432 refers to the Headquarters. Item 444 is a summary of funds for districts. This appears on page 333.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ANGATIA: Mr. Chairman, Sir, the lighting here is giving me a bit of a problem, and I cannot see the page the Minister is referring to.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. CHAIRMAN: If you refer to page 333, you will find Item 141 there, but a it actually begins on an earlier page. It begins on page 327. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ANGATIA: Mr. Chairman, Sir, do I understand that when I havegone through these districts, I will come to the total that is shown underItem 444? I have not had time to go through them, tut that is what I understand.If that is what is supposed to "be understood, why is the Minister spending somuch money on Item 432, the Headquarters? What is happening at the Headquarter so This is the Minor Roads Improvement Programme, and one might expect that all this money will be spent in districts,Why does this head have asmuch money as the Headquarters, Item 432? </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND CCKMUEICATI0N3 (Mr. Magugu): Mr. Chairman Sir, I do not want to go into the details of why there is so much  under Item 432, "because this must have been arrived at after some consideration. I am going to elaborate 6h:-Itemr444. The breakdown of this item is there.

I was just asking what items will take the money that is voted for under the Headquarters - a sum of £2,455,000. I want to know some of these items, and not everything.What are the items under which this money is going to be spent. This Minor Roads Improvement Programme is for the improvement of roads in rural areas On what is it going to be spent at the Headquarters?</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AM) CCMMUMCATIONS (Mr. Magugu.): Mr. Chairman Sir, we have public equipment, for example, the design of roads and Recurrent Expenditure.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ANuATIA: Mr.Chairman, Sir, we have the normal engineers, administrators, office and equipment that have been used to maintain roads in the couniry0 They are still there, but they are voted for under other items. So Minor Roads Improvement Programme funds ought to be in districts.When we go to the next page, 308, I see that the Rural Access RoadsProgramme appears here many times under Item 446. were told that the Minor Roads Improvement Programme was to replace the Rural Access Roads Programme.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ANGATIA (CTD.)If we are voting some more money under the Rural Access Roads Programme, are we now running both the programmes? Should we understand it that way? We have said here many times that we prefer the Rural Access Roads Programme, and the Minister has always insisted that he wants to replace it with the Minor Roads Improvement Programme, Here, he asks for money for both programmes. Are we going to run both of them concurrently or is one going to replace the other? If the latter is the case, why are we voting this money for the Rural Access Roads Programme? </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Magugu): Mr. Chairman, Sir, some of the money reflected here, as I said earlier, is for equipment for which we had to pay sales tax and duty That is why the figure appears to be higher. With regard to the second part of the question, I must say that we do not want to leave the projects half-way done. Therefore, we have to have a sensible conclusion of the programmes we are carrying out and therefore hence the amount of money requested. Subject to availability of funds we shall then start new projects as earlier on requested by hon. Members.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. ANGATIA: Mr. Chairman, Sir, can the Minister tell me the page where the details for this Rural Access Roads Programme money are shown so that I can see whether he is not duplicating  minor roads improvement programme in the same areas or even the same projectpossibly, with the Rural Access Roads Programme? There is a danger of voting money twice for the same project. .Let him show me the pages where this is broken down.</Newspeech><Newspeech> THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Magugu) : (Head 465 agreed to)(Sub-Vote 141 agreed to)(Head 450 agreed to)(Sub-Vote 142 agreed to)(Heads 466, 467 and 468 agreed to)(Sub-Vote 143 agreed to)(Head 457 agreed to)(Sub-Vote 144 agreed to)(Heads 460, 461, 462, 463, 464, 471, 473 and 477 agreed to) (Sub-Vote 145 agreed to) (Heads 472 and 476 agreed to) (Sub-Vote 147 agreed to) (Head 475 agreed to) (Sub-Vote 148 agreed to) (Vote D.14 agreed to) (Question put and agreed to) </Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRAIT SPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Magugu): Mr. Chairman, Sir, I beg to move that the Committee of Supply do report to the House its consideration of Vote 14, Ministry of Transport and Communications, and its approval thereof without  amendments.(Question put and agreed to)(Resolution to be reported without amendment)(The House resumed) [The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mutiso)' in the Chsdr]REPORTVote 14 - Ministry of Transport and Communications.MR. arap NG'ENY: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to report that the Committee of Supply has considered Vote 14 Ministry of Transport and Communications and approved the same without amendments.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. Magugu): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move that the House doth agree with the Committee in the said Resolution.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER, OFFICE OF THE ERE SI DMT (Mr. Onyanchaseconded. </Newspeech>(Question proposed) (Question put and agreed to)vr-3. 8.10.87<Header> MOTION </Header> THAT, this House resolves not to grant approval to the proposed Government guarantee of a loan to the Kenya Ports Authority as contained in Sessional Paper No.7 of 1987 laid on the Table on Jly 14, 1987.(Mr. Shikuku on 29.7.87)(Resumption'of Debate interrupted on 29.7.87)<Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, before I move this Motion I want to make two or three observations. One, I would like to inform the House, and the Ministry, that whatever I am going to say ±e here is in the interest of this nation, and being one of the custodians of the people's money in this Republic, it is my duty to do what I am going to do. First of all I would like to make it very clear to the Ministry, and the Minister himself in this House, that I am not moving this Motion with any sinister motive at all. To prove this I spentmy own money to travel from Butere to Nairobi and from Nairobi toMombasa, to see for myself what is being required that we guarantee. sHere I have got my air return ticket from Nairobi to Mombasa and	jMombasa to Nairobi and I will lay it on the Table. I spent my own money to go and see what the Minister wants us to approve or guarantee. When I went to Mombasa I started inspecting berth Nos. 11, 12, 13, 14 and web± moved farther to berths Nos. 16, 17 and 18. What I saw is that berths 16,17 and 18 had been modernised. The floor, was made hard enough for the containers and those big cranes which off-load and load the containers. But berths 11 to 14, for which the Minister is asking this House to approve a loan to the tune of KShs.93 million, are in horrible conditions.MR. SHIKUKU (ctd);	I do not have to go into the niceties and so on. But I am going to use the ordinary man’s description of what I saw.These berths are sort of parking bays for the ships. Since there is concrete on your left and water on your right normally they have some huge boards and some rubbers which act as shock absorbers. These are placed between the concrete and the ship which is berthed. They prevent the ship from knocking against the concrete and damaging itself. But to my surprise, right from berth 11 to 18 everything had gone rotten. There was hard steel which the ships knocked against when they berthed. This damages the ships. I am sure that Kenya Ports Authority must have received complaints from ship owners because the sides of their ships must have been damaged. I then realised that there is a need for a Motion like this one. But then0why do I move this Motion urging the House not to approve this guarantee of loan to the Kenya Ports Authority? It is because I am conscious of the fact that we have a law in this country which is known as The Guarantee loans Act, Cap.461 of laws of Kenya.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU (ctd.):If you look at Section 5(ii),it says:"Before giving any guarantee under Section 3,	the Minister shall prepare and lay before the National	Assembly a Sessional Paper specifying the covenant, the	due performance of which is to be guaranteed and where	the covenant is for repayment of a, loan, the amount of	                       the loan, the terms and conditions as to the interest and repayment in respect of the loan, the Government	:total contingent liability under guarantee given under	this Act and any further information which the Minister	considers relevant".	fMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir5 what was laid on the Table of this House on the	said date I have read in the Motion; Section 3 of that guaranteesays:-		"A loan has been secured from the European Investment Bank for financing repair, rehabilitation	!and new construction of berths 11 to 14 Shimanzi Old	Terminal, Kipevu Terminal in the Tort of Mombasa, as more particularly described in append is attached hereto".To show how some of our brothers can be careless in performing their duties asrequired by law, the Minister was supposed to lay a complete paper on this Tablebut he did not do so. He refers to an appendix which was supposed to be attachedto whatever he laid on the Table, but there was no appendix. I got this documentfrom the Library and I thought that after having been laid on this Table, theappendix disappeared. Well, the Librarian told me that this is all she had of the Paper laid on the Table. I went further to the Clerk's Chambers and checked because when you lay any paper here, it is filed in the file for Papers Laid on the Table. I found exactly what the Librarian had. In other words, what I am saying is that when the Minister laid the Sessional Paper, he forgot to lay the appendix. That is a terrible mistake, and we should not accept such serious mistakes like this on a Paper which is supposed to be a legal document if not challenged within seven days after it has been laid on the Table. </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, Section 5(ii); where I come in, says:“Where a Sessional Paper has been laid before the National Assembly in pursuance of this Section, the proposed guarantee to which the Paper relates shall be deemed to have been approved by the National Assembly</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU (ctd.):unless, within seven days on which the Assembly next sits after the Paper has been laid before the National Assembly, a Member of the National Assembly gives his notice of his intention to move a Motion that the proposed guarantee be not approved or that it be referred to a Select Committee of the Assembly".It is under that provision that I stand here, and that is why I moved this Motion,to give reasons why I should oppose the guarantee of this loan. First of all, whydo I oppose the guarantee of this loan? I oppose the guarantee of this loanbecause of the reasons I shall be giving as I go on. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as stated in the Sessional Paper laidon this Table, Section 9 says:-"The current contingent liability of the Govern¬ment in respect of guarantees under Section 3 of the Guarantees Loan Act, Cap.461, amounts to K£499,550,653".Therefore, if we approve this loan, the current contingent liability of the Govern¬ment of Kenya Trill go up to K£504,200,653 I was just wondering why s we shouldgo deeper into debts, and then it occurred to me to remember the English sayingthat once beaten, twice shy. The.hon. Members who were in this House at the timethe Sessional Paper was laid on the Table must be blamed because they did not dotheir job. Unfortunately, I was not here. Once a Minister lays a Paper on theTable, it is p upon the Members of Parliament, particularly the Back-benchers, tofind out what has been laid on the Table and challenge it or support it. I nowchallenge this Sessional Paper because, as I shall enumerate, we have had a fewSessional Papers laid on the Table and not challenged, resulting into seriousfinancial blows to the Government. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, Ken-Ren was established under  No. 7 of 1975 Sessional Paper/whichwas laid on the Table. Sir, you know where I was at thattime.</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: Where were you?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKDKIT: I was in detention.</Newspeech><Newspeech>AS HON. MEMBER: Why?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MS. SHIKUKU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, thio Sessional Paper was not challenged by anybody at that time, And do you know what happened? A sum of K2382 million was guaranteed, and we all know what happened to Ken-Ren. All that money has gone to the drain. Another Sessional Paper was laid on this Table in connexion with the Kisumu Molasses Complex in 1978, and a sum of E£440,440 was lost, Nobody challenged that Sessional Paper and we all km? know what happened. Another Sessional Paper was laid on the Table- of this House in respect of the Kenya Fibre Corporation in 1978, and we all know what happened to the E£7,938,000; it all went down the drain.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. AEUYA-ABUYA: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. The hon. Member assumes that we know what happened. Could he enlighten the House EH as to what happened so that he does not leave us hanging in the air?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKOKU; Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thought that everybody knew what happened to Ken-Ren.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am finding it very difficult to balance all these  documents I have in my hands. In the past we used to speak from the Table because it is very difficult for one to hold all these documents. I have to go to the Table.</Newspeech><Newspeech>Aft HON. MEMBER: You had better walk there. </Newspeech>(Hon. Shikuku moved to the Table of the House)			|MR, SHIKUKU (Contd.):	=	jSir, I thought that hon0 Members know because this has been	j in the Public Accounts Committee Report many times. So, I thought itis common knowledgee For instance. Ken Ren, Kisumu Molasses, Kenya jjFurfural Company, I(Sh055,844,000/-, Kenya Fibre Corporation,	j!KSh.7,938,OOO/-s Kenya Furfural Company'S Sessional Paper was laid jon the Table, as I said earlier, on 13th September, 1977, It was	a loan guarantee for Kenya Furfural Company. No hon. Member challenged it. You can see what happened. The amount of the loan is already	 state do In January, 1983, it was put under receivership. In 1986,the second Sessional Paper No,5, which I have also moved a Motion to stop the payment of this money was laid on the Table. It is amongithose which have to be paid because we guaranteed it. All this comes From the taxpayer’s money					Then, Sir, there is another sessional Paper which was laid on the	Table again. This is about Halalal Meat Company.</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr, Mutiso) : Order, Shikuku I For clarification, does it mean that all these guarantees of the various companies you have just read out all were placed under receivership, or it is only one company?</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR, SHIKUKU: All the ones I am giving are the ones where	"we have completely lost money, I am only giving an example0 There are many other "Halalals", So, I said this time, let me look around. Why should we give this guarantee?" I think time has come when cur Constitution or whatever law should be amended so that whenever Government guarantees any loan, we become a part of it A Select Committee of his House must be involved in the negotiations, and also making sure that we are committing ourselves to something that is viable, and not to something that is going to "eat" the taxpayers money. We have always given a "blank cheque", and this is what we are now getting. Time has come when we must change the system.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUIOJ (Contd.):Sir, I went ahead one! said, all right. These people want the money0 Are they able to pay it without getting the loan? I went  and pickcd up on the Kenya Ports Authority. These are not hon. Shiloiku books. "Kenya Ports Authority   Annual Report and Accounts for the period 1st January to 31st December, 1985". This is gust to give you a rough ideaHere, Sir, on page 10, you will find revenue, including thenet revenue receipts for the year 1985 is KSh.l,352.9 million,, Thenworking expenses less debt services shows KSh„l,000.6 millions Thenthe interesting part comes0 After doing all that, net earning of theKenya Ports Authority was KSh.352.3 million. Then debt reserving charges were KSh.122.5 million Other charges came to KSh.13.8 million. Now, balance surplus even if you do not know accounting  KSh.2l6 million! why do you want to borrow only KSh.93 million? You have a balance surplus of KSh.2l6 million I We could even make it without a loan because on this paper the Minister says or the Guarantee loan Phase the total cost of the project is 12.2 million (iqus) whatever that means  but it is put between brackets (equivalent to KSh.l88.9 million). Now, even if you do not know mathematics, Sir, if you have a balance surplus of KSh02l6 million, and the whole project costs KSh.l88.9 million, if you substract that from KSh.2l6 million, you still have a surplus balance of some million shillings! Now, why do you borrow?(applause) 		 _Not only that They Talk about "investments”. This body is not broke. They generate money and they feel that it should not be kept in the banks, but it should be invested in other area so "Investments” is KSh.544.4 million. Whom do they give this money to? You will get M/S Thabiti Company, Transnational Bank, Estate Building Society,</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU (Contd.):Pan Africa Bank, Pioneer Building Society and so on Even, some of those who have died, they are still given the money. Then one wondersHow do you want to borrow when you can lend? Even some of the moneyis "eaten" by some funny banks which drop by the wayside,Nov Sir. the356110w here the accounts, and I have given hon. Members this copy. They show the interest and the date you were given the loan0 These are short-term balances For the information of the hon. Members, in this paper I have laid on the Table, they have all matured The latest matured on 21st July, 1987, and the rest matured in 1986, to the tune of KSh.l59,072,955-75 The money was returned and they can re-invest it again. Why do we want this money?Sir, again, I went further, and got hold of a book called "The Kenya Ports Authority  Approved, Revised, 1986/87  Operating Revenue and Expenditure Budget", When the Minister was moving the Vote the other day, he said that these things will require this loan for repairs and modernising facilities which I physically went and saw My witness is an Assistant Minister for Environment and Natural Resources, hon.Shariff Nassir,and hon. Dr, Chibule with whom we travelled. The way I travelled there might be very interesting, and we should not have very serious debate hers. We should entertain ourselves a bit. The way I went there, nobody could make it out because I had a big kanzu, and the Moslem kofia. I put it on, rather too close to my face. No one knew who J. was, So, I went on moving like an ordinary, innocent Mswahili as "Sheikh Martin", from Berth 11 to 13, and nobody knew me.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU (ctd):Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, after I finished my homework, I met lion. iJacsir and hon. Dr. Chibule in the  V.I.P loungo. Oh my way back to Nairobi, it took hon. Hassir three minutes to find out who the other guy who was sitting there was. He looked and looked and he was wondering: Which Sheikh is this?" The only thing I did not have is the black cloth the Sheikhs tie on their heads; otherwise I should have been complete. He cams nearer had a close look and said: "Oh God! Wewe ni mhe. Shikuku?" I greeted him: "Taib Taib, Salaasi Aleikum" na kadhalika. Those arc the witnesses who say me. I  did that at my own cost because I wanted to carry out research and get the truth for the wananchi of this country.I am not opposing this thing  What I am opposing is that there isno need to into any further debt thereby mortgaging my children; the children of every hon. Member in this House and the children all Kenyans here, into debt. We should only borrow when it is completely necessary. Prom these facts  and I am going to further to give you descriptions  you find that there is no need for us to borrow at all and thereby, save our children. This is because borrowing £504 million is a lot of money Hon. Members in this House and I, would be failing miserably and hopelessly in performing their duty of safeguarding the tax-payer's interest in this country. That is what we are elected for. We are elected here to safeguard the interests of those who elected us into this House. I am only doing; my duty which I am supposed to do as by law established and which I swore to do.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I would like to go further by say.ingthat in this Budget, every year, they have what we call depreciation. I amnot an accountant, but those who studied accounts can understand. Every yearthere is depredation and there is a certain amount set aside to repair thesethings. The Minister himself said - and it can be checked 21 from the HANSARD that since 1952, these repairs have never taken place and these berths are inhorrible conditions. I agree with the Minister because I saw them. I am sure that the Kenya Ports Authority must be paying for some damages to the ship owners.MR. SIHKUKU (ctd).	who have had their ships bally scratched by those terrible, rotton</Newspeech>(Mr. Shikuku looked at the Civil Servants Bench) <Newspeech>THE MINISTER F0R TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATION(Mr. magugu): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Can the hon. Member address himself to the Chair instead of addressing himself to the Civil Servants Bench over there? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHEKUKU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, you can look in any direction and I would like the hon. Minister to tell me under what Standing Order it is stated that when you are speaking, you must look at the Speaker  and not elsewhere. I think time has come, when some of my hon. friends in this House should respect me. I am very versed with Parliamentary Procedures and Standing Orders. They should, therefore, respect me and give me that due. Even I was respected the other day for my services in the Commonwealth Par¬liamentary Association and I came back with, a silver medal.(Applause)I was given a silver medal in recognition of- my service to the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association . They recognised me but here I am only pushed aside because they do not like my guts but they have to live with me. I know them and I know more than they do. Sir, I am addressing the Chair and I can look anywhere I want. I can even look at this and that way and I am free to do so. I am more senior to all these hon. Members seated here; none of them has been elected into this House continuously without, lossing in the elections I can teach them that.The other point I would like to say is that when you look at this book I am holding</Newspeech><Newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR RESEARCH, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (Mr. Ayah): Is there anything more boring than this? </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I can hear the new Minister for Research, Science and Technology asking: Is there anything more boring than this? If there is any boring person, it is that new Minister called " Mr. Ndolo Ayah.</Newspeech>(Laughter)<Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: Ignore him. </Newspeech><Newspeech>MR.SETFCUICLT: Yes, I will ignore him. Thank you. Mr. TemporaryDeputy Speaker, Sir, depreciation is there and it is always provided for.Even this "building we have here, we have to repaint it, put new carpets andso on. All these expenses are normally provided for. How, Sir, I would liketo draw your attention to page 35 of "the Approved Revised Operating Revenueand Expenditure Budgets 1986/87. It says that depreciation provided forfor 1985/87 is £4,709,650. This is for this year. Since 1952 as the hon.Minister said, it has always been there. Why did they not repair the berths;why did they not repair these things when they  were breaking? Why did theynot service these things until the expenses accumulated to £93 million?What happens to that money which is always provided? I know that they willtell me: "We put this money into a saving and that is why we have that surplusand God knows what. Why do you keep money when you see things going wrong?We are told later: Oh! because of this state of affairs, ships are nowgoing to other ports because our berths are so bad and we are now lossingbusiness.” This is taking place when we have money provided for every yearto do the repairs. Would I be wrong if I attributed that to laziness ofthe officers charged with the duty of repairing these berths and yet theywant my son and daughter to go further into debts. A person who is in debts is never free. You are not free once youbecome a slave of that man or woman who gave you the money. To be independent,we must take into account how free and solvent we are and then we can speak with ourchests out. But when you are going round begging and when you have to go andcry: "Sir, I thought I could service this thing, but because of this, I am notable to do so. Please, can you extend the period we had agreed?" When you dothis, you will have lost your manhood and your dignity. Since we won Independencewe would like to be respected and to speak with dignity and not go round tip-toeing and rather humble begging.I am one of those who believe in that as a person. I am able and Ido not go tip-toeing. That is Mr. Shikuku ,Speaker freely: he does not careabout anybody. I do not owe anybody anything. I will tell him the truth</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU (ctd):and if it hurts him, he will go home and I will also go home. I will speak my mind and that is why I am enjoying my freedom of speech. This is because I do not have worry that if I said this, then my boss who gave this and that, will stop it and I will go dry. No nay, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU (ctd.):Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, that is why I speak with all theconfidence of the people of Butere and Kenya as a whole and they respect me.However, I also want them to be able to move freely. When I stand in anyinternational meeting, they respect me and say, Here is a person who comes from Government that is solvent, a Government of dignity!, and they listen to me. 	However it cannot go on like this when we are moving up in debt.</Newspeech><Newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER We are moving down and not up!</Newspeech>	<Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I hear an hon..Member here telling me that we are moving down and not up when I know thatwe have moved from £499 million to £505 million in debt. We are notgetting any better. We should now be coming down to zero.Another point, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, is that when we go into too much indebtedness The amount of money that the Kenya Ports	Authority is paying for what they call funding charges for the year in questionis Shs.125,655,700/- When we approve this loan, this figure must go up say must we do that, and yet we have the money? In view of the fact that some of the money has been returned, They can stop this because this was a short-term programme and could have been able to do this job withoutborrowing money at all. When I give you a loan on a short-term basis, andyou then want to renew it, I would then say, No, I want the money. So,we can use this money. There is no need at all to borrow this money.Another point,Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, which I wouldlike to draw to your attention regarding Is our borrowing money from overseas,is that we have a funny situation in the Republic of Kenya where we need moneyand we have to borrow it from outside, yet we ourselves have a lot of out moneyoutside Kenya. I, Joseph Martin Shikuku son of Oyondi, lose nominute in this House to tell the nation that cur money is being siphoned and  iS going outside Today, we have the Shs.600 million which has been taken away as we are talking here. I congratulate the president for</Newspeech><Newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU (ctd.):	I enjoyed when he was talking and I watched him speaking all the time andI noticed he vas shoving his teeth. You know he only smiles, but yesterday, I saw his teeth which can damage these crooks who are siphoning money from this country when we need it so badly here.I have no doubt that those who are responsible of siphoning moneyout of this country will appear before the courts. Let them be squeezed toget the money from outside and then put them into prison. A certain Mhindi friend of miney told me that they love ghee so much that even if a fly drops into the ghee, they do not pour the ghee. He told me that they remove the fly but not in a hurry, least the fly goes away with some of the ghee. So, they normally get hold of it and shake it to make sure that it does not fly off with some of the ghee. You do not throw away the ghee when you throw away the fly. When the fly goes, you remain with the ghee. I want the same thing to be done to these people who are siphoning money out of this country.	 Therefore, I support His Excellency the President in what he has doneThese people have fallen into the "ghee”. Let us not just throw them away Let us get B hold of them, squeeze and shake them and when we make sure they have no more "ghee", we can then throw them into prison. That is what should be done.</Newspeech><Header> ADJOURMENT</Header> <Newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Mutiso): Hon.
