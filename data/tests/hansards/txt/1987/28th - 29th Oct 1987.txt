KLLIKU asked the Minister for Local Government:-(a)	what is delaying the opening of Chaani Market which has been built through the World Bank project of site and service scheme; and(b)	whether he will take the necessary action to have this market opened.newspeechnewspeechMR. SPEAKER: Is anyone here from the Ministry of Local Government? (Question deferred)newspeechQuestion No. 455newspeechMR. arap KOSKS asked, the Minister for Lands and Settlement(a)	whether he is aware that a Mr.K.A. Mitei, of P.O Box 4, Kericho, surrendered his land to Kipsigis Girls High School in exchange for another piece of land near Kapasacs Trading Centre in 1981;(b)	whether he is further aware that Mr Mitei has not been able to secure a title deed for the land he wasgiven in exchange for his own land; and(c)	what action he is taking to ensure that the complainant is given the title deed.newspeechheaderTHE MINISTER FOR LANDS AND SETTLEMENTheader newspeech (Mr. Nyakiamo): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply,(a)	I am aware that Mr. K.A. Mitei surrendered a piece of land he was occupying for the expansion of Kipsigis Girl3 High School in exchange for another piece of land.(b)	I am also aware that Mr. Mitei has not been able to secure a title deed for the alternative piece of land(c)	Mr. Mitei and four others who were affected by the extension  of the school were to be compensated with alternative land that was to be donated through the Government by Ms Brooke Bond Liebig (K) Ltd Since the plots to settle these people in were to be excised from two big farms owned by the above private company, it became necessary to obtain clearance from both the Land Control Board and the County Council of Kipsigis.The portion which Mr. Mitei got comprised of two adjacent parcelsof land in L.R.Nos. 6121R and 7282R It became, therefore, necessary for the two parcels of land to be consolidated first in order to issue him with a single title deedThis protracted process has now been completed and arrangements are underway to issue the title deed within the next three weeks.newspeechnewspeechMR.arap KOSKE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while thanking the Minister for that very good answer, could he tell the House how much land was given to this complainant now that it has been surveyed?newspeechGGN	newspeechMR. Nyakiamo: Mr.  Speaker, Sir, there are five people who are concerned involved with this matter and there are 26 acres of land to be divided among them I cannot however. tell the hon. Member how many acres Mr. Kipkoech arap Leting has got, or how many acres Mr. Kipkoech arap Chepgorus,  or Mr. Chepkwany arap lesoi or Mr.Viproto arap mitei has  got but we can find the details later.newspeech newspeechMR. MUTHURA:  Mr. Speaker, Sir, could the Minister tell the House whether there was any agreement, signed between Mr. Mitei and  either the person who was to surrender the land or the Government, or it was just something which was said verbally?newspeechnewspeechMR. NYAKLAMOs Mr. Speaker, Sir, in my reply, I said  that they were to be given alternative lan__d through the Government because the Government had asked the Brooke Bond Lfcibig( Limited to give us the land. The gist of the matter is that the Provincial Administratinn had approached MS Brooke Bond  (K) Limited with a request to donate a piece of land for expansion of Kipsigis Girls High School. Since the company did not own any land near the school, it undertook to compensate people owning land adjecent to the school with alternative land if they were willing to surrender  it for the expansion of the school. That is why the Government came to agreement and  that is why the five people got alternative land.newspeechnewspeechMR. MUTISO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, would the Minister tell the House the  acreage of the to said pieces of land which were taken over by the Government for the extension  of this School from these individuals, and whether the Government will return the same number of acreage to the said people?newspeechnewspeechMR. NYAKIAMO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thought I replied to that question when I said that the acres concerned are 26 but I cannot tell exactly  the acreage each individual is getting, but obviously, it will be equal to what they had given.newspeech	Question No.583newspeechMR. MUNYAO asked the Minister for Labour(a) whether he is aware that a Mr. Paul Mutiso Kitavi, who was employed by Masaku County Council fell down on 22nd July, 1979, and sustained very serious back injuries;(b)	whether he is further aware that Mr. Kitavi is permanently incapacitated and that he has never been paid . compensation; and(c)	whether he will direct that Mr. Kitavi be paid compensation without further delay.newspeechheaderTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LABOUR headernewspeech (Mr.arap Metto) : Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(a)	I am aware that Mr. Paul Mutiso Kitavi, a former employee of Masaku County Council, fell down sometime in 1979 and sustained back injuries but it  has not been ascertained that the accident arose during and in the course of his employment(b) I am aware that Mr.Paul Mutiso Kitavi is incapacitated to the tune of 5 per cent incapacity and that he has never been paid compensation.(c)	I am legally unable to direct that Mr. Kitavi be paid Workmens Compensation because the accident was not reported to the District Labour Officer, Machakos, until November, 1985 . despite the fact that the accident occurred in 1979. The Workmens Compensation Act, Cap.236 requires that an accident be reported within a period of three years from the date of the accident.newspeechnewspeechMR. MUNYAO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am  surprised that the Assistant Minister says he is aware and that he cannot ascertain that the accident occurred in the course of Mr.Kitavi carrying out his employment duties. What else would it mean if Mr. Kitavi was an employee of the county council and he fell within the county council hall working? What other proof does the Assistant Minister want? He fell while working.newspeechnewspeechMR. arap METTO Mr. Speaker Sir, according to the information that I have from my field officers, they have not been able to ascertain whether this. accident occurred at the place of work.newspeechnewspeechMR. MUNYAO On a. point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister in order to  refuse to answer a direct  question? In answering part (a) of the Question; he accepted that Mr. Kitavi was injured. Mr. Kitavi was injured while working where he was employed What was the Assistant Minister then coming here to reply if at first he did not ascertain that?newspeechnewspeechMR. arap METTO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the information given by the hon. Member is  correct  then maybe if the hon. Member can give us proof that this accident happened there  an accident can happen elsewhere  information that I have in the office does not indicate that. Up to this particular moment, until somebody proves me wrong with facts that this happened in the county council hall, then I do not see  how I can now agree with the hon. Member? if he has any other way of proving that the accident occured there, then I may accept to investigate further so that I can take the necessary action.newspeechnewspeechMR. OMIDO Mr. Speaker. Sir, the former employee has told the hon. Member that he fell in the county council hall. The Assistant Minister also agrees that he is aware. Is the Assistant Minister then in order to say that he wants further proof when .newspeechnewspeechMR. MID (Ctd.) : the employee concerned has informed the hon. Member who is nowtelling the House that that is the position? Is he really in order to say that? What further evidence does he want; is it not sufficient for the hon. Member to say that I know because I was informed by the employee concerned?newspeechnewspeechMR. arap METTO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, all that I said is that I am aware that this employee had an accident. But the only tiling that I did not say that I am aware Of is where this accident occurred. Now the hon. Member is telling the House that this occurred in the county council hall. If that is true, then may I be given more time to ascertain or to investigate further because according to the information that I have, they are not able to tell exactly whether this accident occurred there.newspeechnewspeechMR. OMIDO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Minister told the house that according to the assessment the incapacity was 5 percent. If I understood him properly, is he in order to say 5 per cent incapacity because in my understanding of the Workmens Compensation Act does contradicts the Assistant Ministers answer. This is Permanent injury, cannot be 5 percent incapacity.newspeechnewspeechMR. arap METTO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the information I have indicates that i am aware  that Mr. Kitavi is incapacitated to the tune of 5 per cent That is the information that I have and I have also said that it was due to an accident. All that I am  saying is that this matter took a long time before it was reported to my labour officer in the district. As I have indicated, the accident occurred in.1979 and it was reported to my labour office in 1985; so you can imagine all that time.newspeechnewspeechMR.SPEAKER: Next Question.meomido On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.newspeechnewspeech MRs SPEAKER: No We  are running short of time and we must move on. Let us go to Mr.wakiondos Question.newspeechQuestion No.62newspeechMR. WAKEONDO asked the Minister for Labour why Mr. Julius Gitundu Kirebu, ID No.77297817, former employee of Kenya Canners Company Limited, Thika, PNo 51667, employed in Plant Department Irrigation Section A 94 was dismissed on 31st February, 1981 without any warning letter immediately on his return from leave.newspeechEND BheaderTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LABOUR headernewspeech (Mr. arap Metto): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.According to the information available to my Ministry, Mr. Julius Gitundu Kirebu, who was a former employee of Kenya Canners Company Limited, deserted his job with effect from 17th December, 1981 and therefore the question of his dismissal on 31st December, 1981, does not arise.Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the hon. Member for Meru South East has contrary information on this case, he should be kind enough to provide the same to me so that my Ministry could carry out further investigations on this case.newspeechnewspeechHR.WAKIONDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the answer given by the Assistant Minister surprises me. This young man was an employee of Kenya Canners Company Limited, Thika, and after working for a year he was given his annual leave. When he came back from his 21 days leave he was told to back home. That is the information I have and I would like the Assistant Minister to take into consideration and carry out further investigations into this matter.newspeechnewspeechMR. arap METTO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have already stated in my reply to this Question, if the hon. Member has any document that proves that this young man was given his annual leave he should submit it to my Ministry because it will assist me to carry out further investigations If the hon Member gives me a letter or a document of that kind to show that the young man was given leave then I will make further investigations.newspeechnewspeechMR. LUKINDO: Mr. Speaker Sir, since the Assistant Minister says that his Ministry does not know exactly what happened to this young man could he tell this House what steps his Ministry has taken so far? What steps has the Assistant Minister taken after the submission of this Question to his Ministry.newspeechnewspeechMR. arap METTO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have already said that according to the information, available to my Ministry Mr. Julius Gitundu Kirebu Who is a former employee of Kenya Canners Company limited deserted his job The hon. Member is aware that when an employee deserts his job there is absolutely nothing the Ministry can do. This is because the employee himself deserted his job But if the hon. Member can-prove to me.newspeechnewspeechMR. LUEINDO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Apart from the information the Assistant Minister has, I think he i not answering this supplementary question. Apart from the information he has received from his officers what has the Ministry done? I ask this question because the information he has might be misleading.newspeech	newspeechMR. arap METTO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the investigation we have carried out as a Ministry has revealed to us that the employee deserted his job. When a person deserts his job there is nothing the Ministry can do about it. But if the hon. Member can assist by giving us a letter of some kind to prove that this employee was granted 21 days leave we will definitely take the necessary action.newspeechnewspeechMR. KHALI E: Mr.Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Labour is an important Ministry in the sense that it takes care of the welfare of workers in this country. But from the answers being given by the Assistant Minister it appears that his Ministry relies on information given by the employers themselves. This is because whenever Questions are put to the Ministry of Labour the answers given by the Ministry are answers which have obviously been prepare by the employers themselves. Can the Assistant Minister employ a different machinery, which is going to  be fair, to establish the truth about the numerous cases affecting workers in this country?newspeechnewspeechMR. arap METTO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is not true that we always rely on what the employers tell us. In fact we have labour officers in every district So, whenever problems of this nature arise the workers are free to report their comlaints to the district labour offices and our officers there will take the necessary action. At the same time we have trade unions whose main duty is to take care of the interests of workers in the country. The workers members of these trade unions. We also have the Kenya Industrial Court where every Party is given a chance to be heard So, it is not fair, and it is not true, for the hon. Member to say that we in the Ministry rely only on information given to us by the employers.newspeech newspeechMR, SPEAKER: Mr. Mwachofi s Question.newspeechnewspeechMR. MWACHOtl: Bw.

Spika, naomba kujibu.(a)	Katika nchi yote nzima kuna maofisa-elimu 322 na walimu 9,377. Katika wilaya ya Taita Taveta peke yake sasa kuna maofisa wanne baada ya mmoja wao kujiuzulu hivi majuzi na kujipatia kazi katika kundi lisilo la Serikali. Ofisa mwingine atapelekwa huko mar a moja baada ya Tume ya kuajiri watumishi wa Serikali itakapomaliza kazi ya kuzijaza nafasi zilizotangazwa hivl majuzi katika Idara ya Elimu. ya Watu Wazima.

Maofisa hao wako chlni ya mpangomaaluia unaoonyesha wazi kiwango cha kuingilia pamoja na masharti na mahitaji ya kupaniishwa cheo katika kazi yao. Yakubalika lakini, kuwa walimu wa watu wazima bado hawana mpango wa utumishiWalimu hao wam_ekuwa waki jielimisha kwa mafunzo ya maafikano, yaani correspondence, na kundi la kwanza litamaliza masomo yao mwezi Aprili mwaka ujao. Majadiliano yanaendelea kati ya Wizara ya Utamaduni na Huduma za Jamii na Chuo cha Elimu kuhusu madaraka na maendeleo ya walimu hawa.(c)	Hakuna hitilafu sasa kati ya mishahara ya maofisa-elimu ya watu wazima na wale wa Wizara ya Elimu. Tofauti zilizokuwapo ziliondolewa mwezi wa Mei, 1986, kwa kupandishwa cheo kwa maofisa-elimu wasaidizi (Assistants Adult Education Officers) kutoka kiwango cha "G" hadi kiwango cha "H".newspeechnewspeechMR. MWACHOFI: Bw.

Kwa hivyo, vile mhe Mwachofi anavyosema alijibiwa, ilikuwa ni kweli, lakini mishahara ilikuwa inafanana kwa gredi zile zilizoko chini ya Gredi H Kuhusu habari wanazoziuliza sasa nimesena kuwa kuna inpango wa scheme of service ambayo iko sasa.newspeechnewspeechMR. MUTISO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I think the  Assistant Minister is not being fair to this House becuase the Question which was put to him was very specific, In June, 1985, the Assistant Minister, who was then in the Ministry of Culture and Social Services, said in this House that there was no difference between the adult education officers and those in the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology in terms of salaries, but now he tells this House that the effect of change took place in May, 1986- when these officers were removed from.newspeech	newspeechMR.

MUTHuRA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister in order to insinuate that the hon. Member could have his own views? It is not a question of views, but  question of policy. Is he in order to as mislead the House?newspeechnewspeechMR. MICHUKI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is very evident that there is varied opinion. Yaani kuna maoni ambayo yanato fautiana.

MUTHUBA asked the Minister for Information and Broadcasting whether he could reinstate the showing of  factual and developmental files to wananchi especially now that a lot of development has taken place all over the country.newspeechheaderTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFORMATION  AND BROADCASTING headernewspeech (Mr. Khasakhala): Mr. Speaker. Sir, I beg to reply.The question of reinstatement of showing of factual and developmental films to wananchi does not arise since it had never been stopped before and it continues even today.newspeechnewspeechMR. MUTHGRA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the Assistant Minister telling lis. the House that the Ministry shows these films continuously and all over the country?newspeechnewspeechMR. KHASAKHALA: Yes, Sir. In every province  have a cinema van. The cinema van for Rift Valley Province is based at Nakuru, These cinema vans go round the districts in a province covering films on factual, developmental, educational, political, economical and cultural activities of this nation. In 1985 "the unit based at IJakuru showed films at 2s anyuki, Subili and the surrounding areas. In 1986, the ji unit screened films in three centres in Laikipia District includir. Hanyuki area. In 1987, the unit has screened films at Rumuruti on 5th August, Subili on 7th August, 1987 and Durumo on 8th August, 1987. The film shows screened during that period included Mult Literacy, The Burning Spear, Twenty Great Years of Uhuru, A Man of the People, Agriculture After Independence, Watering the ITation, Family Planning, Nyayo Path, Partner in Progress and others.newspeechnewspeechMR. MUTHURA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister has enumerated several films which were screened. Can he be specific and tell the House, and the people of Eanyuki, the particular film which was screened at Kanyuki arid "the particular date of the month when it was screened 1987 ?newspeechnewspeechMR. KHASAKHALA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I cannot give the title of the filmE.2.28.1.87.which was screened at Nanyuki, but I have already given the date  the film was screened. However, if he wants me to give the title of the film, I can still get that information from my  Ministry.E.3. 28.1.87.newspeechMR. MUTHDEA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as far as I am concerned, what I haveseen are films which are screened by. Cinema Leo, some churches and other advertisingcompanies. I do not remember seeing a van belonging to the Ministry of Informationand Broadcasting showing any film in Nanyuki during the particular time theAssistant Minister has talked about. Of course, I have the date for 1987 when hesaid a film was screened in Nanyuki, but I wanted him to be very particular andmention the  title of the film, where it was shown and the date it was schown.newspeechnewspeechMR. KHASAKEALA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, 1987 is not yet ended. In fact, weare still in the process of going round the districts in Rift Valley Province. IfNanyuki requires a film show, the hon. Member can raise that point in  his districtdevelopment . committee and, since the Ministry is represented in the districtdevelopment committee, I am sure that my officers will be very much willing toscreen a film at Eapyuki.newspeech	newspeechMR. MUTEURA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister is now referring me to the district development committee. He is now talking about the future when, in fact, I am talking about the past, then he says that a film was screened in Nanyuki and then refers  me to the district development committee for future screening, is he not misleading the House? VWN	F.1. 23.1.87 newspeech newspeechMR. KHASAKIIALA: Mr. Speaker, Sir he asked me about 1987, and that is why I said that 1987 is not yet over, and that is why I referred him to the future. Otherwise, the films have been in progress and they have been showing through out the districts.newspeechnewspeechMR. Mathence: Mr. Speaker, Sir, arising from that answer given by the Assistant Minister, we know that these films are supposed to educate wananchi on the Government policies, as he has just said. He has  mentioned areas in my Constituency such asRimuruti, Subili and Durumo, and he has even mentioned the dates whenthese films were   shown, but these films were not advertised: nobody saw them. So, I do not know how these films came, or when they came, they were brought secretly. Even my people did not knowabout them. The films were brought to educate us, but they camesecretly so the people were not educated. I have no date for these films, so newspeechnewspeechMR. SPEAKER: Order!

MEMBER: That is not a point of order. MR. SPEAKER: No, that is not your business! You should not shout like that.newspeechnewspeechMR. KIKUYU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. When the Assistant Minister was answering, a supplementary question, he told the Member of Parliament for Laikipia East to go to the district development committee (D.D.C.) and tell them to inform the district information officer of the arrangements that they would like as concerns the screening of films Was he in order to say that, whereas this is a duty of the Government to inform and educate the  people? It should not be planned by the D.D.C. It is the Ministry which should inform and educate the people in the rural areas so that they know  what the Government wants, and know the Government policies; It is not the D.D.C.s- which should do this. Why should he  refer us back to D.D.C.s for issues that do not concern  them?newspeechnewspeechMR. KHASAXHALA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, D.D.C.s are part of the Government, and my Ministry is also a part of the Government. The reason why .I referred the hon. Member to the D.D.C.s is that if he had a complaint about a certain area, the district information officer attends the D.D.C. meetings, and he could then ask him to send a film show there. I said that there is only one van in every province and, therefore, it is not easy to show these films regularly in all the areas. But if a certain Member of Parliament has a complaint about his arearaise a question but not to make a speech.newspeechnewspeechMR. MATHENGE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, would the Assistant Minister "be specific and tell us if these  films were advertised to inform the people that they would be shown on a particular date at a particular place. We were not aware when these films were being brought and they re are very important.newspeechnewspeechMR. KHASAKHALA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, every district has got a district information officer who sends a circular through the chiefs and assistant chiefs to inform them when a certain film would be shown at a certain area, whether at a market centre, a divisional  headquarter or a school playground. This circular to the district officers, the chiefs and the assistant chiefs, If those officers do not inform their people, then it is unfortunate. However,ocircular is always sent out by the district information officers giving the dates and details.newspeechnewspeechMR. KHASAKEALA (CTD.): the only way he can. raise his complaint is through the D.D.C. whose meetings the district information officer attends. The district information officer will make a note of it and make sure that a film show is scheduled for this particular area in complaint.newspeechnewspeechMR. MUTHURA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can see that the Assistant Minister is making a way. He has said that a circular is always sent to chiefs and assistant  chiefs informing the public about the films. Can the Assistant Minister now promise to this House that tomorrow or next week he will lay on the Table a copy of the circular which was sent to the chiefs in Laikipia District.newspeechnewspeechAn HON. MEMBER: That is correct.newspeech	newspeechMR. KHASAKHALA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will do that. Question No.317 newspeechnewspeech MR. SHIKUKU asked the Attorney-General: -(a)	whether he is aware that Mr. Mwaura Njihia. was imprisoned for a total of 36 years with strokes and having Served 15 12 years and also having received SO strokes of the  cane, was acquitted on appeal; and(b)	should the answer to (a) be in the affirmative, what steps does the Attorney-General intend to take to ensure that  this nwananchi and other innocent wananchi are compensated.On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. This Question was asked sometime in the middle of last year, and. to my surprise I have not been given a written reply from the Attorney-GeneralsChambers. This is very unfair. It was asked in 1986.newspeechnewspeechTHE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I apologise for that. However, if the hon. Member checks in his  pigeon hole, I am sure he  will get a copy of the written reply.newspeechnewspeechMR. MWACHOFI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Isthe Attorney-General in order to mislead the House by telling hon. Shikuku that he can get a copy of the written answer in the pigeon hole? This i3 not the practice. Answers are never sent to the pigeon holes.newspeech(applause)newspeechAN HON. MEMBER: He has never been a Back-Bencher.newspeechnewspeechTHE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli): Mr. Speaker, Sir, all that I said was that if the hon. Member would check in his  pigeon holehe might  get it there, because I checked.newspeechnewspeechMR. SHlKUkU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is theAttorney-General in order to mislead this House? Replies to Questionsare always given to the Clerk of National Assembly and  he does notgive it to the Questioner or the Back-bencher until three minutes tothe Question Time. I have checked with the Clerk and he does not haveit, and it is never sent to the pigeon holes. So, is he in order tomislead the House? We are never given the replies in advance. Theyaxe always given here in the House but not in the pigeon holes. newspeechnewspeechTHE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli):	 Mr. Speaker, Sir, I did check with my office this morning and I was informed that a copy of my reply has already beensent. I  will check where it landed if the hon. Member did not  getit. Having said that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.According to the records, Mr. Mwaura Njihia has had several criminal cases of robbery with violence, contrary to Section 2962 of the Penal Procedure Code. For instance, in 1971 he had two cases in Nakuru and one in Thika, and in 1981 he had one case in Nairobi. The two Nakuru cases had their appeals lodged in 1971 but they were rejected, and then notices of appeal were again lodged in 1985 and 1986. The judgements were  delivered, in 1986 and 1987.newspeechnewspeechTHE ATTORNEY GENERAL (Mr. Muli)(ctd. ):Apparently, the Thika and Nairobi eases had no appeals lodged.Mr. Speaker, Sir, appeals for Nakuru cases were only allowed after the appellant had requested for the same out of time and after a long delay and as such there was nothing to stop the prison authoriti to carry out their duties in respect of the imprisonment accorded to this culprit.newspeechnewspeechTHE ATTORNEY-GExERAL (Mr. Kuli) Ctd:Mr. Speaker, Sir, this question of compensation where a person has been allowed to leave prison, has been before this House too often. We have no provisions in our law which al1ow anyone who has succeeded in an appeal to be paid compensation.newspeechnewspeechMR. SHIKUKU: Arising from that unsatisfactory reply, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Attorney-General has intentionally avoided the crux of the matter that this mwananchi was acquitted as innocent. This mwananchi was acquitted after successfully appealing against the crimes he was said to have committed. Will the Attorney-General tell us why it took so long to acquit this man - as he has said - and why he was carded 8 strokes while he, the Attorney-General, has never had even one stroke of the cane? What does he say to that effect?newspeechnewspeechMR. MULI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, getting a stroke of the cane is not a sort of privilege. I managed to get a stroke of the cane at school if the hon. Member has not had one.Mr. Speaker, Sir, this convict, had, as I have said, several criminal offences and convictions newspeechnewspeechMR. SHIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is the Attorn General in order to call this mwananchi a criminal after he has been acquitted?newspeechnewspeechMR. MULI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not agree with the hon. Memberthat Mr. Mwaura was acquitted. Let us not play about with the word "acquit".He was not acquitted. His appeal may have been allowed on technicalities and his jail term may have been reduced. As I have said, Sir, We. Mwaura had convictions of at least four robbery cases. The first one which was committed in 1971, he was convicted and sentenced to a jail term of 14 years. In another one, he was convicted and sentenced to jail for 16 years and later he was convicted for six years, Out of the four convictions, only two were allowed and there was no appeal for the others at all. Therefore, the 15 years he had served were in respect of the other cases where there were-no-appeals. As a matter of fact, he must have been given a bonus by way of reprieve.newspeechnewspeechMR. SIFUNA: Mr. Speaker, Sir. will the Attorney-General bring a Bill to this House to the effect that any mwananchi who has been oonvicted and, maybe, served for a certain period in jail should be compensated? In this particular ease, this mwananchi got 8 strokes of the cane, Now; can the Attorney-General order that the magistrate or the judge who sentenced this man should also receive 8 strokes of the cane to settle the bitterness in this case?newspeechnewspeechMR. MUULI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, cur laws do not permit for compensationas I said before, With regard to the magistrate who convicted Mr. Mwaura,he exercised his judicial powers and, as such, I am afraid, nothing can be done.newspeechnewspeechMR. NYAGA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the Attorney-General whether it would be in order for all judges and Members of this House to spend, at least, a weekend in our civil jails to see how it looks like for a man to receive 8 strokes of the cane and to spend 15 12 years in jail?newspeechnewspeechAll.HON. .MEMBER: Including the Speaker.newspeechnewspeechMR. MULI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I cannot apprehend any question here.The hon. Member is just making a comment and if he would like to spend aweekend in a civil jail, he can" contravene any of the laws and will findhimself there. People are not just sent to a civil jail; it is not a hotel. They go there because of a conviction.newspeechnewspeechMR. LUKINDO: Mr. Speaker, Sir. if I heard what the AttorneyGeneral said correctly, he has informed this House that we have no provisionsin the laws of this country to compensate: acquitted persons. Now, could he,as the Attorney-General of this country, bring a Bill in this House for approval?This is because the wananchi should net be humiliated in such a way in a free country.newspeechnewspeechMR. MULI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the answer here is that it is contrary to public policy to legislate for compensation of a person who had been convicted.newspeechnewspeechMRS. ASIYO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I am very disturbed about the attitude of the Attorney-General with regard to previous convictions of offenders. He has enumerated several instances where Mr. Mwaura was jailed for whatever offences. Is he telling us that Mr. Mwaura was not capable of rehabilitation and reform?newspeechnewspeechMR. MULI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, robbery with, violence carries mandatory death sentence. Mr. Mwaura was convicted of robbery with violence and was imprisoned for a number of years. No doubt, in the prison, he must have rehabilitated and that is why, perhaps, a reprieve was given, instead of serving the entire period. newspeechnewspeechMR. SHIKUKU: Arising from the avoidance by the Attorney-General to reply to a genuine question, Sir, and taking into account this is a National Assembly and looking at the hon. Members here who are quite disturbed, could he consider bringing a Bill to this House to recommend for compensation? Which public is he talking about? We are the spokesmen of the public. The question is: Will he bring a Bill to this House?newspeechnewspeechMR. MULI: Kr. Speaker, Sir, laws do not remain static and I agreethat consideration can be given from time to time. When time is opportune,such a Bill can be considered.newspeechnewspeechHON. MEMBERS: When?newspeechnewspeechMR. SPEAKER: Next Question.newspeech	Question No. .newspeechMR. SIFUNA asked the Attorney-General:(a)	whether he is aware that the rightful owner of Ndalu Settlement Sc_heme Ho. 9 Plot No. 162 is Mr. Cherikona Welernusaya as per allotment letter dated 29.1.1965;(b)	why the Court of Appeal" at Kisumu under civil appeal No. 7 of 1986 between Henry Cihilikona-the Respondent in Civil Case No. 57 of 198 transÂ¬ferred the said land to Law of Succession Act (Cap.l6) when Mr. Henry Chilikona Welernusaya Wakhungu is still alive; and(c)	whether he could make sure that Mr. Welernusaya is not denied his rightful land. newspeech(d)	Welernusaya as per allotment letter dated 29.1.1965; newspeechnewspeechTHE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli): Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I reply,the Question by the hon. Member for Bungoma South has got a catch. It has a catch because several names of different are used. I would like to say that writing and answer and reading it may be incomprehensive. The position her is that there was a nan called "A" who was allotted a piece of land and he subsequently died in 196. He had a son  who in turn had a son called "C" "C" assumes the name of the deceased grandfather. He goes with these names to the land registrar and says: "I am A ". Obviously, there is a catch here because the names are similar.newspeechnewspeechTHE ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Mr. Muli ) (contd.):However, the case goes to court, and the Court of Appeal finds that as a matter of fact, A cannot be C,becauce of the" simplereason that they are different people.the Court of Appeal, therefore, orders the land to go under succession. With that illustration, Mr". Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(a) I am aware that Plot No.162 in Ndalu Settlement Scheme No.9 was allocated to a Mr. Cherikona Welenrasaya, as per allotment letter dated 2th December, 1985.(b) There was a case which ended in the Court of Appeal at Kisumu, and the court decided and transferred the case to to under the Law of Succession. This was because the rightful owner - the said Mr, Cherikona Welemiisaya - was no longer alive, as he had died in 198. Another person called Mr. ChilikonaWelemusaye Wakhurgu,who is still aliyeand is now claiming the land, is not the same person as the original Cherikona Welemusaya. (c)	Therefore, he cannot have the land because it must under the succession of his grandfather.newspeechnewspeechMR. SIFUNA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the answer given by the hon. Attorney-General is not correct. The land which the Attorney-General is talking about is not the same piece of land we are talking about. when his grandfather, died, and was buried in his own land. This particular piece of land, which is No.9 Plot No.162 belongs to Henry Chilikona Welenrusaya, according to the documents given to him. There were some problems between him and his brothers, and instead of the court awarding this land to Mr. Henry Chilikona VYelemusaya, they "decided with other people, to put this land under the Succession Act. That is why I brought this Question before the House, so that this gentleman is not be denied his rightful "Land. Could the newspeechnewspeechMR. SIFUNA (contd.):	Attorney-General, therefore, make sure that Mr. Henry Chilikona Weiemusaya is not denied his rightful dues. If the Attorney-General  wants, I can "bring this gentleman to his office to verify all the documents to prove that he is the rightful owner of this law newspeechnewspeechMR. MULI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a point of principle here. The principle is this; That the highest court in this	country, which is the Court of Appeal, has decided, that this	case crust be decided by the Law of Succession. It is not like	in the colonial days when we used to go to the Privy Council in	England to challenge the decisions of the Court of Appeal.	Unfortunately, this House does not have a committee like, thePrivy Council where that decision can be challenged. So theprinciple here is that it would be perhaps wrong for this	HOUSE to start sitting as a court of appeal over the Court of	Appeal, which is constituted. The other point is that when thisland was allotted, Henry Chilikona Welemusaya Waking was a small "boy,and he could not have been  allotted this land. The policy atthat time was only to allot land to adult landless, but not minors.newspeechnewspeechMR. SIFUNA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I fail to understand whythe Attorney-General is trying to mislead this House. My	Question to him was Where Mr. Henry Chilikona Welemusaya is the	rightful owner of this piece of land. This gentleman could not have taken all the trouble to go up to the country of appeal if the piece of landwas not his. This boys mother "bought this land in his name,and the land was given to Henry Chilikona Welemusaya when hewas still very young. His grandfather who died has got adifferent piece of land. He was never "buried in that particular piece of land that I am referring to. I am talkingabout Plot No. 162. It does not "belong to the grandfather,	it "belongs to this particular "boy. That is why I am appealingto the Attorney-General to make sure that justice should	fee-denied this particular boy. Could he do that?newspeechnewspeech (Mr. Muli): Perhaps, Mr. Speaker, you may like to guide  us here.  This is a decision of the Court of Appeal and ray hands are tied. I cannot constitute my_self as the Court of Appeal over the Court of Appeal that is existing.newspeechnewspeechMR. SPEAKER: let us now go back to Mr. Kilikus Question. Question No. 595 newspeechnewspeechMR. KILIKU asked the Minister for Local Government:-(a)	what is delaying the opening of Chaani Market which has been built through the World Bank Project of Site and Service Scheme, and(b)	whether the Minister will take 	necessary action to have this market 	opened.newspeechnewspeechTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. Marata):Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to apologize for not being here when theQuestion was asked for the first time.I beg to reply.(b)	Chaani Market which was first opened in August, 1985, was closed in September, 1986 by the Medical Officer of Health due to lack of water and other sanitary facilities.(b)	The said facilities have been provided and the market has been re-opened.newspeechnewspeechMR.

Will the Minister order the employer to reinstate  him unconditionally?newspeechnewspeechTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. arap Metto):Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(a) I am aware that Sir. Peter Otieno was dismissed byhis employer MS Cargo Containers Limited, Mombasa, on. 7th  October, 1987 Mr. Otieno was dismissed because, as a fork liftdriver, he negligently caused an accident which destroyed a fork lift worth KSh.1.3 million. Nevertheless, on dismissal, he was paid a sum of KSh.3,45755 made up as follows (i) 7 days wages	- Ksh. 259.7	(ii) 24 days leave   - Ksh.    98.9 (iii) Provident Fund - Ksh.2,288.95Total -	Ksh.3,457.55(b) I am unable to order the unconditional reinstatement of Mir. Otieno because such an order is not in accordance with the laid down procedure under the law. If Mr. Otieno feels that he was unjustifiably dismissed, the correct procedure for him to follow is to report the matter to his union which may ultimately take up the case with the Industrial Court for adjudication and determination.-newspeechnewspeechMR. KTLTKU; Mr. Speaker Sir Mr. Otieno was involved in an accident when he was on official duty, driving a fork lift, when he came back from hospital, he found that his employer had  dismissed him. However, I want to know whether the Minister can produce a traffic police investigation report because hesaid tha.t Mr. Otieno fe was dismissed because he had negligentlycaused an accident Can he prove that this accident was caused by negligence? I cannot believe that the employer was in order to dismiss Mr. Otieno on the spot.newspeechnewspeechMR. arap METTO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to the B reply I have given the hon.

In my reply, I said that there is a procedure to be follow.newspeechnewspeechMR. arap METTO (ctd.): by a person who feels that he has been unjustifiably dismissed.The correct procedure is for him to take up the matter with hisunion so that i it may be heard by the Industrial Court. That isthe time when the union will act on his case. After that, ifthere is anything which has h not been decided upon properly,  we can look into it.newspeechnewspeechMR. KHALIE: Mr. Speaker. Sir, the reason given for having this worker summarily dismissed was that he had negligently caused an accident. That information was to be given by the employ because if it were not given by the employer, then the Ministry of Labour, or the police, should have investigated the matter end found out how the accident was caused. Mr. Otieno was summarily dismissed on the grounds that the had caused an accidentnegligently and the information was given by the employer.

SPEAKER: Mr. Kisiani, can you explain?newspeechnewspeechMR. MISIANI: Sir, there is a good reason. There was a reply thatI believe, was passed on to the hon. Member last week and there was a period of time when I was unwell so when this reply was drafted, we had not looked at it. This is because soon after the Minister himself also fell ill and since we resumed, we found that this reply was not satisfactory and that is why we would like to give a proper reply to the Houses.newspeechnewspeechHON. MEMBERS: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.newspeechnewspeechMR. SPEAKER: Order! There is no point in dealing with this matter now since the  Assistant Minister has said that he has to more or less prepare a proper reply, So, there is no point of dealing with it now and then looking forward to doing it again.

SPEAKER: Not on that matter. I have already ruled on it and it is finished. newspeechnewspeechMR. ABIWY-ABUYA: Mr, Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Education the following Question by Private Notice.(d)	Why was Riomoro Primary School closed down by the local administration in March. 1987?(e)	Is the Minister aware that the order given by the local D.E.B. and D.D.C. on 25th May, 1987 and 28th September. 1987 respectively to have the school reopened was not followed?newspeechnewspeechTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. MMaitsi): Mr. Speaker. Sir I beg to reply.(a) Riomoro Primary School which was duly recommended by the KisiiDistrict Education Beard to start in 1987 with one class of Standard I was closed down by the local administration and consequently the two teachers who were deployed there together with about 9 pupils were transferred to the neighbouringNyachiche Primary School. This was because of security reasons and also because some community members preferred the cite of the school to become a market, place.newspeechnewspeechMR. KIKUYU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. In the Assistant Minister reply, he has touched on a very important point of "security reason". What security grounds are there in Kisii District to make a school be closed? Is Kisii District under a state of emergency?newspeechnewspeechTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. MMaitsi): Mr. Speak Sir, I wish the lion. Member would have waited until the reply is complete before he jumped on the point of order.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am aware that on 25th May, 1987, and on 28th September, 1987, Kisii District Education Board and the Kisii District Development Committee (D.D.C.) respectively advised that Riomoro Primary School should be re-opened on condition that the school community should decide unanimously to either establish a school or a market at this site.Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we know, Riomoro Primary School started as a nursery school, and children used to go there. By way of reducing children there, they started a new primary school in 1987. The Board made this recommendation during its meeting which was held, as stipulated, on 8th September, 1987. Consequently, the school was opened with a Standard I class in January, 1987, and the Ministry or the District Education Officer posted the teachers there with about 9 children. In March, 1987, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Headmaster of this newly established school wrote to the District Commissioner, Kisii, with a copy of his letter to the District Education Officer, Kisii, explainÂ¬ing of a frequent harassment from the school community this to say that those who were interested in a market other than the school went against the idea and threatened the Headmaster and his staff. Some members of the school community wanted the school site to be developed into a market place. The school acreage is approximately about three-quarters of an acre which relatively might not make up.newspeechnewspeechTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Mr. MMaitsi)(Contd.): for a school. Therefore, on receiving this complaint, the District Commissioner, the District Education Officer, the Chairman of the Gusii County Council, and some councillors, together with hon. Abuya- Abuya. Member of Parliament for the area, visited the school, and advised the school community to resolve their differences.Nov, because of the gravity of the insecurity prevailing at that time at the school, the District Education Officer for the area transferred all the pupils and the two teachers to the next nearestschool which is known as "Nyachichi" and which is situated abouttwo-and a half kilometres away from Riomoro Primary School. Thechildren are now learning at this school uninterrupted.In May, 1987, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Kisii District Education Boardrecommended that Riomoro Primary School should be re-opened. Hon.Abuya-Abuya, M.P., attended the Board Meeting. Now, on hearings of the District Education Board (D.E.B.) recommendation, once more, the opposing group called on District Education Officer, and advised him of the eminent danger of re-opening this school. The District Commissioner told the local people at Riomoro that unless they sought out their differences the school would remain closed down. We would only be interested if we hear that these people have agreed because there are opposing factors. The moment they agree that the school should be re-opened without any opposition and fighting over it, we will well come in. But if there is still continuing this kind of faction, we have no alternative other than to leave it until they decide on the matter.newspeechnewspeechMR. ABUYA-ABUYA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, from the outset, let me say that the answer by the Assistant Minister contains total "lies"! The Assistant Minister says that the school .newspeechnewspeechTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR COMMERCE (Mr. Lalampna): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Did you hear the hon. Member use the word "lies"? Is it a Parliamentary language?newspeechnewspeechMR. SPEAKER; No - we do not. use that kind of language here, Mr. Abuya-Abuyn. So, withdraw and apologise to the House.newspeechnewspeechMR. ABUYA-ABUYA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I withdraw and apologise, but he is "misleading" the House. newspeechnewspeechMR. SPEAKER: You cannot say that and then say "but"! newspeechnewspeechMR. ABUYA-ABUYA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I withdraw the word "lies", but he is "misleading" the House.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister has told this House that the community was harassing the teachers. This is not true. The report contained in "Kenya Leo" Jumapili, 25th May, 1987, which reads: "Shule Yafungwa Wilayani Kisii". This is the story and it is true, and I quote:-"Wanafunzi zaidi ya 2 wa shule ya msingi ya Riomoro katika lokesheni ya. Central Kitutu Wilayani Kisii wamekosa masomo yao kwa muda wa miezi miwili iliyopita baada ya shule hiyo kufungwa na ofisa wa elimu wa tarafa ya Manga, Bw. J.Omoyo, pamoja na chifu mdogo wa eneo hilo, Bw. Saitison Nyangau, walioadar.iana polisi wanne wa utawala waliokuwa na bastola."Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is the truth. The community has always wanted a school. It is the community that donated the plot which is two and a half acres,and considering the scarcity of land in Kisii, that is good enough. Delegation by delegation has gone to the District Education Officer, the District Commissioner, and the Provincial Education Officer. They are alwaj-s chased away from the Government office. I,personally, as a Member of Parliament for the area, have talked to the Minister himself about the issue. I have also talked to the Director of Education, but I have not been listened to.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the District Education Board, meeting of 8th September, 1987, approved the school. The Assistant Minister .newspeechnewspeechMR. ABUYA-ABUYA (Contd.):has misled the House by saying that a condition was made for theschool to re-open. If I can read the minutes - Minute 6286 of25th May, 1989 -states, and I quote:- This is Minute 6286 (iii)."The D.O., the D.C. Gusii County Council, and the area M.P. arranged to meet the school committee, and officially announce the opening of the school".The harassment, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has come from the assistant chief,the D.O. chief, and the councillor because they want this plot tobe turned into a market, place so that they can grab the plots.Could the Assistant Minister direct that this school be re-openedimmediately? This is pathetic. I can show you the picture of thechildren who are out of school and in the rain. The newspapers says:-"When it rains on them, the cold weather on the Kisii highlands harasses them each morning, and yet they are never attended to. Their school, Riomoro Primary School, was closed down by the local adminiÂ¬stration to give way for a market. The 2 children .newspeechnewspeechMR. SPEAKER: Order, Mr. Abuya-Abuya! What is there in thenewspaper does not mean that it is correct!newspeechnewspeechMR. ABUYA-ABUYA: Mr, Speaker, Sir, I am saying this becauseit should touch anybody who is a human being, and anybody who lovesNyayo children. Would the Assistant Minister order that the schoolbe re-opened immediately?newspeechnewspeechMR. Mr. MAITSI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is good, that the hon.Member is taking that interest. But on the other hand, I would say for what reason would an assistant chief and the Administration Police carry guns, to a place where there is peace? It is also misleading for the hon. Member to say that when we start a school, we shall be having 2 children in Standard I. This is completely unusual. He should have said that perhaps if two classes had been started, it would, be understood. But the only way have it back is through peace. We want peace in the area.newspeechnewspeechMR. CHEPKOK: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. It is written in the newspaper that the school had 2 children. The information officer who was there co-anted the children and found that they were 2. why is the Assistant Minister misleading the House "by denying that the children were 2?newspeechnewspeechMR. MIMAITSI: Mr. Speaker. Sir, we administer schools through the district education officer and the assistant education officer. We do not administer them through the newspapers. we are, therefore, following what our administration has written and told us the position is they told us that the position is not the way the hon. Member is alleging.newspeechnewspeechMR. ABUTYA-ABUTYA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.newspeechnewspeechMR. SPEAKER: Orderl We axe seeing people "becoming disorderly. We should "behave like mature people.newspeechnewspeechMR. SHIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. My point of order is in connection -with the reply given to this House, which has "been refuted by the hon. Member. Now, will the Assistant Minister substantiate that the hon. Member and all those people whom he says went there did actually do that? From this newspaper report, only the chief and district officer are mentioned; there is no mention of the Member of Parliament. In other words, the Assistant Ministers reply is not true. So, could he substantiate that the hon. Member was there? The newspapers do not say that the hon. Member was there.newspeechnewspeechMR. MMAITSI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I cannot substantiate what is in a newspaper. I have said that the hon. Member, the Chairman, of Gusii County Council, the chief and the district officer visited the place. If they visisted it, then they have reasons why they do not want to go a head and start the school there, they do not want to start it in this place. newspeech	newspeechMR. ABUYA-ABUYA; On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir point of order is that the Assistant Minister is misleading the House. This is because after the meeting of 25.5.87, it was decided that since the school had been closed done using askaris, and, therefore, scaring the community. The district commissioner, the Chairman, Gusii County Council - and that is the information. I quoted from the minutes of meeting should go to the site for purpose of opening the school the peoples confidence in the school. It is true that there .newspeechnewspeechMR. ABUYA-ABUYA (CTD):are 2 children in that school; 1 of them "being in the nursery school class andthe other 1 being in the standard one class.newspeechnewspeechMR. MMAITSI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am sure that the hon. Member lives in that area. However, it is clear that what he has done here is just bringing in reports contained in the newspapers. I am sure that the district education officer and the district commissioner aire well informed about this matter. The district conoissioner is the chairman of both the district education board (D.E.B.) and the district development committee (D.D.C.). Therefore, after discussing the matter in those committees, he went to the site himself. Now, since he was not satisfied that the site was very safe, he wrote to us.newspeechnewspeechMR.

SHIKUKU: Arising from that reply, Mr. Speaker, Sir,would the Attorney-General, apart from using his files use his other means to find out whether, indeed, this company is in existence and whether these addresses are still the same.

KHALIF: Ho, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is different. MR. SPEAKER: Okay, Mr. Khalif.newspeechnewspeechMR. KHALIF: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker? Sir. I stand up to raise a matter of considerable significance to me as the Member of Parliament for Wajir West and as the Secretary-General of the Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims, and indeed, to the entire Muslim community in Kenya. This is in connection with some remarks uttered by hon. Shikuku, the Member for Butere, in Parliament some time back to the effect that mosques which, as you are aware, are exclusively used for the worship of the Almighty God by Muslims have been used as meeting places where people hatch Tip political tricks and machinations against other people. The hon. Member was specifically referring to some problem pertaining to a Councillor Maitha of Mombasa during a Question and an answer discussing the councillors problems. Mr. Shikuku talked of "Shariffs law made in a mosque".Mr. Speaker, Sir, these remarks are of great import, not to mention their insinuation, what hon. Shikuku was imputing is that mosques are used for plotting and scheming evil. They were, therefore, made in bad taste and have hurt the feelings of the Muslim community in Kenya who have naturally taken great exception to the remarks.	The purpose of this point of order is to ask hon. Shikuku through you to withdraw these remarks and apologise to the House, failing which it will be in keeping with the dignity of this august House and the natural justice that he substantiates the serious allegations contained in his very derogatory remarks.There might be differences in matters of principle or political persuasion between hon. Shikuku and hon. Shariff Nassir. Those differences are theirs as two individuals and they have right to frustrate the House as they deem proper. I hope that neither the Muslim community nor the Christian community has anything to do with those differences of theirs.Thank you.newspeechnewspeechMR. SHIKUKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir. what the hon. Member is saying gives the impression that I stood up in this House and uttered the words he has mentioned. He was not in the House then, to start with. I do not know from where he got this information. I was seated here, and somebody was, I think, making an interjection which the Press picked up. I was never on my feet saying what he is saying. Therefore, I do not have that ill-feeling against Muslims, as such. I just interjected when I was seated here; I was a not on my feet.Probably, I had batter enlighten the Muslims in this country that I was not on my feet saying that. I was just seated here, and I merely interjected, but this did not convey what the hon. Member has told the House to the effect that I am looking at the Muslim faith as such. I did not have that intention at all. I only said that this must have happened somewhere. Things can be discussed in a mosque just as they can in a Catholic cathedral. What is wrong with that? I did not have the intention that he is conveying to this House to the effect that I was looking down upon Muslims. You can discuss things in a Catholic cathedral or in the Church of the Province of Kenya, and there is nothing wrong with discussing things in the House of God. newspeechnewspeechMR.

JALDESA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. My point of order is in connection with the security situation in Isiolo district. I have two points of order which relate to security matters and they are both directed to the Office of the President.As you may be aware, there have been many killings and cattle rustling in Isiolo District. What we have discovered is that many cattle rustlers kill people and steal cattle and escape easily. I want the Minister of State, in charge of internal security  in this country to make a clear statement explaining how many people were murdered in Isiolo, for example since January, 1987; what action was taken and what action they are intending to take to prevent the recurrence of similar insidences in the district.My second point is that we as the leaders, are very much concerned about this situation and we try to convene meetings of leaders of Garissa and Isiolo districts. We have managed to meet elders and we tried to reconcile the differences that exist among the tribes of that area. But it is very unfortunate that when we planned for a meeting on 16th October, 1987, the meeting failed. Members of Parliament from Isiolo District and Kanu officials made arrangements to tour the district calling for peace and calling on the people to live as brothers. But some people somewhere are out to defeat our purpose. It is clearly shown by the fact that on 16th of this month, when we planned to hold a meeting at Wodogashe, the Clerk Isiolo County Council objected and sent a delegation of five councillors to protest against our aims. On 16th of this same month, he took the council vehicle and went to Kulamawe and spent the whole day preaching many bad things to the community encouraging them to fight. On 17th October, 1987, while not on official duty took the council vehicle and went to a place called Gatatse in Modogashe where he held an illegal night meeting and told the people not to agree to our purpose. On 18th of this month, he then went to Galbatula and conducted a similar exercise. This was tantamount to encouraging a tribal war and we have reported several times and no action has been taken. On 2th October, 1937, during the Kenyatta Day celebrations, the speeches that were made by leaders, particularly the one made by the Chairman of Isiolo County Council are speeches which are likely to cause public disturbances and make people fight. It seems that those of us who are after peace and unity in this district are getting a lot of problems.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the same people are trying to defeat our aim by using the animals which are stolen. With these few remarks, I urge the Minister of State, Office of the President, who is in charge of internal security to explain the situation to us and tell us who is causing these problems. This could be the work of a dissident.Also there are many people who have lost their animals and also their lives. We want the Minister, when he comes to reply to this point of order, to tell us what immediate plans he has for assisting the victims.Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir.newspeechnewspeechMR. MUHYAO: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. In short fact I have two, short points of order; the first one is directed to the Chair and the second one is directed to the Office of the President. I will begin with second one.During Kenyatta Day celebrations on 2th October, 1987, the Machakos District Commissioner addressed wananchi in Machakos. While delivering his speech the District Commissioner said that oath taking is rampant in Machakos District. He went as fax as uttering the following words:"I am tired of oath taking in Mbooni, Kilungu and Yatta Division."These remarks were published in the local newspapers and they been read by many people and many people are worried.  This has led people into thinking that there is oath taking in Machakos District and that people in Machakos are breaking the law. Knowing what politics is, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this matter can be used in campaigns during the next general elections. So, I would like the Minister concerned in the Office of the President to make investigations and make a Ministerial Statement in this House so that he may clear christians in Mbooni. I have done my own investigations and I have not comeacross any oath taking in Mbooni. These are serious allegations and I would like the Minister concerned to make a Ministerial Statement to clear the air.The other point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is addressed to the Chair. Last year and this year also the Chair severally warned some people against the practice of taking out issues discussed in this House to go and discuss them in other fora. For instance there was a debate in this House last year about the Ministry of Local Government. You will find that the same debate was carried out of this House and the same matter was discussed by some councillors in Kirinyaga District. The story was published in The Standard and it was based on a speech given by hon. Njuno in this House. The same issue which ho no Shikuku talked about in this House was also discussed by councillors in Mombasa. When you look at these matters you will find that it appears as if there are some people who are âbreathing" through these councilors. For how long has the Chair got to warn that this is a dangerous trend and that issues discussed in this House cannot be discussed in any other forum? When will leaders stop "breathing" through other people? Those are my only two points, Mr. Speaker, Sir.newspeechAN HON. MEMBER: Can the Chair respond? newspeechnewspeechMR. SPEAKER: yes. I have said what hon. Munyao hassaid and of course I want to know more. I would like hon. Munyaoto make it more clearer. But that can be done without takingany time of this House.newspeechnewspeechMR. MUHYAO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will give the Chair more information. When hon. Njuno was contributing to that debate here he talked about what was happening in Kirinyaga,Also Mr. Keriri talked about it.The matter was covered in The Daily Nation issue of Saturday the same week. Also what hon. Shikuku said here was discussed by the Mombasa Kanu Branch and it was reported in The Sunday Standard.So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, you can look at the copies of the two newspapers.newspeechnewspeechMR. CHEPKOE: Jambo la nidhamu, Bw. Spika. Nidhamu yangu ni kuhusu mtu wangu mmoja arnbaye alipigwa na District Officer wa fgfes Eapcherop Division. Nilikuwa nikifikiri kuwa wakolon eh waliihama nchi hii lakird kumbe kuna "wakoloni " wengine ambao walimaliza masomo yao iiivi majuzi na ambao wameajiriwa na Serikali kama wakuu wa tarafa! Bw. Spika, mtu huyo alifungwa kwenye shina la  mti na kucharazwa vlboko mpaka akazirai kabisa. Alipozirai aliwekwa korokoroni na siku ya Jumatatu iliyofuata alipelekwa kortini akiwa amefura mkonos Alipelekwa kortini ili akafanyiwe mashtakaoBw. Spika, hiyo haikuwa mara ya kwanza kwa huyo Mkuu wa Tarafa kupiga mtu. Hii ilikuwa mara ya me kwa Mkuu huyo wa Tarafa lampxgazasfeH kuwapiga watu.newspeechnewspeechAN HON.

Spika, waziri anayehusika anamialiamu Mkuu wa Tarafa ya Kapcherop.Bw. Spika, mara ya kwanza Mkuu huyu wa Tarafa aliwalta watu kwenye ofisi yake Kuna watu kutoka makabila 17 ambao wanaishi katika sehemu liiyo. Watu wengi walifika kKHTiiH kwenye ofisi ya Mkuu huyo wa Tarafa lakini yeye hakuwa na lolote la kuwaambia isipokuwa kumwuliza kila mtu aseme alikotoka. Lakini Mkuu wa Tarafa ali pat a majibu ka hili lifuatalo hapa: "Mimi nimezaliwa hapa lakini niliambiwa kwamba wasazi wangu walihamia sehemu  kutoka Murang zamani sana.â "Hata mimi nimeambiwa kwamba wazazi wangu walitoka Nyanza." Watu waliotoa majibu ya aina hiyo waliamriwa kulala chini na kuchapwa viboko. It is terrible.Nara, ya pili D.. huyo aliwaita wanawake ksS katika ofisi yake na kuwachapa viboko. Hii ni mifano mitatu ambayo nimetoa hapa Hivi majuzi wakati wa  kujiandikishaaliwakataza watu.newspeechnewspeechMR. SPEAKER: Order, This really is the wrong way of doing these things You cannot make accusations like this You cannot just come here and make a speech here tinder the guise of a point of order and then you go out feeling protected? I think you should follow the normal way If anything has happened you should Table a Question here or move a Motion or some tiling like that but not through this kind of talk. All that itbenefits is It is a sort of protection while you are speaking  from there I do not think we should be doing this kind of thing. We should be candid and produce what we are saying.newspeechnewspeechMR. CHEPKOK: Bw. Spika, ninayasema maneno haya kwasababu ya uchungu ambao ninao. Nimewafahaioisha maofisa wa	utawala juu ya jambo hili lakini hawafanyi lo lote. Kwa hivyo ningemtaka Waziri anayehusilca afanye uchunguzi na kutoa taarifa katika Bunge hili na katueleza iwapo wakuu wa tarafa wameruhusiwa kuwapiga watu. newspeechnewspeechMR. SPEAKER: Order! Order! If you have already said what you had in your mind before the House, I do not think it is necessary now to follow it with a long speech on which issues What you should do is that you should show the evidence of what you are alleging. This is because you are alleging very serious things. That is why I say the way you are approaching it is not proper. When you speak here you are protected; it might be different outside. I think we had better move on now.newspeechnewspeechMR. ABUYA-ABUYA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.newspeechnewspeech MR. CHEPKOK: Bw. Spika, nimeyasema maneno haya kwa sababu mimi pamoja na Mkuu wa Wilaya tulimwendea huyo Mkuu wa Tarafa na kumwambia asiwapige watu tena. I am talking the truth. That is what I saw. We went to him with the District Commissioner but he could not listen to us. That is why I am requesting the Office of the President to carry out investigations and then issue a Ministerial Statement here explaining to the House whether there is a law.newspeech	newspeechMR. SPEAKER: We have heard now; I think we should move on now.newspeechnewspeechMR. ABUYA-ABUYA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I requested, the Ministry of Transport and Communications to issuo a statement in connection with a contractor who is constructing the Kisii Chemosit Road. The allegations are that this contractor is removing the machinery bought by the Government costing million of shillings and taking them away. I was asking the Minister to issue a statement to ensure that these machines are not removed, from the site before the whole matter is discussed as it might result in the Government losing a lot of money. There are people in the Ministry who are bent on giving this contractor these machines which have been purchased by the Government. I was asking for a clear statement from the Minister as to what steps his Ministry is taking to safeguard the interests of the Government. I asked this last week and so far there has been e no forthcoming statement from the Minister Could I ask the Minister to respond to this? newspeechnewspeechMR. SPEAKER; Next Order.newspeechnewspeechMR. ABUYA-ABUYA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.Last week when I asked this the Assistant Minister was just sitting here and did not respond and today too he is just sitting here. He should respond to my point of order.newspeechnewspeechTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. arap Koech): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not think the hon. Member wouldwant me to just give the statement straight away. I have notedthe allegations and we are going to find out what is happening.

MUNYAO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was speaking last week before the House adjourned and, I thought that I would finish first before the Question is proposed. I thought that is the procedure..newspeechnewspeechAN HON. MEMBER: You had only about five minutes regaining newspeechnewspeechMR. HUNYAO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, in fact I have more than five minutes.newspeechnewspeechMR. SPEAKER: You can use the five minutes to finish your contribution said then I will propose the question.newspeechnewspeechM. MUNYAO: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to continue although in actual fact I had more than five minutes. Before the House adjourned last week, I had brought up the  issue when I was supporting this second Mzima water pipelino that water in this country is becoming very expensive and that the Ministry ought to do something to reduce the tariffs on waters. At that time U. C. I cited as an example, Katangi Water Project in Kalawa location which is the only project in the area and women there are asked to pay as much as shs. 5-for a drum of water and shs. 1- for a calabash which cannot hold 2 litres of water. I am sure that the Minister took  5 this into account as I wanted him to tell us what is happening there. I was appealing to the Ministry of Water Development to at least look into this problem more sympathetically because these people have no other source of water. I just wanted the Minister to see whether he can reduce the water charges in this area. The other point I wanted to make is that since the intake at Katangini is very good at Thwake River, the Ministry should look for ways and means of making sure that the intake is enlarged so that water can flow  faster because there is no other source of water in that area at the moment. I am very happy because I can see the Assistant Minister for Water Development nodding. Since he is a man of action, I am sure something will be done to that effect.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other day we were told that Kiteta water Project, which had been costed by the Government at kShs.32 million, would be rehabilitated when funds become available. When are the fields going to be available? We are sure as the Assistant Minister told us the other day, that Kilimanjaro Water Project is being implemented now. Now that we know that the Minister does things, can he take it into account that as he looks for money for the second phase of Mzima Water Project, he should also look for some money to implement the Kiteta Water Project? There is a dam and what is needed is, according to what the Minister told us last time, only K3hs.32 million. If the Government could get money to implement this project, the people of Machakos would be very happy because their place is very dry. The Government has already spent zee about KShs.1.5 million in designing Kiteta Water Project.Mr. Speaker, Sir, Muoni Water Project is another very important project. We do, thank the Ministry of Water Development for the effort it has made in completing this project. The project is now complete and water is going to bedistributed to areas in Masii, Mwaia and others. Everything has been done but the filtration machiery has not been installed. That machinery is estimated at kShs.2 million. I do request the Ministry to give us money so that this water can be supplied to the people. We are very happy about what is happening  and we are sure that people below Machakos will be supplied with water from Kilima njaro Water Project.Mr. Speaker, Sir, connections are already m being made at Mulima Water Project. In fact, individuals are being asked to pay as much as KShs.7- in order to get water supplied to them. I request the Ministry to try and reduce the charges for individuals because that amount is too high and individuals cannot afford it. We request the Ministry to reduce the charges so that Mulima Water Project eh can benefit the people in that area. With those few remarks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to support.newspeech(Question of the first part of the amendment, that the words to be inserted be inserted, proposed)newspeechMR. SPEAKER: Yes, Prof. Sumbi.newspeechnewspeechME. SHIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I had been called to contribute to the Motion. Does it mean that I am going to wait again?newspeechnewspeechTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CULTURE ALTO SOCIAL SERYICSS(Prof. Sumbi): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hope that the hon. Member will wait until I make my small contribution to this Motion.Sir, I thank the hon. Mover of this Motion because the importance of water can never be overemphasised. The source of Msima Springs water is Kyulu Hills, and we, the people of Kibwezi, thank God for giving us a source of five rivers which are all year round. When the Ministry of Water Development gets funds to put up a second water pipe to Mombasa, I would request them to consider constructing reservoirs at the highest point of these rivers. I have in mind rivers Kiboko, Makindu, Kibwezi, Thange, Kambu and Mtito Andei whose water emanates from Kyulu Hills. It will be a very good service if reservoirs are put up at the highest point of these rivers so that water can flow through the ridges. The wananchi in that area who, as I stated here sometime back, grow a lot of horticultural crops for export to Europe and elsewhere would benefit a lot. If such reservoirs, are put up, then water will be able to pass over the ridges and wananchi will be able to grow more horticultural crops and increase our foreign exchange.newspeechnewspeechTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES (Prof. Sumbi)(ctd.):earnings as well as growing food for their own domestic consumption. So, thatexercise of laying a second water pipe to Mombasa could be done at the same timewhen these reservoirs are being created.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I take this opportunity to appeal to my constituentsand other people who burn charcoal around and on Kyulu Hills to stop it because ifthe trees on this hill are cut down, that may make these rivers dry up and evenaffect Msima Springs. I hope people in that area will understand that. It is veryannoying and, in fact, the Kachakos District Development Committee has already banned the transportation of charcoal from Kibwezi. We know that most of the charcoal comesfrom trees cut down on Kyulu Hills. There is no more transportation of charcoalfrom Kyulu Division to Nairobi. However, even after the district developmentcommittee banned the burning of charcoal in that area, every night you find about2 to 3 lorries transporting charcoal from the same area to Nairobi. If thiscontinues, Mzima Springs will not have any water and Mombasa will suffer and alsothe people of Kibwezi will suffer. The hon. Member for Butere may think that I amout of order to mention this, but I want to show that if trees on Kyulu Hills arecut down, we may not, in future, have any water emanating from Kyulu Hills. If the trees are all cut down, one day we will not have any water coming from Mzima Springs to Mombasa.Mr. Speaker, Sir, That is very important. Another point which I would like to raise in connection with this Motion, is the second phase of Kikumbulyu Water Project. The first phase was financed by the European Economic Community, and it is now complete. We, the people of Kibwozi Division, Machakos District, are now waiting for funds and the commencement of the second of Kikumbulyu Water Project.Through you, Sir, I would like to request the Minister to hasten the acquisition of those funds from whoever will be the next donor. They should request for these funds so that the second phase of Kikumbulyu Water Project can be started. It is important because it has been proposed that Machakos District will be sub-divided and he Headquaters will be at Makindu. In essence, this second phase, will be able to feed the Headquarters of the new district and the entire district as at and when it becomes functional.I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Minister for Water Development and his staff for a good they have done in one of thedriest areas in the country, that is, Machakos District. I would also liketo thank them, on behalf of my constituents in Kibwezi and Makueni for havingstarted 18 relatively small water projects during my tenure as a Member of Parliament for that area. They have done a good job and those projects would have been completed if reservoirs are created and furrows dug like the ones found in Meru. I have been to Mitunguu where water flows all the time which makes it possible for people to grow all sorts of crops. That is why Meru District never experiences food shortage as Kibwezi and Makueni Divisions of Machakos District and Kitui District. We hope that most people will be sympathetic with the semi-arid areas.His Excellency the President mentioned the importance of waterwhen we were at Loitokitok. He said, he even foresees, one day water beingpumped from Lake Victoria to Timboroa and make the entire. Kenya, arable land.We are praying and hoping that this will take place one day. This is an opporÂ¬tune time, and I am urging the Minister and his staff to take action at this time when almost all countries of the world, would be ready if requested, to come to our aid in terms of development projects. If the Ministry can re-double their efforts, that dream night come to pass, that is, by the year 2 water will be available either in every home or close to the home. This means that clean water for human consumption, for use by animals and for irrigation willbe available. With those few comments, I beg to support.newspeechnewspeechMR. SHIKUKU: Asante sana, Bw.

Member for havingprepared this Motion at the right time. Mr. Speaker. Sir, I stand to support this Motion becauseit tries to improve the necessary water supply to the M Mainlandof Mombasa. Most of the plans which were done some time back,and which are still in use, are outdated since the populationhas gone up to the that the water supply now is no longerenough. In view of that, this Motion deserves to be supported.to meet the needs of the people Increasing the water supply to meet the needs of the people at the moment is relevant, and I would like to urge the Ministry of water Development to see to it that we do not wait until we have acute problems. We know very well that the population is continuing to go up all the time and, therefore, we should have long-term plans because if we base our plans on the present population, after a few years, those plans will be outdated. So, we should have long-term plans for areas like Mombasa, where we expect the population to go up very rapidly. Mr. Speaker, Sir, without water it is very difficult to havea reasonable sanitation, particularly in highly-populated areas. Mombasa, in the has been notorious with problems of cleanliness, and this is one of the that we should to improve the sanitation in  Mombasa area. I am sure that if we have good supply of water in that area, definitely, we shall also be improving the economy in that particular area. If we have reasonable amount of water many people are able to practise horticulture farming. They can grow various vegetables which will improve the economy in that particular area. If the economy is good enough, it will also improve the employment problems from the area because some people will be able to employ some people for various jobs.Mr. Speaker, Sir, while supporting this Motion, I would alsolike to mention something about the plastic pipes which are being used currently in most parts of the country. They are used mainlybecause they are cheaper than the metal ones. While agreeing thatthey are cheap, I am afraid that quite a number of them are beingdestroyed by moles. I would like to urge the Ministry to consultthe manufacturers to see to it that they try to discourage the moles from destroying the possibly by adding some chemicals to them, or think of what to do about them. I have seen in my constituency some of the pipes have been destroyed by moles. Meanwhile, maybe I would urge, the Minister to see to it that when they are laying down these pipes under the ground, then they should lay them deep enough to go beyond the surface of the moles otherwise we are just wasting a lot of them now.Mr. Speaker, Sir, another thing I would like to mention while supporting this Motion is about metres. The metres which are fitted to show the amount of water somebody uses in a given time should be as accurate as possible. We have had complaints from wananchi who are made to pay even when the taps have been dry. There are also complaints I do not know how true this can be  from wananchi that some of the metres can even measure the wind. When the wind blows through the pipes, the metre just continues to show some reading. This should be corrected.Mr. Speaker, Sir, while still supporting this Motion, I would like to urge the Government, particularly the Ministry of Water Development, to see to it that we utilise as much as possible the rain water, particularly along the hills. We should actually build dams which would stop the water from running very quickly to the ocean. If we did that, some of the areas along those rivers can also have water easily by gravitation. We do not even have to use the machines so that we can save the machines for the areas where gravitation can work.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also urge the Ministry of water Development to see to it that we have reasonably small water so that wananchi who arc on hilly areas can easily use them to get water supplies to their homes. Meanwhile, such do not seem to be available, and the ones which are available seem to be too big. We should have small ones for wananchi.Mr. Speaker, Sir, also along some of these rivers like the one we are talking about, we have some waterfalls which are not yet utilised. We have problem of water all along, and this problem does not seem to be decreasing. Actually, it is increasing; it is not going down. The problem of water is increasing as the population is going up all the time. Even the land is becoming scarce. Where we used to run away from it, we have no alternative but to improve such areas so that we can utilise them. Therefore, the only way to do so at the beginning is to get water into such areas. So, waterfalls arePoints where we can easily get water by using runs and then get.newspeechnewspeechMR. KOSKE (Contd.): water supplied to some areas.With those few remarks, Sir, I support the Motion.newspeech newspeechMR. MBORI: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me this chance to join my friends on this very important Motion. My gratitude goes to the Mover of the Motion, hon. Kiliku, for having brought this Motion. I also wish to thank the entire House for having removed that bit of the amendment which had been introduced, and which was going to make the Motion "null and void". I am grateful because the House is here for the welfare of the entire community, or the society of Kenya.Mr. Speaker, Sir, three aspects can be seen in this Motion.One, there is water flowing through Mzima Water Pipeline to Mombasa which is an existing water supply. The next aspect is that there is a rise in the consumption of water along this water pipeline as a result of an increase in the demand of rater, and also as a result of an increase in industries and also population.Mr. Speaker, Sir, what do we need water for? We need waterfor these purposes; industries, and use by the population, or by the people themselves, the Kenyans who are living along this water pipeline. There are other domestic demands. For instance, cooking, washing, and watering the animals and so on. These are very important uses of water, and this Motion asks for a response to that.Then the third aspect of the Motion is asking us to look at Mzima Water Pipeline. The supply of water along the single water pipeline is not enough. This Motion is asking for an additional water pipeline to be able to meet the demands of the people who live along this area, the livestock and so on. I may not mention wildlife, but I believe that Kenya gives a lot of importance to wildlife. The domestic animals that use this water, if there is an additional water pipeline, I am sure the supply will be enough.Mr. Speaker. Sir, all that the Ministry of Water Development requires is not extra funds, or asking for funds to be made available. The Ministry of Water Development needs do one thing. We have a saying in English:  "Where there is a will there is a way". This House has a will through the hon. Members of Parliament who represent the entire Kenya. It is a will to serve the people of Kenya with water. The Ministry of Water Development should have a will, and there will be a way to provide water to these Kenyans who live along the Mzima Water Pipeline towards Mombasa. There should be a will to serve the people. There will also be funds made available because where there is a will there is a way. Funds will be made available, and this House always makes funds available every year. Every year that we talk of the Budget, this House usually provides funds for purposes of water.Mr. Speaker, Sir, this House is great. The supreme authority of this land lies in this House. The august House is the one that august what should be done so that we could have the Ministry of Water Development. I remember this was done way back in 1974 when the Department of Water used to belong to the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development. It is this very House that enacted a Bill which enabled the creation of the Ministry of Water Development.newspeech	newspeechMR. MBQRI (CTD.): Today, we have the Ministry of Hater Development which should be here to stay in order to serve wananchi, including our friends who live along Mzima Water Pipeline.  There are enough funds, and all we need to do is to provide a way of getting the water there.It is in the policy of the Ministry of Water Development that by the year 2..., there will be piped water in every home in the country, My simple arithmetic tells me that we have only about 13 years to go before we reach the year 2... when we should have water everywhere.Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a shame that some of us come from areas where we have not seen piped water. We live very close to water supplies. One of the most fresh water is supplied by Lake Victoria. Those of us who live near Lake Victoria are not near leave alone the 13 more years to come and talk of 2. years to come piped water system, I just wonder when the Ministry of water Development intends to give us a water supply, particularly of piped water. Piped water is treated and properly controlled to ensure that it is free of disease terms and other impurities, I would like to say that the Ministry should work, not for piped water. Let the water be un piped, untreated, and so on. In the language of water science, this is called "raw water". Let us get raw water from whatever source it may be so that dry districts, particularly which suffer from acute droughts, have some water. Let there be some water for human and livestock consumption, instead of talking of piped water being provided by the year 2..., before which we have only 13 years to go. Where will that piped water come from then? This is just a Motion which is trying to assist the Ministry of later Development to increase the supply of water so that wananchi throughout Kenya get water. Perhaps, this is just a short-cut- towards getting piped water in the year 2..., when we expect that homes, livestock, people and industries will receive the water they require for their services, At the moment, this Motion is assisting the Ministry of Water Development, So, this Ministry should see no sense at all in opposing it. The Ministry should help the House to make the Motion sail through so that many parts of Kenya get piped water nearer where they are. In my opinion, we need water; it does not matter where this water comes from. Whether it comes from the hills, the lakes or the rivers, we should have some sort of water supply, particularly in those dry districts which suffer from acute droughts. This water will be used for human and livestock consumption, and other purposes. We should not merely wait for piped water. To me, getting piped water looks very distant.The Ministry of Water Development should assign some of its projects properly. There are projects from district development committees throughout the country which the Ministry talks about. The Ministry also talks of certain projects which are of a national nature. When will these projects be executed and put to use? The policy of the Ministry is certainly being by-passed by time. It is tine the Ministry sought even the help of other authorities, such as, the Lake Basin Development Authority in Nyanza and Western province. They can be used in helping to dig some wells so that we may get water for home consumption by human beings and livestock. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the Ministry should be in a position to help people in this area. We are merely asking the Ministry to lay an additional water pipeline from Mzima to Mombasa to augment the present water supply.. This will adequate to serve the increased water consumption on West Mainland where there are several industries and a large population. With these few remarks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the Motion.newspeechMR. MUTISO: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I will be very brief because I can see we are running out of time First of all I would like to say that I am very grateful to the House for having removed the impediment which was in this Motion, which made it almost impossible for me to support the Motion.Mr. Speaker, Sir, this expression, "When funds become available" is too lose. We know that this is another method used by the Ministries to reject Motions. This is because there will be not time ever when there will be enough money. We should not look forward to a time when somebody will sit down and say "Now, the funds are available and we can implement these projects." This is because money will never be enough.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank His Excellency the President for having seen it fit to create a Ministry to specifically handle water problems in this country. He knows precisely that many parts of this country are dry and that water is greatly needed in those areas. That is why he has appointed a particular Minister to tackle water problems in this country Therefore I would urge the new Minister for Water Development to see to it that he considers this issue of water problems in Mombasa very seriously. This is Mombasa Town is the gateway to this country. Also the Port of Mombasa links Kenya with the rest of the world.newspeechnewspeechMR. MUTISO (ctd): Secondly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Mombasa is our second largest town and thirdly Mombasa is our most popular holiday resort. So, you will find that the present water supply to Mombasa, as stated in this Motion, is quite inadequate. This is because thousands of people flock to Mombasa during the months of July, August and September. Also thousands of tourists from overseas come to have a good time in Kenya every year and the town of Mombasa gives them all the pleasure they needed.The town of Mombasa is growing very rapidly. Mombasa West has now become the Industrial Area of Mombasa. When the present water pipeline was laid these factors were not taken into consideration; that the town would grow very fast and that the supply of water would be overtaken by the g rapid growth of the town. It is therefore because of this reason that I now ask the Minister to consider, seriously, the possibility of laying a second water pipeline from Mzima to Mombasa so that the industrial area in Y7est Mainland can be adequately supplied with water. This will also ensure that the entire town of Mombasa has adequate supply of water. When we talk about Mombasa being our second largest town and also a popular holiday resort we should also ensure that there is adequate water in the town.So, because of this I would like to support this Motion as originally moved and ask the Minister for Water Development to take the views of this House very seriously.With those few remarks, I beg to support the Motion.newspeechnewspeechMR.

Members who have contributed in support of this Motion, especially the Back-benchers by showing the solidÂ¬arity and the togetherness we have; and also the concern we have in the problems of wananchi.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the Ministry of Water Developments will not spend a lot of money because the Mzima Water Pipeline uses the force of gravity and no pumps. I think the machines which will be there will be very few. So, I do not know why the Minister said that this will be done when funds are available. However, I now thank the hon. Members for reminding the Ministry and the Minister that the money is available in terms of millions which had been repatriated to other countries, but it is coming back here. So, I think when the Ministry will start this project, they consider also having "I" connections so that Taita Taveta and other neighbouring districts in Mombasa can have water. They should also have enough storage facilities for that water when it reaches Mombsa.

MATE (Contd.):With that correction, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the following Motion:-THAT, considering the fact that due to improved standards of Diving among Kenyans, which has been enhanced by the Governments efforts in provision of good medical and social services since Independence, life expectancy has increased considerably, resulting in many wananchi civil servants reaching the retiring age of fifty five when they are still energetic; this House urges the Government to consider increasing the mandatory retiring age for civil servants to the age of sixty.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to say that newspeechnewspeechMR. MWACHOFI: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The deletion of the last word "five" in the Motion by the Mover changes the meaning of the Motion in the sense that it is no longer saying "sixty five" but "sixty". I was wondering whether that is not a substantial amendment of a Motion and, therefore, he is moving a different Motion from the original one.newspeech newspeechMR. SPEAKER: No, I do not believe that it affects the original Motion.  Maybe that is more national than starting to argue about "part of a word" to be deleted.newspeechnewspeechMR. MATE: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to begin by thanking the Govern merit for providing adequate and good medical facilities. This is what really has increased life expectancy of our people. Since Independence, our Government has provided medical facilities almost too all the wananchi in the rural areas. Medical facilities are available to wananchi very closely. For this reason, their lives are better. They live longer because of the provision of medical services by the Government.newspeech	newspeechMR. MATS (ctd.):There are dispensaries and health centers in almost a every, part of the country, and for this reason, we thank the Government for that because these medical services have improved the living standards of our people If you look at our people, you find that they are really healthy, and even when they reach retirement age, most of them are strong and energetic and so they can do a lot of work.Mr. Speaker, Sir, we should also thank the Government for providing more-social amenities. These are to be found in the rural areas, together with the urban areas. These have also enhanced the lives of our people. There are sports fields almost everywhere in the country, and especially in this city where there are huge sport fields. This is the reason why the life expectancy of our people has gone up.The only problem there is unemployment, the number of people retiring is too small compared to that of people who are unemployed. Therefore, having them retire at the age of 55 years does not mean that we are solving the unemployment problem. At the age of 55 years, this is when most of our people have become steady in their lives. This is the time when civil servants have become efficient in their professions. This is the time when most of them have finished educating their children and have, therefore, settled down and can offer first class services to the nation. If we retire these people at this time, we lose because they go home while still very strong and in so doing, we lose their very valuable services. We should, therefore, be able to retain them and keep them in service up to the age of 6. years, because at that age, they are still young.Mr. Speaker, Sir, we know that in this House, there are some hen. Members who retired as civil servants at the age of 55 years and are still strong, Some of them even got married at the of 55 years because they are still strong. So, I am urging the Government, through this Motion, to make sure that we keep these people up to the age of 6. years because we need their services since they can offer the Government good service as n this is the time when they have settled down. Again, by retaining them in the service up to the age of 6. years} they give more guidance to those who are below them and young in the service, and still learning. So, if we retain them, they will be able to guide their young brothers and sisters in the lower job cadres for that particular period when they are there. But, if we retire them while they are still energetic, they go home and become bored and, finally, they even die earlier than might have been expected. Therefore, it would be beneficial to the whole nation to retain these people u in the service until they sire 6. years old.In the other countries of the world, people stay in theservice for a long time. In places like Great Britain and theUnited States of America, the mandatory retirement age is 65 years So, if we could have our people retire at the age of 6. years of 55 years we would be gaining from all the  sides. This is better than having them retire at the age of 55 years when they are still very young.newspeech	headerHANSARDheader Wednesday, 28th October,1987	The House met at thirty minutes past Two oclock.	The Temporary Deputy Speaker(Mr. Mutiso) in the ChairPRAYERSheaderNOTICES OF MOTIONSheadernewspeechMR.

In case Mr. Sewe did not have a Personal Number, it would be useful to know what grade he held at the time of retirement and his last working station before he retired.newspeechnewspeechMR. OTWANI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, that answer is rather shocking. This is because it is quite a number of weeks now since the Question was submitted to the Ministry.

The Ministry does not keep separate records for those who have retired as it is the responsibility of the pensions division of the Ministry of Finance. Officers records are in the officers personal files, hence, the need to know his personal number. Furthermore, the Ministry could not communicate directly with the hon. Questioner; it was actually his duty to provide the Ministry with the personal number of that employee. newspeechnewspeechMR. OTWANI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I accept that bit of my oversight, but before I give the personal number, I would like to point out that this kind of practice which, is found in nearly all offices has frustrated the wananchi quite a bit. In fact, this morning, I was in an office and just because somebody had misplaced the number I gave him last week, he asked me to go back to Busia to look for the number, yet I had given him photoÂ¬copy of it. Now, here is another case and I will therefore, appeal to all the Ministers to ask their officers to be taking a bit of trouble to look up certain things which are there in their records instead of frustrating wananchi to such an extent.

LIUTHURA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,Â£ Sir, in his reply to part (b) of the Question, the Assistant Minister says that 17 secondary schoolstudents from Laikipia District have benefited from this fund. Being  inLaikipia District does not necessarily mean that these students are from Laikipia. When I put this Question seeking to know who these students are and the schools where they come from, I did not want to know the schools they were in. I /newspeechnewspeechMR. MUTHURA (CTD.):wanted to know the primary schools from which those students have come. If the Assistant Minister has the names of the primary schools from which, these students come from, he should give out this information. If he does not have these names, could he promise to bring them here later? I want to know the names of the primary schools in Laikipia where these students come from. ./newspeechnewspeechMR. MMAITSI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Jomo Kenyatta Foundation Fund forms arc distributed to secondary schools teachers where bright children join but are unable to pay school fees, Therefore, we do not issue them through the primary schools, but through secondary schools where the children need the money./newspeechnewspeechMR. KAKEIDO: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, arising from that reply, could the Assistant Minister not agree with me that in that respect some schools in some districts might go without getting any financial help while others might end up getting a class  of students who come from the same area benefiting from the Fund and, as such the Fund is not equally spread all over the districts as arranged by the Ministry?/newspeechnewspeechMR, MMATISI; Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, theforms are sent to all secondary schools where they are filled in andapplications considered. So, if a child came from one district and was posted to another district, the secondary school in that district would forward his name, if there is the need to assist./newspeechnewspeechMR. MUTIIURA: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. You can see the reason why I raised this Question. If the Assistant Minister says that the forms are sent to secondary schools for the headmasters, possibly, to pick on the students who should benefit from the Fund, then you can see that there is a possibility of some students not benefiting from the Fund, althoughtheir parents are very poor. In 1985 /newspeechnewspeechTHE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER: (Mr. Mutiso) : What is your point of order?/newspeechnewspeechMR. MUTHURA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, my point oforder is that the Ministry is unfair in the way it does this. If, forexample, these students are s considered in Laikipia District, but do not come from there, would it not be unfair since the students hailingfrom Laikipia District would not have benefited from that bursary? There might be very /newspeechnewspeechMR. MUTHUR.A (ctd.):	many who sometimes cannot go to Form One since their parents cannot afford the fees.

I appreciate the gesture by the High Court of reducing the sentence to one month; and 27 days. How does ho compare it with the case where some people have stolen millions of shillings in this Republic and have got scot free, and some were sentenced to three years sentences? How does he work out his mathematics? If he works it out at one month and 27 days, multiply it with the millions of shillings that other people have stolen, then would he not agree with me that the small man in this country has different justice from the big men who steal more? Does he not agree with me on that?/newspeech	newspeechMr. MULI: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker , Sir , I do notagree with the hon. Member, especially, on the last sentenced. Itis absolutely wrong to infer that there is a justice for some people. We do not have different sort of classes of people. What may have gone wrong, and it does go wrong quite often, is what we call the uniformity of sentence by different courts and the High Court tries to do its best to balance this. In this case, the contempt, or the amount that was the subject matter of the charge, may be small, but circumstances the surrounding it, could have caused a lot of harm to the victim. As I have explained, the circumstances amounted really to robbory./newspeechnewspeechMR. SHIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. The Attorney General! has not replied to the question had asked him about the mathematics, because I know as ho /newspeechnewspeechMR. SHIKUKU (ctd.):: and everybody in this Republic knows that there are people who have been sent to court,, for stealing millions and only ended up being sentenced and in personal for two years, throe years and so on. But, in this case, this man has taken 3=. He stole from somebody, but did not rob him. They have not said that he robbed him using violence. The case was not robbery with violence. He stole the money. So, the Attorney General should not mislead this House, Could he tell this House the reason for this disparity as far as justice in this country is concerned? Many people know this, although they are not lawyers. Even by reading this, I had known that this man had not been given the right justice, and the High Court now confirms my feelings. This is because you do not have to be a judge to know whether justice has been done or not./newspeechnewspeechMR. MULI: After all that lecture, Mr. Temporary DeputySpeaker, Sir, I have a reply to the hon. Member on the specific point he is making. In the first place, offences do defer. I never said the offence was robbery with violence. What I gave were the circumstances surrounding this particular incident, which amounted to robbery, which carries a maximum sentence of seven years. Robbery with violence is a more serious offence which carries a mandatory death sentence. So, these are two different categories of sentences. In the case of stealing, this was a substitute of a lesser offences from which I said the accused benefited, as he could have been charged with attempted I robbery. On the other question of disparity, courts do sit in different places, no doubt, and each judge, or magistrate, presented with different sets of circumstances, may. issue a sentence without knowing what the other one did. I did say specifically that the High Court is there as a superviÂ¬sory jurisdiction to remove these, disparities. This is done after day. I do not agree that by comparing contempt of shs.3= and that one of millions of shillings does indicate that there is separate justice for one class of persons and different justice for another.

Later on  both the wife and the husband came to the Tombe Leaf Base and Mr. Mageto Ogechi agreed in writing that during the 1985 bonus, he was given Shs.4,13335, money that belonged to his wife by mistake. He accepted that the money be recovered from his 1986 bonus payments and the payments be made to his wife.

The specific services will be provided by the various departments catered for in these votes which include land administration, land adjudication and human settlement and surveying of lands.Hon. Members will no doubt agree that the production of wealth emanates from the land, and that we require land, tools and the human exertion to provide this we are all workers. This means that we have to develop our country to such an extent that all in the country will benefit from the land. Land is, therefore, a commodity which is necessary. However, I would like to say here that it is also a commodity which does not increase.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, k hon. Members will./newspeechnewspeechTHE MINISTER FOE LANDS AND SETTLEMENT (ctd.): be fully aware that the land on which we live and which we develop and on which we invest, is a necessary thing, and whatever funds or investments that we use, be it public, private or corporate, are spent in order to develop and improve the well being of our people.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, with your permission,would like to briefly recapitulate on the main functions of the Ministry before I go on to the expenditure for the Ministry.Land is a central natural resource that is why is it was a criticalissue during the struggle for  Independence. Indeed, matters to do with it have since continued to occupy the minds of themajority of the people.Right from the outset, the Ministry of lands and Settlementwas charged with sp some specific responsibility. The first wasthe transformation of land ownership within the former nonscheduled areas from cognates system of land tenure to statutoryfreehold tenure, through an accelerated programme of consolidation,adjudication and registration, so as to create security of tenureand provide incentives for better use of land and dace developÂ¬ment.	The second was to transfer the ownership from within formerly scheduled areas from foreigners to Kenyans, through a programme of land purchase and s resettlement to reduce the problem of landlessness and unemployment in the country and to give the landless and the unemployed an opportunity to contribute towards the development of agricultural productivity which they have done.The third was to provide land within urban areas atreasonable costs for development for residential, commercial industrial and special purposes in order to alleviate the shortage /newspeechnewspeechTHE MINISTER FOR LANDS AND SETTLEMENT (ctd.):of residential accommodation in urban areas to facilitate commercial and industrial development of the country. We need industrialÂ¬ization.The fourth was to ensure proper land use and administration in accordance with existing legislation on land use. All theseobjectives were to be achieved through the sister departments I have already mentioned. The Lands Department, therefore, is charged with the responsibility Â£ of land administration activities, management, supervision and control of privately owned free hold land by means of statutory law and administrative regulations.The Division of Settlement, on the other hand, was formedand charged with the responsibility of facilitating the purchase of formerly foreign owned areas and resettlement of indigenous Kenyans through the settlement fund trustees. The Division has, so far, settled some 95,355 landless families on 828,51 hectares of arable land and the Ministry is currently engaged in the preparation of title deeds for all the plot holders.Sir, I may add here that as often as you hear the Presidentspeak, he has charged the Ministry with the responsibility of makingsure that the shareholders get their title deeds. Even now, my Ministry is engaged with that job. Then the exercise, is completed, we hope the ultimate result will be the acceleration of development in those areas.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Division of LandAdjudication, which is charged with the responsibility of acceleratorthe land adjudication programme throughout the Republic, is still busy carrying out the exercise to date. 1,282,81 parcels of land, comprising of 6,518,618 hectares have been registered, of which 369 are group ranches covering 55,946 group members.For the information of the House, adjudication has already./newspeechnewspeechTHE MINISTER FOR LANDS AND SETT1EMENT (ctd.):been completed in Kiambu, Nyeri, Muranga, Kirinyaga, Kakamega,Bungona, Kicii and Laikipia Districts, while work is still inprogress in Kilifi, Kwale, Taita Tavcta, Meru, Embu, Kitui, Machakos, Kajiado, Kisumu, Narok, Samburu, Baringo, West Pokot,Elgeyo Llarslawet, Handi, Kericho, South Nyanza, Siaya and BusiaDistricts. We say the work is still in progress but somesections have already got their title deeds. It is the intentionof the Ministry to complete the exercise throughout the country.The Survey Department, on the other hand, is chargedwith the responsibility of carrying out survey work as precisesurvey is a prerequisite to ownership and development of land. The surveys done include those required for land registration and development, plans for urban centres and markets, water projects and so on./newspeechnewspeechTHE MINISTER FOR LANDS AND SETTLEMENT (Ctd.):The Department, consequently produce deed plans, registry index maps to support land registration and also makes topographical maps of the whole, country. It also carries out cadastral surveys, land adjudication surveys and geodetic and mapping survey, all of which are necessary and prerequisite to any development of land.Of late, my Ministry has been seriously involved in updating the various Acts to bring them in line with present and future developments. The conversion of the document formerly known as Land Certificate to Title Deed, as required by a recent amendment to the appropriate law has been completed . Secondly, following the recent amendment to the s survey Act, arrangements are at sis advanced stages to produce more licenced and qualified surveyors for the much needed survey work in the country. It was only last week when we had a Question in this House concerning the surveyors.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, plans are also underway to establish a Survey of Kenya Training School at Ruaraka near Nairobi. which at one time was closed,. As much as to this effect, presentation has already made to the Treasury and the Ministry officials have gone to Japan for assistance. Thirdly, the Government has just published the Sectional Properties Bill. When it becomes law the new Act will facilitate the registration of properties and sections of buildings so that such properties will have separate titles., This move will create enormous opportunities for title deed holders to secure credit forincreased development and guaranteed security of tenure.Sir, on the other hand, all is motyplaint sailing because the Ministry has serious shortages in some areas in respect of vehicles and funds for running expenses in respect of vehicles and travelling as well as for survey equipment. With regard to development programmes, we badly need additional funds for purchase of land for industrial purposes as well as for Government estates development fund for construction of infrastructures in new estates. Representation has already been made to the Sees Ministry of Finance. We hope that this will be considered during supplementary estimates as requested above./newspeechnewspeechTHE MINISTER FOR LANDS AND SETTLEMENT (Ctd.):Sir, before I turn to expenditure side, let me state that manpower is always needed. From the few remarks that I have just made, the House will agree with me that we need manpower with appropriate knowledge. Let me also take this opportunity to thank the officers in the Ministry working under me for their hard work.Sir, I do not wish to bore the House with the details of the Vote, as. I no doubt believe, the hon. Members have studied the details in the printed estimates. However, I will go over it quickly now. Recurrent Estimates under Sub Vote 316. Ministry Headquarters a gross amount of KÂ£863,848 is required. We will raise KÂ£1 as Appropriations in Aid but KÂ£868,48 will raised From the Exchequer. Under Sub Vote 361, Division of Land Adjudication, a gross amount of kÂ£5,26,745 will be required for land adjudication and consolidation purposes in the 2 districts under the adjudication jurisdiction programme.	Hon.

We hope to raise the Appropriations to Â£11,4 leaving Â£5,249,345 to be drawn from the Exchequer. Under Sub Vote 362f Division of Settlements the Exchequer is required to provide Â£1,384,864 to run the settlement headquarters and districtsÂ® The Department will administer settlement schemes in lands bought by the Government after independence and then divide then to landless Africans.

Under Vote 362 Division of Settlements, we will require a total of KÂ£2,572,84 which will be utilized under the following Heads: Coast Settlement Projects Magarini which is in Nalindi and where, as I said, we have already settled 1,26 families and we are yet to settle 4,4 families. The plots which are given have an acreage of 3 across each and here, we have got assistance from the Australian Government and we are now working on the State Land and Trust Land../newspeechnewspeechTHE MINISTER FOR LANDS AND SETTLEMENT (ctd):Under the expanded settlement schemes and settlement funds trustees, where 145 schemes were done over the past years under a one million acre programme and beyond, KÂ£2, will be required for mopping up operations.Under Shirilea Settlement schemes sir, we wi11 require KÂ£14,7. Shirika Settlement Schemes are those where the Settlement used to run farm, operations under co-operatives. These are now being phased out and we require that amount to complete the exercise,.Under Haraka Settlement Schemes, KÂ£74, is required. This is part of European farms which we took over under the Agriculture Act. All in all, there are 35 schemes and we require KÂ£Â£74, to see this exercise through. Under State land Schemes, we require KÂ£454,3.

Maintenance of roads in urban areas will require KÂ£45, and residential areas in Nairobi will require KÂ£1,.As I said before, I do not wish to bore the n House with the details of the Vote as no-doubt, I believe the hon. Members have studied the details in the Printed Estimated and an opportunity would be available at the Committee Stage for any clarification which might be sought on details. It is my hope that the House will approve the Vote to enable the Ministry to render and deliver these vital services to our people.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move./newspeechnewspeechTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENERGY AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Kwicigi) Mr. Temporary Deputy. Speaker, Sir, I would like to second the Motion. The Minister has clarified the position in the Ministry of Lands and Settlementand special efforts have been made in that Ministry to achieve what they haveachieve to date. They have worked hard and they have plans and are nowthinking about land adjudication, survey and so on. The efforts they havemade should be considered. We are grateful to the Minister for the way inwhich he frankly and truthfully explained the position in his Ministry. Thereis a lot to be done in that Ministry because of the nature ties we have inconnection with land. This is so particularly when it comes to title deeds. It is true a lot of efforts have been made and the Minister has explained that they will continue to do so. What we would like to ask is that special efforts should be made to ensure that more title deeds are released at a much faster rate than what is happening at the moment./newspeechnewspeechTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENERGY AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT(Mr. Mwicigi) (contd.):There are problems all over the country, and they are continuing to build up because people are not quite happy with the time it takes them to get the title deeds.The other thing I would like to mention is that there are a lot of land disputes in the districts, divisions, and in the chiefs centres. You can find some cases pending in the district officers office for a period of two years without either the land adjudication officer or the land surveyor coming to sort out the disputes. If it is a matter involving families then this delay, can have serious consequences. If two brothers are complaining about the boundaries of their fathers land, or if they want to sub-divide it, so that each one of them can have his own piece, and the matter is left hanging for two years without the issue being solved; what consequences would you expect? There will be pains; there will be cries; and fights. These things are actually happening. If it is q. question of increasing the staff to see that problem is sorted out, I would ask the Minister again to put special efforts to see that land disputes are sorted out in good time.We were also debating about qualified surveyors. You findthat some of the bottle necks are being created by lack of surveyorsThe qualification which is required is somewhat too high, particularwhere African are concerned. The duration is too long, and yet we have so many graduates, who do not require so many years moving around with instruments such as the dilutes in the fields in order to gain experience. They have done a lot of theoretical work: their time should be shortened so that they can come out, and join the profession, and decrease the crises which we are facing and reduce the bottle necks that we experience when it comes to the question of title deeds./newspeechnewspeechTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR. ENERGY AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Mwicigi)(contd.):Another issue which has been discussed here extensively involves the availability of title deeds. Somebody may have a building with ten storeys or ten flats, and may want to sell it in units. There should be a law allowing somebody to buy a unit of flat within the same building. This is being done elsewhere, like Europe, And America. It can also be done here to allow somebody who does not have a lot of money to possess a dwelling place in the City of Nairobi, Mombasa, or elsewhere. Let there be some arrangements so that title deeds can be available for a flat, and the same title deed can also act as a security if one wants to borrow money. .There is also something interesting which is happening in our cities when it comes to allocation of properties such as land. We do not seem to be reserving enough land for public utilities. People want to possess all the land when allocation of land is being done. When land h for a hospital, a police station, a bank or a clinic, is required, we find that there is no land because all the land has been taken by individuals./newspeechnewspeechTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENERGY AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Mwicigi) (Contd.):So, let us have play grounds set aside and not being negoÂ¬tiable for resale or possession by an individual. Let us consider the future. Let us think of the generations to come. There must also be open places for them. It does not mean that any open places within the City of Nairobi must be possessed by somebody. Let us think of the entire population and the entire community because that will be important in future instead of buying the same land to look for a field for children to play about.Sir, I also want to stress that the current problems we have in the City of Nairobi are also going to be spread to Mombasa, Kisumu Kakuru, Nyeri and everywhere else, including Thika. When people have been given permission to put lip a building in the City, there is no parking space allocation allowed. In other words, there should be a law to the effect that a building of so many storeys should have a certain proportion of a parking space in the same building. There should be even a building whose first five storeys are parking spacesToday, particularly in the City of Nairobi on Saturdays, there are more vehicles than the parking spaces available. There are a lot of policemen on that day. I do not know where they come from. There is a special force to remove vehicles from wherever they have been parked because there are no parking spaces, or parking areas are not enough. Why does the planner not insist that every building, whether Government, commercial, and so on, should have a certain portion of parking space constructed within the building in relation to the number of people who will be occupying that building. So, it is very important that that should be done because we have to think about the future.My last point, Sir, is that the land which is so valuable isGetting make today it has no moisture. It has been left open to /newspeechnewspeechASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENERGY AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Mwicigi) (Contd.):be destroyed by the sun, wind, rain and so on. Whatever value the land had before, it has become less and less. Also, in the same land, rivers are drying up. I should feel that even construction of dums should also be a part of land utility, or land value. There should be enough water when we have droughts. There should be enough water available. Covering of that land should also be a matter of great importance.Sir, with those few remarks, I beg to second the Motion. ( Question proposed)/newspeechnewspeechMR. KARAURI: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy SpeakerSir, for giving me an opportunity to contribute this Motion.First of all, I would, like to thank the Minister for Lands and Settlement because I can see a lot of progress in my constituency in the area of land demarcation. Land adjudication started in Tigania that is my constituency in i96, and it is surprising that up to now the exercise has not been completed; 22 years after the start of it. However, there has been some progress of late. Land demarcation is starting in several places. . The only thing remaining now is for the Minister to expedite the exercise, and perhaps urge hisofficers to speed up. Some of us have suffered quite a lot. We havenot had any title deeds with which we can borrow money for development. We have been unable to plan our shambas such that we do not know where we should build a house, where we should plant trees, where we should keep cattle and so on. If the Minister hastens this exercise my people will benefit by the bank loans. They will plan their shambas properly, and perhaps even plant more trees. Today, it is so difficult to do so because we do not know when land demarÂ¬cation comes whether it will favour you with the land you are usedto where you have been living all the time, where jour grandfathers./newspeechnewspeechMR. KARAURI (Contd.):used to live, and so on. But if we are given title deeds and shown our shambas, that problem will be solved, and we will feel like other Kenyans. We shall be free to borrow money from banks and so on.Sir although I have commended the Minister for starting land demarcation in many places in tigania there are about four locaÂ¬tions where land adjudication has not been started at all. These are Gigo, Kuaati, Igarie, Mbeu and Mituntu.. These people also want their areas to be declared "adjudication areas" because the problems they are facing are enormous. This includes the fact that if there is land dispute where an area has not been "an adjudication area", it is the chief with his Agambi or elders that he has appointed himself who listen to the cases. When that is being done, anything can happen. If you are not friendly to the chief ./newspeechnewspeechAN HON. MEMBER: It always happens!/newspeechnewspeechMR. KARAURI: It." always happens! I agree with the hon. Member because I know. If you are not friendly to the chief, you are likely to lose your land. Some of the chiefs have become political. So, if they do not support a particular hon. Member, anybody supporting that particular hon. Member will lose his land case. We would like the Minister to take care of those areas that have not been declared "adjudication areas" also. I think it should be his responsibility. All land in this country should be under the Minister for Lands and Settlement so that land cases are not heard by the chiefs and the people he has picked up" but by a land officer plus a committee chose by the people themselves.Sir, more important, I would like the Minister to declare those remaining areas of Tigania "adjudication areas" to remove those problems.Sir, there is urgent need to review land laws in Kenya. It has been said before that they are in several parts. They should be /newspeechnewspeechMR. KARAURI (Contd.):put together But the point I want to raise here is that the powers that the district land adjudication officer has are enormous. When the district land adjudication officer hears your case and decides on that case, then the only place you can appeal to is to the Minister When the lion. Minister stands up here to reply, he can perhaps tell us how many cases he has heard because I have not heard of a Minister hearing a land case.  The law requires that that is the final resort, but then people keep on appealing to the Minister. They wait and wait until they see that somebody else has been allocated the land which they had a case against, and then the matter ends up there. I do not know whether the Minister could perhaps tell us how many cases hehas ever heard or even his predecessors? Which Minister heard whichcase because I do not think since Independence an3r Minister has heard more than two cases? There should be a law reform in that direction, so that the decision taken by the committee is final.Sir, some of our people decide on these cases very fairlybecause of the traditional fear of the oaths that are taken For instance, if I had a land case against you that I was disputing the ownership of land that you have, the final resort in Moru is to slaughter a he-goat when you are naked. You go round your shamba swearing that that is your shamba, and that he-goat is cut in several places. For instance, you are told that if you are stealing the land, 3our ears will be cut off like the ears of that he-goat. All the parts of the body, including the private parts are mentioned in this matter. So, traditionally, it is a fearful custom. But when you give the district land adjudication officer the final say, and he comes, and settles the case contrary to what the ciders felt, it is wrong. That is why I am saying that there should be a law reform in that direction so that the elders elected by the people and also from that area have the final say in that case./newspeechnewspeechMR. KARAURI (CTD):	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker Sir, another problem that we experience in my Tigania Constituency pertains to the kind of land adjudication which was done}there. It was in form of gathering pieces of land here and finally putting them together. What is surprising is that sifter the adjudication vexerci.se people are "being Eh given infertile and rocky places, which their grandfathers, or anybody in their lineage, never saw. It is the richer people who whisper to the land officers and they get better land. Somebody else occupies your piece of land where you have been living since your grandfathers days; you areremoved from there and taken to an infertile, rocky and sloppy area. This practice must stop the Minister must insist that his officers do not remove people from their land. In any case, it a requirement of the law that if you are removed from your piece of land you must be shown similar piece of land.  This is unavoidable because gathering of pieces of land resultsin people pushing one another so that you do not finally settle in the particular place where you have always lived. However, if you have to be moved, you must be moved to a similar piece of land; you should not be moved from a very fertile place, where you have been growing coffee and tea, to a rocky place, where you cannot grow even potatoes. What happens is that those who axe poorer suffer consequence. This practice must be stopped.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I recall in June this year whilereplying to my Question in this House, an Assistant Minister in this Ministry promised that Athwana people would get their title deeds by the end of July. In fact, I did ask the Assistant Minister who was replying to the Question, hon. Muturi whether I would ask my people to go 1 the land office, Meru, and collect their title deeds by around 5th of August, and he said that they could go to that land office and collect their title deeds at the end of August. It is now almost the end of October, and there no title deeds in that office./newspeechnewspeechAN HON. MEMBER: Did you tell them to go for them?/newspeechnewspeechMR. KARUARI: I did not tell ray people to go to the a lands office to collect their title deeds, but they heard it over the radio, when Voice of Kenya./newspeechnewspeechMR. KARAURI (CTD):reported the reply I had got from the Ministry for Question. So, the Minister must always honour his promises to this Souse and the people of this country so asto maintain that integrity of the Government and the Minister. So, I hope thatafter a few days my people will be able to go the lands office, Meru, and collect their title deeds.Kr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, another strange phenomenon that must be discussed in this House concerns the shanties, which are coming up in and around Nairobi. As a result of no planning at all, plots are being sold everywhere toco-operative societies and individuals. Now, what is happening is that youhave bought a plot you put up a house of your choice. You can put up whatever kindof house you want; it does not matter whether it has three doors; what kind ofroof it has; or how big the rooms are. Is there nothing that can be done about this situation? Do we not have any planning? When a people buy these plots, they should be given plans of specific, types of houses that should be put up on such plots. There is a danger of having shanties all over Nairobi due to lack of planning. I know that this is not entirely the responsibility of the Minister for Lands and Settlements; the matter also involves the Ministry of Works, Housing and Physical planning. However, with his assistance, they can be able to plan for this.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the Motion. MR. GALGALLO: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, thank you very much for giving me this chance. First of all, I would like to join my colleagues in	congratulating the Minister for the way in which he has presented the requirements of his Ministry./newspeechnewspeechMR. GALGALLO (ctd.):The Ministry of Lands and Settlement plays a very important role in the developmentof this nation by way of taking care of our land, which today is the most importantthing. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, on 17th February, 1984, His Excellency the President was in Marsabit and he directed the Ministry of Lands and SettleÂ¬ment to send a survey team to Marsabit and the people of Marsabit be given an opportÂ¬unity to get title deeds so that they could, like all other Kenyans, enjoy facilities like loans from banks and other finance houses in order to develop the district. Although that team of surveyors has been sent to Marsabit, it got stuck in Maxsabit Central Division not because of problems between the people of that division but because of problems emanating from the Ministry. I do not know what problems they have. The few shambas which have been surveyed in Marsabit Distirct so far mainly belong to people who hold big offices like hon. Members of Parliament or businessmen who are very influential and rich./newspeechnewspeechThe Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Mutiso) left the Chair The Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Karauri) took the ChairIn fact, nothing is being done to survey shambas belonging to the poor people. Thepoor people are still awaiting services from the survey team which was sent to Marsabit District. Since sometimes in the middle of 1986, nothing is being done by the Department of Land Adjudication to give these essential services to wananchi in Marsabit District. There are six administrative divisions in Marsabit District, and it is only Marsabit Central Division which has had any service from the Ministry of Lands and Settlement. why is the rest of the district denied these services?/newspeechnewspeechMR. EORU: Even the exercise is not over in  Maxsabit Central. /newspeechnewspeechMR. GALGALLO: Even the hon. Member from that area is informing me that the exercise of land adjudication is not over in his place, and the otherareas are still waiting. In 1985, the Ministry had carried out the peripheral survey of Moyale town but, up to new, nothing has been done to complete the /newspeechnewspeechMR. GALGALLO (ctd.):the exercise in order to enable the people of Moyale to acquire title deeds for their plots and shambas. Despite the other problems of drought that we have experienced in these arid areas, the Ministry of Lands and Settlement is the one which is causing retrogress in this district. I am appealing to the Minister, therefore, to take argent measures to ensure that our people get these services so that they can acquire loans to enable them to expand their businesses and farms.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as hon. Karauri said in his contribution, there are the shanties which are coming up in towns without any plans. In the end, when the towns are planned, those buildings will be demolished and wananchi will suffer a lot of losses. Of course, people must live somewhere and, because the land has not been surveyed, our people have tried to live comfortably to the best of their ability. When the Ministry of Lands and Settlement starts surveying these towns, they will collaborate with the Ministry of works, Housing and Physical Planning to demolish those buildings which are now being constructed without plans. As a result, our people will suffer heavy losses. It is for this reason that I am appealing to the Minister to ensure that survey of towns and trading centres all over the country is Â£ carried out early enough in order that people do not carry out haphazard development. Proper planning must be done to provide room for public utilities. For example, if you go to Moyale town now, you find that there is no room left for public utilities. The town is not properly planned and the area has not been surveyed and, therefore, people are just puttingup buildings anyhow. The district has now been declared an adjudication area andithe people of Marsabit are waiting for the services of the Ministry of Lands and Settlement to enable them to carry out development projects in the district adequately.Sir, we are Kenyans just like everybody else, and we are wondering whywe are being denied services which are being rendered in other parts of thecountry. We should be given equal services with all other Kenyans. The services of the Ministry of Lands and Settlement, like any other services rendered by /newspeechnewspeechMR. GALGALLO (ctd.):other Ministries, should be equitably distributed all over this nation.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, sometimes when the Ministrys Departmenttof Survey is carrying out its job, it happens that the big fished swallow the small fish. I mean to say that the poor man loses his land to the rich man. We would like this matter to be looked into very seriously with a view to ensuring that justice is carried out properly. The poor man should be able to maintain the little hj? has without interference from the rich man. With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the je Motion./newspeechnewspeechTHE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. arap Cheboiwo): Ahsante sana, Bw.

MICHOMA: Thank you very much, Mr.: Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir for giving me the Floor to join my colleagues in contributing to this Motion.First of all I would like to thank the Minister for the manner in which he has conducted the affairs of this Ministry since he took over from his predecessor. This is a very important Ministry and the Minister should take serious note of what we say here.I will start by touching on permanent improvement plots in all settlement schemes in Kenya. These plots were set aside for the construction of schools, hospitals, health centres and so on These are public plots. But you will find that most of these plots all over Kenya have been allocated to people. It is the settlement officers who allocate these plots to people where will the settlers in various settlement schemes build schools, hospitals and so on? The Minister should make sure that these plots are preserved for public use.	The other point is about illegal selling and transfer of plots. The Director of Settlement, Mr. Gachanja, is here and he knows what I am talking about." I can cite one example in Molo South. If the hon. Member for Nakuru West, Mr. J.N. Mungai was here he would support me fully. I am talking about Plot No.81 in Langwena Settlement Scheme. A certain person who has a plot therewent to the land Control Board We have checked and found thatthe Chairman of the Land Control Board is a bogus one." They call him Mr. T. Muturi. No District Officer by the name of T. Muturi has </newspeech><newspeech>MR. MICHOMA (ctd);	ever been posted to Nakuru District This plot has been transferredto another parson. All the original documents were removed fromthe files. The former Settlement Officer in thatarea and other persons should "be brought to "book." I do not wishto say more about this because the case is under police investigation and I hope that the Director of Settlement, and thelegal section of that Ministry, will help this poor lady to getback her plot.The other point, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, isthat the Ministry should accelerate the land registrationexercise. I say this because "land adjudication" and "landregistration" have different meanings as far as I understand. Whenland adjudication started in Central Province some rich people gotthe opportunity to acquire acres and acres of land and the poor people were left without land. In Kisii District the exercisewas known as land registration. If Michoma had three pieces ofland these had to be registered where they were and they were never consolidated. I must thank the Minister because people in Kisii District and other places have been issued with title deeds. But the Minister should ensure that this programme is speeded up in areas like Baringo in the Rift Valley Province, North Eastern Province and Nyanza Province. The Minister should ensure that this programme is accelerated so that wananchi can get title deeds to acquire loans to do business and so on;Another point is that in these settlement schemes even if somebody has not paid his entire loan he should be given his title deed and be told to repay the loan; not a lot of money is involved.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. MICHOMA (ctd);	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as hon. arap Cheboiwo has said, not much has been done about plots in towns and market centres in this country. The Department of Physical Planning which is now under the Ministry of Works, Housing andPhysical Planning At times you will find this Department underthe Ministry of Local Government and at other times you will find it under the Ministry of Works, Housing and Physical Planning I think" this Department should be brought under the Ministry of Lands and Settlement so that planning a can be done properly. You will find that people in most rural towns are putting up buildings without any plans. A lot of buildings are mushrooming in every town in this country. These towns are never properly planned. The Minister should ensure that proper physical planning of these rural towns is done. I also note with appreciation the remarks of the Minister to the effect that there will be a training school to train surveyors. But when the Minister standsto respond to the views of hon. Members, he should tell the House how many survey students will be taken at a time. Many of them should be trained so that they can undertake survey work in this country. You, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, have talked about the shortage of qualified surveyors. How many times are we going to say that survey work should be speeded up?Hon. Members have asked Questions in this House and since the Minister is a man of action he will take serious note of this matter and ensure that this programme is speeded up. Let all Kenyans have title deeds within reasonable time.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. MICHOMA (Ctd.):Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is an Agricultural Produce Act, but there is still mismanagement. One time when there was mismanagement in the sugar belt in Nyansa, the then Minister for Agriculture, hon. Nyagah was taken to court. I think the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Lands and Settlement should put their heads together to ensure that people who own land in Kenya and yet they are not here, have their land taken away from them and "be given to indigenous Kenyans who are landless.Another point is that all the time, there has "been a squatter problem. I think there is a practice of a certain ethnic group or groups of making themselves squatters so as to get land. There is nobody in this country who does not have a place an original district  where he comes from The Minister should investigate this and if there is one ethnic group like the Kisii who pretend to be squatters when they are not, he should tell them to go back 3drs to where they came from Let the genuine landless people be p.ven land by the Ministry when land becomes availableThe other point is in connection with the x Land Control Boards. The Minister should take a serious note that these land boards members get only Sho1 per sitting. I do not know whether the Minister has now reviewed these allowances; I know he has not because I was a member of the Land Control Board until recently when I resigned,, what is Sh.1 per sitting? That is why there is "attempted" corruption. The Minister should ensure that these allowances are reviewed as thestandards of living have gone up There are so many land cases here and there. The other day His Excellency the President said that these land disputes should be heard bythe ordinary elders who know where the land boundaries are.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. MICHOMA. (Ctd.)	These elders should "be given some inducement by the Government, notThey should not always have to ask the two disputing parties to give them some posho or kiinua mgongo.With those few remarks, I beg to support </newspeech><newspeech>MR. MUTISO: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I must straightaway say that I have been very disappointed by the hon. Minister, but I do hope that ray dis-appointment will have some relief when he comes to replyâI listened very attentively when I was temporarily in the Chair	when was moving his Motion, just expecting to hearhim mention at least something about Yatta Settlement Schemes ,but I never heard anything about it. I want to say this: Ifthere is any place in this country where there is a problem,one of them is Yatta Settlement Scheme which is number one;I do not know whether he ignored it deliberately or whetherhe was misdirected by his officers to deliberately leave itout. I now want to expose the truth.Yatta Settlement Schemes were started way back in 1965under what was known as Haraka SettlementScheme initiated by His Excellency, the late President Kenyatta.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. MUTISO (CTD.): At that time, I was an Assistant Minister for education after I had fought for that land in Ndaiani to be taken over by the Government and given to squatters landless people. What has happened since 1965 to date is that the issue has gone from confusion to something else stronger than confusion chaos and a mess because the officers in the Ministry of Lands and Settlement I hate to mention individuals or even point a finger at a particular officer, but I am forced to say this in this case  have compounded this problem by issuing letters of allocation from offices here in Nairobi for plots in Yatta although they do not know where the plots are. how they are and who there is. This has continued for sometime nov A document was produced known as "a letter of allocation" in Haraka Settlement Scheme, and it carried some conditions namely, you were given a plot on condition that you moved in and settled there You had to fence it, develop it, cultivate it and develop a home there. This is because we were landless Failure to comply with these conditions would not be tolerated. You could not sub-divide that piece of that happened was that people got those letters of allocation in the early I96s, mid-1961s and towards the end of i96, but nobody moved in even to check where the plot Much later, in the 1979 s and early 198s, the Ministry issued other letters known as "outright purchase letters A person who did not know who was on the land for all these years got such a document and asked, "This plot is now mine because I have this letter simply because he paid Shs.1 per acre. That is no price of a piece of land. After that, you found that a person who had been on the land there for more than 15 or 2 years and had developed the land, built a home there, dug bench terraces, fenced the land, planted trees and developed the land by building schools, dispensaries, and so on participated in all development projects there was dislodged and another person comes with that letter of outright purchase with information from the court that the former owner of the land was being evicted because this land now belonged to another person who had that document. We have said in </newspeech><newspeech>MR. MUTISO (CTD.):our District Development Committee meetings and even told the ProvincialAdministration that this matter should he settled immediately because it isWith holding development in Yatta, particularly, in Ndalani Location andNdithini Location. I understand that a certain committee was set up composingpeople from the Ministry and others from the Provincial Administration,, Sincethe District Settlement Committee, which was being chaired by the DistrictCommissioner was removed there have been a lot of chaos there because these  people with outright purchase letters are coming and getting court eviction orders in order to try to evict the former owners of the land whereas these former owners have been on the land for more than 15 or 2 years. I request the Minister sincerely and very honestly to note that this is a very explosive matter and that if the Ministry does not move in quickly and settle the matter or devise a solution to it, there are going to be fights in that area. They have maintained that it is the Provincial Administration that should tell and explain to the Government the problem of land at the grassroots level because they are the people who represent the Government there and they know who has teen there and who is there now, what h that person has done and the right person to own that land, rather than the Commissioner of lands and  his officers here in Nairobi knowing that a certain plot is yours and nobody should deny you its ownership coming to chase you from the land after youhave devoted all your labours and "blood" on it. This is a. very seriousmatter, and that is why I said that I was very disappointed when I did notupon himhear the Minister mention anything aboutwhen he comes to reply, to tell the people of Yatta and the country at large the exact position of this matter, or else, there is going to be g trouble and it will be he and his officers who will be taken to be responsible for whathappens. He will not allow people who have not even contributed any penny to national development in that area to come and evict others who have lived there for over 15 years or even 2 years. These latter people have done everything there They were formerly landless now they are being told, "You only got.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. MUTISO (CTD.):that piece of land for speculation purposes." One might ask where they were living for all these year if they were genuine landless peopleHaving said that, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other thing I would like to mention is the question of title deeds in Yatta I am told that when the aircraft that does aerial photograph came there and took photographs in Yatta after land adjudication, those pictures were burnt. So, another exercise has to be undertaken in order to get these title deeds How come that this is possible? For how long are we going to wait for these title deeds? also want to develop and move forward like other areas in this country,. It is known that Yatta is a very dry area where we do not have any cash crops. The only thing that people there can rely on to get some loans for the development of their area is property If you cannot produce any document to prove that you have some security, then you are not worth anything in terms of bank loans. Therefore I urge the Minister to consider this issue more urgently and find out what happened to aerial photographs of Yatta that were taken, It is rumoured that those photographs were burnt, and that we have to wait for another chanceBecause I see that my time is running out very quickly, I want to say finally that the markets in Yatta and Ukairbani in general need to be attended to Physical planners must take quick action to ensure that they are physically planned so that we do not enter into a chaotic situation where shops and other buildings are constructed anyhow or in such a manner that it will not be possible to change there if need be in future.with these few remarks, Mr Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg tosupport.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. LDTITIYO: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir s for giving me this chance to contribute to this important Motion. One thing I want to say is that I congratulate the Minister for Lands and Settlementat least, for what he has done in the entire 332 Republic in trying to land laws and settle people all over the country. This is a very touchy and </newspeech><newspeech>MR. LOTITIYO (CTD.):delicate issue. Understanding our land problems and the issue of settling people, the Minister has really tried hard.</newspeech><newspeech>Mr. LOTITIYO (ctd.)Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have to praise theMinster, particularly, for the land adjudication which done inSauburu district and, especially Samburu west Constituency which Irepresent. The adjudication was done fairly and title deeds wore issuedHowever, I would 1ike to, also, say that there are some other partsin Samburu District which have not been adjudicated. An account should be taken of the normadic tribes in Samburu District, whom individuals might take advantage of to take their land after adjudication.I would also like to thank the Ministry for settling the Poroconflict amicably and directing that revision of adjudication be done,and I am glad to say that is being done, although I would also like tosay something about Baragoi Division, where adjudication has alreadybeen done, but there are a few individuals who have taken huge tractsof land Since, I think, title deeds have not been issued there, I wouldask the Ministry not to .issue them until there has been a re-adjudicationof land there. This is because as a result, very many individuals have.been loft landless, especially, the normads who are not aware of this,like those from Marti, Nachola and Kaua Locations. Some six or sevenpeople in that area have taken a lot of land and, as a result, have leftvery many of these  normads landless. It would be better if that wasadjudicated especially, Botu Location in Baragoi Division, otherwisewe might have a situation like the one we had in Poro area. I hope"the Minister will take note and effect precautions against this.Special consideration should be given to the nomards who move from oneplace to another which might result in some people thinking that thevacant land is unoccupied. Care must be taken when doing this. Thefixture of the people must be born in mine? to avoid, as much as possible offuture conflicts between people which might arise out such an issue.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. LOTITIYO (ctd.):The other thing, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, is as thatwe know that Samburu used to be a crown land, during the colonialdays. After attainment of  Independence it was converted to a Trust Land underthe Trust Land Ordinance. This needs reviewing too because whenland is entrusted to the President who in turn entrusts it to thecounty council in order to protect it for the people, not all countycouncils will have the interest of protecting the land for theindividuals concerned. For example the case I have of a placecalled in Samburu District which over 6. acres has been annexed by the county council, and has been issued to an individual to cultivate wheat. The people who were living there were told: "This land has been taken over by the county council. It now the county councils land". By doing this, I think, they are jeopardisÂ¬ing the trust which was entrusted to them by the President to protect the land for the people. I would like the minister to take note ofthat. It is unbecoming for the county council to annex trust landand theme give it to an individual to cultivate who at whereby therent for the land is remitted to the county council, and not to theresidents, who are the landowners and have shifted from there. Thisa serious issue which his there in Samburu District now. I trust the Minister who Is very able and I thank him for what he has done forthe people of Samburu District. when he was the Minister for Healthhe came there and gave materials which we have used to complete thecorridor and the store of the hospital. we also" now have a maternity ward.I hope so too that this issue of Pura area  spelled P U R A - will also be settled to prevent the county council from annexing it even though they are the ones Is entrusted to protect it for the people.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. LOTITIYO (Ctd.):Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, nobody is aware of this Even the Ministry of Local Government is not aware how the county council acquired this land. Our people should not be told out of the .blues that this land has been taken over bythe county council. Our people must be protected and they should not shifted fromthat, area,</newspeech><header>QUORUM</header><newspeech>MR. SEJIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is no quorum in the House.</newspeech><newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Karauri): Yes, there is no quorum. Will you ring the Division Bell?</newspeech>(The Division Bell was rung;)<newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Karauri): We have a quorum now. Will you continue, Mr. Lqtitiyo.</newspeech>(Mr. .Shikuku-.kept on standing)<newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Karauri): Order Mr. Shikuku I We have a quorum now. Will you continue, Mr. Lotitiyo.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. LOTITIYO: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. The other point which I would like to raise is with regard to the Land Control Board. In Samburuj we have a land control board which sits when the need arises, particuÂ¬larly when we have land cases, iand7-when there are other land transactions likeU.-, C  leasing of land and so on. However, our land control board is still being controlled ftyahururu	 "S-	,=from" J. .. which is very far from Samburu. I would like to appeal to the Ministerto ensure that this land conirol board is decentralized to the district level in lineUL C. with the district focus for rural development At the moment, we are still beingserved from Ifyahururu instead of Malalal. I am requesting the Minister to considerU-t, decentralizing this land control board so that all 1he necessary documents suchas title deeds for plots and other documents related to land transactions, can beissued in Malalal which is Hie district headquarters of Samburu District. I a hopethat the Minister has taken note of this point.At the same time, due to the long distance covered by the members of the land control board when they have to go to Kyahururu, I would like to them to be    paid travelling allowances. The members of our land control board have not been paid travelling allowances for the last two years. I hope the Minister will look into this problem so that the members of our land control board are paid their respective allowances whenever they meet.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR COMMERCE (Mr. Lalampaa): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,Sir. I would not like to interrupt my good friend, 	but I think he is misleading the House by saying that we have no land control board in Samburu. The fact is that we do have a land control board in Samburu.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. LOTITIYO: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to5challenge the hon. Member who has stood on that point of order, but I think heshould learn to listen so that he can understand me better. Maybe, he has a languageproblem. I did not say that there was no land control board in Samburu, but I said ofthe transactions of our land control board which are at the moment carried out at Nyahururu, should be carried out at Malalal which is the district headquarters.</newspeech>	<newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR COMERCE (Mr. Lalampaa): On a point of order,Sir. As far as I am concerned, I think the hon. Member stated quite categorically that wehave no land control Board in Samburu and that we are being controlled from Nyahururu.The fact is that we have a land control board in Samburu and the District CommissionerSamburu, is the Chairman of the Samburu Land Control Board and we have local people who are members of this land control board. What we have in Nyahururu and this is why I said that the hon.Member is misleading the House, is the land registry. What we have in Nyahururu is the land Registry and not the land control board. I think the records of this House must be put right.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. LOTITIYO: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have no quarrel with whatever the hon. Member is saying. I think what he is now saying is the best he can say and I have no quarrel with his sentiments. However, I hope that the Minister has taken note of  whatever I have said so that land transactions are done as near  home as possible.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I also mentioned the travelling allowances of the members of the land control board. I could not have mentioned travelling allowances of the members of the board if the board was not there. Therefore, I think the hon. Member should correct himself.</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. LOTITIYO (Ctd.):	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other point which I would like to make is about squatters. In settlement schemes in Nyahururu #1 Kolou, Kinangop, Laikipia and so on, we have a few Samburus who are squatters. When our people are being settled, particularly the squatters, I would like to request the Minister to consider all those people who have no land. I know that there are some Samburus who have been working in these settlement areas throughout their lives. So, when the time comes for taking over these areas for settlement, they are told to go back to their land. They are even told that they have a lot of land which is not adjudicated. So, they leave quietly because they do not know the importance of being settled theres and they go back when they are totally new people and want to resettle again and some times they find that their land has already been adjudicated and taken by other people. As a result, they have nowhere to go and they stay in towns. So, I would like to request the Minister to take care of our people, particularly, to those nomads whose understanding is very little so that they can be settled among others who have no land. I hope the Minister will do this. </newspeech>END S.<newspeech>MR. LOTITIY (ctd.):Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, finally, I would like to thank the Ministry of Lands and Settlement for the work it is doing. Land is a sensitive issue and it needs to be handled with care and proper attention. The way we plan is the.way Kenya will remain.With those few remarks, I beg to support.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. MUTHURA : Thank you very much Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me a chance to join my colleagues in contributing to this Motion.First, I would like to thank the Government for settling quite a big number of the people who were landless, either as a result of having been left in the Emergency villages in parts of Central and Eastern Provinces, or having been left by the former White settlers in the former White Highlands. The Government has done a good job.I would also like to thank the land-buying companies and co-operatives which have bought land and settled wananchi who could not be settled by the Government. It is not possible for the Government to settle everybody. So, these land-buying companies and co-operatives that have bought land and settled wananchi have done a comendable job.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, after the wananchi have been settled as has been aired in this House, they have problems. These have been solved partially by the Provincial Adminstration the  district commissioners, district officers and chiefs although still there are many problems existing which should be solved. In fact, in the course of solving these problems, which are on ownership and boundaries, you find that at times, more problems are created than solved. It has been said in this House that cases are still going to court. We are at a loss,</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. MUTHURA (ctd. ) :particularly the hon. Members, because we are the people who are supposed to tell the wananchi that the Government has decided that no more land cases should be taken to court. They still get confused when they hear of people going to court because there is a dispute over a certain piece of land. It is a known fact that when a case is taken court, and one of the parties involvedis a wealthy person who can hire a lawyer as qualified as Mr. Byron Georgiadis, the wealthy person will win the case against this old man who cannot afford to hire a lawyer, who does notunderstand law and who cannot argue. The Time has come when the Government, through the Ministry, should come up with a clear policy such that if there are cases to be taken to court, we should be told which cases they are. When I say this, I mean land cases. If land cases should not be taken to court, none of them should be taken there; otherwise, we tend to be hanging in the air because we still hear of cases going to court. This also should apply to those cases being determined by the Provincial Administration because when a district officer has a case, the decision is made by the court. So, we fail to understand what is going on. I hope the Minister will look into this veryseriously.	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other day, I put a Question to this House about the unregistered surveyors who have been surveying, sub-dividing and demarcating land, particularly the co-operative farms. The Minister replied.by saying that a list of registered surveyors has been sent to all the district commissioners. I hope the Provincial Administration is going to show a keen interest in this problem.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, mine is one of the constituencies in which land has been bought by co-operative societies and </newspeech><newspeech>MR. LUTHURA (ctd.):land-buying companies, and quite a number of these farms havebeen sub-divided and surveyed by people who have been chain-boysor chain-man for quite a number of years under a surveyor.This person then comes and tells the land-buying company or theco-operative society "oh, I can survey this land and sub-divide it foryou" without these people knowing that this person is not registeredto sub-divide and survey land. These people cannot get title deeds,and so hope that those pieces of land which have been sub-dividedby unregistered surveyors will be re-done by qualified surveyorsor Government surveyors, if possible.Land consolidation, as it was called in the past, started way back in 1957. If we have areas, as has been stated by hon. Members in this House, which have not been declared and adjudicated,where land has not been sub-divided, this shows that the Ministry is lacking qualified people, and I feel that it should have a crash programme. If we have crash programmes in the Ministry ofEducation and the Ministry of Health, why do we not have Them in the Ministry of lands and Settlement? In this way, we would have people trained and this would enable the quickening of this work since these people need title deeds.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Government started settling people in settlement schemes way back in 1962. Some of the people who were settled in those days have paid back the loans they were given they have fully paid the price of the land that they got. Up to now, despite the fact that they have no debt with the Government, they have not got the title deeds. Let them get them so that they can utilize them.We have a lot of idle land in this country. Those people who own this idle land are either absentee land-lords or the so called "telephone farmers" who do not make full use of the land. Time has come when a law should be brought into this House so that </newspeech> 	<newspeech>MR. MUTHURA(ctd.) :We can limit the amount of land that one should have so that wecan also make those people who leave some of the land thatthey own idle to make use of this land, If they cannot do so, itshould be taken away and be given to the landless.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, when we talked aboutEmergency villages in this House people living in villages insettled areas it sounds like a dream. Let those people who donot understand this go to some parts of the Rift Valley where theywill find these people. It is not possible for everyoneto own a piece of land in this country. However it is unfair tohave people without land and yet we have some people with so much land that unless one	checks back in the documents, he cannottell how many thousands of acres he owns. It is so much that theycannot make use of it. Let us be fair; those with idle land shouldeither give it away, or make use of it becuse we need a lot offood production in this country, I feel that there shouldbe a ceiling of the amount of land that an individual should ownin this country. I know when I say that, it touches some peoplebecause they own tracts and tracts of land on which you willonly find wild animals moving around. I feel that this isunfair.	I would now like to talk about the allocation of landin urban areas. I still remember a former engineer with Manyuki Town Council some time back who was complaining and trying to advise the council that there was no point of allocating somebody a plot in an area which had been declared a town or an urban area more than an acre on which to put up his house. Why do we see people being allocated with 1, 15 or 2 acres of land in urban areas? Why should this happen? I feel it is unfair because the population of this country is rising, we need more schools, more classes, more hospitals, more polytechnics and more factories together with </newspeech><newspeech>MR. MUTHURA (ctd.) :industries and, without land, we cannot have these. Therefore, the question of allocation of land in urban areas needs to be looked into so that an individual does not get 1, 2 or3 acres.   </newspeech> END T.ANO	U...1  28.1.87i<newspeech>MR. MUTHURA (ctd):Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the question of land should be taken seriously so that everybody in the country, at least those who should own land, can have a piece of land. From the sentiments expressed by hon. Members in this House, we can see the problems which are there and I hope that as the Minister touched on a few points here and there, he will implement what he has said, When he comes back to ask for more funds next year, we shall have seen the work that he has done and we shall be able to approve his Ministrys Budget.	With these few remarks, I beg to support. </newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY (Mr. Lugonzo): Thank you, Mr. Tenporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to say a few points on this very important Ministry, that is, the Ministry of Lands and Settlement. First all, I would like to say something about the physical planners. It is the Governments policy that town in the rural areas should be developed, more so, industrially. I think our physical planner have not yet known what the priorities are. In fact, every department should select priorities that are of importance to our national welfare. How is a town like Kakamega expected to develop industrially, if the physical planners; have not yet set aside an area for industry let alone surveying the plots for industry? You may have money and feasibility studies but unless you have the land on which to put up an industry, you will not be able to do so because land is the first essential thing.Yesterday, I was giving an answer here to a question which was asked to the effect that it is the Governments wish that industries should be established in the rural areas by indigenous people. This would be impoÂ¬ssible unless the physical planners realise that it is a priority. If the Governments wish of having industries in Wyori, Nanyuki, Kakamega, Kitui and and so is to be realised, the physical planners must know that it is a priority for them to plan our small towns. </newspeech><newspeech>TEE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY (Mr. Lugonzo) Ctd:	Those hon. Members who have been to places like America, will agree with me that these people build their cities about 2 years ago, like New York. These cities were well planned and you will find roads going parallel to one another. They planned because they know they were going to have big cities; they planned a long time ago. Why have Kenyan physical planners left a town like Kakamega to start developing and it not planned. If you go to Kakamega,where I come from, you find people mushÂ¬rooming houses everywhere. If they come to plan now, it will mean that road construction will pull down some of the houses which are now being consÂ¬tructed and it will be a big waste of capital, Why should people waste money to put up houses in towns in a haphazard manner when somebody will come later, call himself a planner and say: "Now I want to plan Kakamega." He will, probably need to break-down a lot of capital that has been established.Why are these people not seeing this and do their duty? It is their duty to plan the Kenyan towns, otherwise, I do not see what they earn for. It is not for this House to tell them what to do. Their directors and individual planners in the provinces should see this and make plans. This does not only apply to industry but also in housing. In a place like Kakamega town, housing is now at a crisis. For example, the small-scaleearners have no housing. If someone wants to put up a small estate of houses, it will take about three years before he is told where to build. Plot allocation is next to impossible.	Last year, there was an advertisement and thousands of people applied for plots both industrial, commercial and residential. They were surprised when all their money was refunded. There were 1, people and only a few lucky people, including myself, got plots. I was lucky to get only one plot. </newspeech><newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: HOW many did you want?</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR A INDUSTRY (Mr. Lugonzo): I was amongthe lucky group of less than 1 people. The ones who did not get anything are the ones I am crying for. Even mhe. Angatia did not get a plot.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY (Mr. Lugonso) :CTD: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this means that there arePeople especially those who work in this city and come from Kakamega District,who are ready to develop the district.They will develop the place even ifthey pat up residential houses; if they pat up industries, that is development;if they put up commercial buildings shops and so on that is development,That is what we want as they will provide employment to those who willcarry out construction works. Then thousands of people apply for for plots which they want to develop and only a few people are considered, why should we keep on crying about unemployment and so on when physical planners do not want to see these town developing at all.Through you, Sir, I would like to tell the Minister that he must do d something about the planning of towns said the allocation of plots. The allocation of plots should take the shortest time possible because the person who wants the plot, wants to develop it. I do not see why it should take more than two or three months Somebody who has money should be allowed to plough because that is development as people will get employment.The other thing is on the cost of land. It is becoming impossibleto buy land. In some areas, an acre of land is costing about Shs.1,=.I think there should be some control on the cost of land, especially in bigtowns, otherwise, development would be impossible. It is only a few very wealthypeople who will, be able to put up houses. If a small piece of land, say, in Nairobi where you have to put up a house, will cost you about Shs.5,=, then how many people can put up houses in Nairobi? Very few can afford Shs.5,= for a piece of land before they build. Why should this be alÂ¬lowed? Why should the land value be allowed to escalate to that height, thereby hampering development? If we want development, then some of these things should be looked into. The cost of land is just becoming impossible. It appears as if people have taken the word of architects and structural engineers to be like the Holy Bible. If an individual, say, myself is allowed to pat up a three bed-roomed house in Nairobi} it will not cost me more Shs.1,= when you look at the figure which is quoted by the so-called </newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY (Mr. Lugonzo) CTD:  exports, it will cost you She.3,=, Shs.4,= or even Shs.5, </newspeech> <newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY (Mr. Lugonzo)(Contd. ) :Sir, this must be checked and stopped. I say so because there are even houses in Kakamega which somebody worked out the prices, and then they were put up for people to buy. They say the houses were worth about KSh. 3..-. If I am given a plot close to that place and asked to put up exactly that kind of a house, it would cost KSh. 1,- or less; even KSh. 8,-. In accordance with the value of the materials and the cost of labour because the cost of labour in Kakamega is still very low and even the supervision, it would be cheap to put up a house. So, unless something is done to reduce the cost of building, then we are not going to develop. If everything is made expensive, people will fear to go in for it.Sir, I also want to join people who have said something about titledeeds. There is âForgeryâ I could call it "forgery" or a kind of "fraud". At present, there are people who sell land to an individual, and they very many in any constituency. After selling to somebody a piece of land, he goes to sell it to another person, and so on. Apparently,the law seems to protect these people. The law says that after three months, if you have-not transferred that land you have bought, this man has a right to change his mind and sell it to somebody else.I would like the Minister to take note of this and if possible, change that clause. I do not know whether it is Chapter 3. He should change that clause which says that after three months, unless you have transferred the piece of land, you cannot have it.Thank you, Sir. I beg to support.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. ANYUMBA: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker Sir, for giving me the opportunity so that I may also contribute to this Motion.This is one of the most important Ministries in the country, although a lot of people do not understand it. They talk, in terms of "land and land problems" not knowing that there is much more to it than </newspeech><newspeech>MR. ANYUMBA (Contd.):land. This Ministry is in charge of land, as everybody knows it. Land was a very thorny issue during colonial time, and it is still a very thorny issue indeed. Therefore, it is a very important Ministry.Sir, it is through the activities of this Ministry that an orderly identification of the pieces of land and an orderly identifiÂ¬cation of ownership is made. It is also through the activities of this Ministry that the sizes of these pieces of land are determined. It is also through this Ministry that the tenure of these pieces of land are recorded. All this is done through the process of land adjudication, and also survey and mapping for title purposes.Sir, perhaps not very many people do know that this Ministry is a service Ministry to very many other Ministries. In fact, certain Ministries cannot start embarking on their projects, whether Ministerial or Departmental under the Ministries before this Ministry does some service to them through their Department of Survey. Actually, every Ministry requires the services of this Ministry. For instance, before the Ministry of Agriculture can embark on implementing some of their agricultural projects, they require basic maps supplied by this Ministry. Also, the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, quite often, they call upon the services of this Ministry to enable them to start their own projects. For instance, the Ministries of Tourism and Wildlife, Education and name it, require the services of this Ministry. So, it is an extremely important Ministry. Sir, this is also a Ministry that has to invest heavily on manpower, equipment, stores and so on. These stores and equipment are now extremely expensive. For instance, a darubini which used to cost about KSh.68,- in 198 is now costing KSh. 214,-! This is the same intrument, and it is only one, and they need very.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. ANYUMBA (Contd.):many of them. That is only a darubini. So, if you take into account what they have to invest in the mapping equipment and so on, it is extremely very expensive, That is why I feel very strongly that we in this House must recommend that better funding be afforded to this Ministry. I read from the Budgetary supplies and see that what they are given is so minimal. It even gives the impression that the Government is determined to have no more survey done, or no expansion whatsoever, If there were to be more expansion which must be there because we are a dynamic country and we are expanding; we are not diminishing in size and, therefore, with expansion, there will be surveying and mapping. There will be level education. There will also be more and more projects coming into play for which we must apply the basic maps.Sir, I know very well from my own experience that from the Department and also from the Ministry, they require the amount of money which would see them through to the next financial year. But it is heavily cut down when matters reach the Treasury. I know that a Ministry cannot be made an exception. But nevertheless, the services of a Ministry should be understood because by "choking" it, we are also choking several other Departments and Ministries. We must plead for this, and I am glad that a number of people have been pleading that they should "pump" more and more money to this Ministry.Sir, when it comes to planning and surveying of townships, I know a lot of them have been "chocked" as a result of lack of funding. Today, we have urban centres, townships, and even trading centres which have expanded but in a haphazard manner. The buildings have mushroomed, and certainly leading to slums. Again, I am aware that a lot of it has to do with lack of funding for planning, surveying and mapping purposes. I have been trying to get trading centres in my constituency planned. After planning two of them, it was impossible.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. AMYUMCA (Contd.):to go to the third and fourth due to lack of funding. Yet these are trading centres with the size of urban centres, and which should be promoted to urban centres. I am sure their early and orderly development is vital if we are going to avoid future confusion.Here, the Director of Survey and the Ministry of Works, Housing and Physical Planning, have to work very closely. That is why I find it difficult right now to understand why the Department of Physical Planning was removed from this Ministry because they work very closely At least, during my time, we used to work very closely </newspeech><newspeech>MR. ANYUMBA (ctd. ):At least during time, it was rather shameful to have a telephone between us;we had to make telephone calls before we could communicate. This is wherewalking across and discussing a subject is much wiser than being put in a completelydifferent Ministry. As you know, each Ministry has its own bureaucratic tendenciesand, perhaps, these bureaucracies are not working well in the light of the closeassociation needed.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, hon. Members in this House seem to beMaking wild accusations with regard to survey fees chargeable by licensed surveyors.I would like to remind the House that the Surveys Act, Cap 299 of the laws ofKenya was passed in this House. That Act provides for the statutory charges approvedby this House as fair charges signed by the President at that time. I have listenedto people contributing to this Motion, and I have noticed that they are talking wildas if they were not contributors to the debate that passed the Bill which becamethe Surveys Act. Survey is not a cheap sort of exercise to undertake. Thereforeif you are paying what this House passed and became an Act of Parliament, we should be the last fellows to start talking against what we passed. Indeed, I can give you an example of an hon. Minister in this House who did not distinguish between a qualified surveyor and a bogus surveyor. The bogus surveyor charged him KShs.64, to execute survey on his farm in Rift Valley Province. On presentation of the survey, the Director of Survey would not want to see it because it had been done by an unqualified man. Although he did the planning and all other sorts of things, he was not a qualified planner and, therefore, the Government would not want to accept his piece of work. Since the Minister had paid KShs.64,- and the Government had rejected the work, he came to me and asked for assistance since, as a fellow politician, we flock together. That is how I can able to understand his predicament. After I told him what to do, he went to a private surveyor who charged him only KShs.42,- for doing the job all over again.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, that is a case where a bogus surveyorwhose job is not recognised charged KShs.64,- and where a qualified surveyor who is recognised by the Government charged only KShs.42, according to the </newspeech><newspeech>MR. ANYUMBA (ctd.):scale of charges passed by this House. So, we seem to be quite ignorant when it comes to the application of the very Act we passed. I would like this to take advantage of drawing the Houses attention to the Survey Act, Cap. 299 of the laws of Kenya, You will find that everything is extremely detailed as to what we charge for. Do we charge for clearing of bush? Do we charge for too much open land? We charge for different types of service. If we did that, we would be less vocal against the present survey fees which are very moderate. In fact, those fees were revised way back in 1978, and at this time many things have changed.With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg tosupport the Motion.</newspeech><newspeech>THE MINISTER FOE ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES (Mr. Nyagah): Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to also air my views on this very important Ministry. As the previous speaker has said, it is a Ministry of life and death to many of us in this country.Sir, land became the cardinal point when Uhuru was being fought for. At about the time when this question of land ownership was being considered by this hon. House and its predecessor, we had three types of land operations in mind. We had land consolidation, land adjudication and land settlement. For land settlement, it is reasonably easy because surveyors and the people in the Ministry simply divided the land parcels according to the number of people they wanted to settle and that was all. Land consolidation, was more difficult because we had to consolidate many pieces of land which were scattered here and there, thereby disturbing quite a lot of people in the vicinity in question. That exercise was mainly in the Central Province and it was done and more or less completed. We were then left with a relatively easier programme of land adjudication which, to me, has been assuming proportions that it should not have assumed by now. For instance, in my area where I thought the work was going to be very smooth and be finished with very quickly, land adjudication has taken a long time. I think there is an unnecessary protracting of work by the people who are doing the job. I would,</newspeech><newspeech>THE MIHISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES (ctd. ):therefore like to appeal to the Minister to ensure that this work which was	started about 15 years ago is completed. As a result of this protraction, land cases are springing up every now and then and are causing unknown transactional behaviour in the operation of land adjudication.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other point I think should beclarified is what The Standard newspaper tried to serialise sometimes back, andthat is the classification of land in this country. That is very important. We have the state land, trust land and freehold land. Maybe, it would be easier to understand what a free hold land means because a person has a title deed. Maybe, too, it is easier for one to know what a state land is. Trust lands are open to abuse, especially by local authorities. They have arbitrarily interfered with parcels of land that have been left within the jurisdiction of local authorities for social and community services. Local authorities seem to think that they can just take a parcel of land and allocate it to friends or use them for services that are not necessarily communal. I think the authorities in this Ministry should ensure that the abuse by local authorities on this matter is put to an end. SomeÂ¬times trust land comprises of a big portion of a district, just because it is neither freehold land nor state land. Again, local authorities seem to think that they can do whatever they like with trust land.I have in mind, Sir, the areas around the big hydroelectric dams along River Tana. The land there is trust land under Machekos, Kitui and Enbu districts. If, for development purposes, a sufficient piece of land is taken from the trust land, and it is found that the land that has been taken is too big for the purposes of, for example, constructing an hydroelectric dam, the rest should be reverted to the trust land for the people in the vicinity to be settled. That land should not be given to individuals. I have a case of 17 parcels of land. In fact, I find it difficult to reconcile the people I represent, who have been given 1 acres each in  Mwea Settlement Scheme.Around the corner there, a few people have been given over 5 acres each on a land that should .</newspeech><newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES (ctd.):  have been returned to Soibu County Council as trust land.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, group ranches might have been useful when we wanted to have some kind of identification as to who owes what and for what purpose. In the place where I come from we do not have ranches but, for the purpose of land adjudication, groups of people came together and, for instance you could have five people written down together as the trustees of a certain group. Those so-called trustees have turned some of those group ranches into their own land. They negotiate and sell, forgetting that they are trustees of a group of people. So many times in our district development committee we have said that these groups are no longer necessary in our area and we have suggested that they should be parcelled up like everywhere else and individual land title deeds be given. I hope that the hon. Minister for Lands and Settlement will look into this matter and let us have the right of sub-dividing these ranches among the people for whom the five trustees stood for,</newspeech><newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES(ctd);Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other problemthat we face in Embu District is about land registration officersand estate agency officers,I think something should be done to identify who is bogus and who is not bogus.Some of the estate agency officers are swindling  a lot. It has been alleged that they work in league with some of the very junior officers in the lands office thereby taking land away from people and making them landless. It is possible to come across a landless person who had land before; it has either been sold or transferred. I would like the Minister to look into this matter and ensure that land offices are nothing but the places where a person gets satisfaction and protection for his land.Finally, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker Sir physical planning of urban areas should be stepped up. Like the hon.Member who spoke before me said, we need to have physical planning done in a towns, markets and in the villages so that we can develop villages, townships in an orderly manner and for the right developmental classifications. If a piece of land has been set aside as a play ground or for building schools and hospitals, churches, or national parks, it should be respected as such. Those concerned should indicate where roads will pass so that people do not put up buildings in haphazard manner.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, arty development in land matters especially in local authorities should he in consonant with the development of the district. The district development committee should be involved in determining the future of any of the trust land; whether it is a kiosk or a shopping centre.</newspeech><newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES(ctd) ;Incidentally these kiosks that we have, good as theyare the Jua Kali has been of great relief to mwananchi shouldbe controlled. I think they are untidy and especially when they arebadly sited in the middle of a planned, market. They are a sourceof irritation in some places.With these few remarks, I beg to supports.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. ONIDO: Thank you very much, Mr.Temporary DeputySpeaker, Sir.I would first like to pay a special tribute to HisExcellency the President for the manner in which he has settledwhat would have been a catastrophe in land matters in this countryEverybody in this House knows that land buying companies andorganisations bought land and in the end it was only the leaderswho benefited from those lands. It was due to HisExcellency the Presidents foresight that a very dangeroussituation was averted. So, for this reason I would like to payspecial tribute to His Excellency the President,Another thing that I would like to mention is the questionof squatters1 When we n talk about squatters one only needs todrive from Nairobi to Kitale. As you drive along the road you will see small huts on the roadside. Those huts belong to squatters; people who used to live on former Europeans lands and who, having been thrown out of those lands, have nowhere else to go. When we talk about this problem it appears as if we are walking on slippery s grounds But one of my colleagues, while contributingto this Motion, said that the time has come when we should considerseriously the question of acres of land an individual in this country should be allowed to possess. I think this is important. It is important because if we do not do this, the squatter Population will keep on Increasing.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. ONIDO (CTD.):The time has come when the situation could explode. I believe that the Ministry should seriously take this problem into consideration and see to it that those people are settledAnother problem, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, arises when it comes to the allocation of commercial and industrial plots or even residential plots in urban areas. The time has come when we should no longer allocate plots to Asians in our urban areas. Any plots for development should be allocated to indigenous Kenyans of African origin because this country belongs to them. The Asian has no loyalty at all whatever we do because the Asians in Kenya just want to rob us and take the loot to Britain, They are in Tanzania to rob Tanzanians and take the loot to New Zealand. Those in New Zealand will rob New Zealanders and take the loot to Britain, and so on. We cannot continue to nurse Asians because no matter what amount of nursing we do, they are not loyal to this country. We should no longer allocate our commercial and industrial plots to the Asian people. In allocating these plots, I strongly feel that a committee should be established from all the provinces of Kenya. I am saying this because the people of this country, as a whole, have a right to share the fruits of economic development in this country. In order to ensure that people from all parts of Kenya have a share in the commercial and industrial sectors of this country, it is only fair that we make sure that they are also given consideration in the allocation of plots when we have them. </newspeech><newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: They are giving you Harambee donations.</newspeech>	<newspeech>MR. OMIDO: This is what I have in mind. If we do not do so, e we will be running a risk where one section of the population of Kenya will dominate all kg the industries and commercial interests, and this will provide a threat to our very stability which everybody in this country is struggling to build.	It was not long ago when His Excellency the President was addressing a Harambee meeting at the Church of God in Jericho. He directed that the plot next to the church be given to the church immediately. He even told the church .</newspeech><newspeech>MR. CKIDO (CTD.):to get ready to fence off the plot. I now understand that arrangements arebeing made to allocate that same plot for other interests. This is a dangerous situation.In respect of the same Buru Buru area, I have said in this House time and again that the area is inhabited mainly by the young generation which has no social facilities. All we have had are promises that the situation is being considered and arrangements being made in this regard, We have no social facilities in that area in the form of social halls, play fields or even libraries o This is a serious matter, which I keep on repeating, I want to repeat again that it is time the Ministry took immediate and urgent measures to provide land for these facilities in that area.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. OHIDO (Ctd. ): Mr.Temporary Deputy Speaker, Six, there is a school along Rabai Road and adjacent to it, there is a piece of land. It was agreed years ago, that that piece of land should be allocated to that school. However, somebody else is using this piece of land for other purposes and we do not know why this is being done. In fact, I understand that at this piece of land has been sold. If we can take pieces of land allocated for our public use because of greed or personal interests and non-commitment to the development our people, then this is a very sun dangerous situation. We are loading the President with a lot of work because he must come up and say, "This should not be done". Even what the President says should be done is not done because our people are greedy and hungry. This is a serious situation and I think the Ministry should take serious consideration of this problem.With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, I beg to support.</newspeech><newspeech> MR. SHIKUKU: Ahsante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika wa Muda. Ningependa kunrwunga mkono, mhe. Mbunge ambaye amemalisa ho tuba yake hivi sasa na kunweleza kwaniba mambo haya yote yanatokea kwa sababu watu wengi wamesema. katika Bungehili na katika mikutano ya Harambe,"Hatutaki maneno, tunataka vitenda".Lakini, ukitaka kufanyavitendo, ni lazima uwe na pesa,na ukitaka pesa ya kutenda, ni lazima ujiuzewewe mwenyewe. Hata ploti arabazo zimetengwa kwa viwanja vya kuchezewa na watoto wa shule, Vinauzwa ili watu wapate pesa za kutoa katika mikutano ya Harambee. Hii ndiyo  sababu wanasema, "Hatutaki maneno, tunataka vitendo" au "Mimi na bibiyangu tumetoa elfu kadhaa za shilingi. Huu ndio ugonjwa na hatuwesi kusemamambo mengine na kuacha kusema ukweli. Ukweli ni kwamba uongozi wa Kenyaunanunuliwa. Usipotoa pesa za harambee, wewe si kiongozi na ha ta ikiwezekana,unaweza kupelekwa katika disciplinary committee ya Kanu. Mungu asifiwe hiyokamati imefutiliwa mbali </newspeech><newspeech>MR. MUTHURU: Imevunjwa! </newspeech><newspeech>MR. SH1KUKU: Imevunjwa. Mungu si z Abdullah. Nasema hivyo kwa sababuwao wanasema kwamba ikiwa hutoi pesa za Harambee, una makosu. Kwa hivyo,watu wamejaribu kwa. vyovyote hata kwa kuiuza nchi yao ili wapate pesa za Harambeeili wawe viongozi katika Bunco hili.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU (Cotd.):Hivyo ni kuununua uongozi wa nchi. Popularity today, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, is for purchase. Hivyo ni kusema kwamba uongozi unanunuliwa. Unaweza kuwa kiongozi, si kwa sababu ya akili uliyonayo, lakini kwu ajili ya pesa ulizo_naza.Hii ndiyo sababu wanasema, "Hatutaki maneno, tunataka vitendo". Lakini vitendo hivi vinaleta wizi na uuzaji wa nchi hii.Jambo la piii ni kwambaharti sa kumiliki ardhi zimeleta taabu sana.Ukweli ni kwamba - na ni lazima Waziri afahamu jambo hili - wananchi wadogowananyanganywa ardhi yao na watu wakubwa na hii ardhi wamekuwa nayo tangu zamaniza kale. Jambo hili linafanyika kwa sababu ya ufisadi katika ofisi ya land registry.Mwananchi anaweza Kufikiria kwamba ana ardhi, kumbe Bw. Shikuku, amezunguka zungukahuka na, kule na kupata harti ya kumiliki ardhi hii. Sasa jambo yule mwananchiatakaloliona ni kwamba atamkuta Bw. Shikuku akizungusha ile ardhi na ua lasengenge kwa sababu amepata harti ya kuimiliki. Mimi ninazo kesi zaidi ya 2za aina hii na ikiwa waziri anataka ninaweza kumwonyesha kesi hizo.Sasa yule mwananchi anapoamka asubuhi, anamkimbilia mhe. Shikuku nakusema, "Nimeambiwa nitoke kwa shambe langu na baba yangu". Ufisadi huu uko mwingi sana katikamaofisi ya ardhi kote nchini. Wananchi wadogo wanalia. Watu wadogo katika nchi hii hawana halci kwa sababu wanonyang anywa mali yao na watu wakubwa na haya ndiyo mambo arabayo yamerdfanya nije nisema katika Bunge hili ili wasikie na wasiposikia, ni shauri yao. Kawaida ya watu hawa ni kukataa kuyasikia maneno Bw. Shikuku anayosema lakini baadaye wanayarudia yale maneno na knjifanya kwamba wao wanayaseraa kwa mara ya kwanza. Lakini wananchi si wapumbavu. Wananchi hawa hawakuscma na kwa hivyo hawana digrii, lakini wana akili na hili ndilo jambo ambalo litawashtua wakubwa siku nyingine kwa sababu wananchi wadogo wamecheshea un wakubwa. Huja vita itatokea katika siku zuazo baina ya wakubwa ambao wana shirikiana na Wahindi ili kuwanyanyasa watu wadogo, na hawa watu wadogo. Hii itakuwavita kali sana. Wananchi wengi ni wadogo na vita vitakuwa kamaVilcoya FrenchRevolution. Mimi ninayescma juu ya mambo ambayo yatakutya	mwishowe.Jambo la pili ni kwamba tulipitisha shsria hapa Bungeni kwamba watuwanakaokuwa wakiangalia mambo ya mashaoba wawe waicuu wa tarafa. Ukweli ni kwamba wakuu wa tarafa hawafanyi kazi zao na sasa wamewaachia machifu na wasaidizi wao .</newspeech><newspeech>MS. SEIKUKU (Ctd. )	ambao vanawanyang anya Wananchi nashamba. Sasa mtu ndogo hana haki hata kidogo. NI  kwa nini jambo hili linafanyika na sisi tuliipitisha siieria hapa Siigna Bungeni Hi kwa nini sheria hii haifanyi kazi? Jambo hili linafanyika kwa sababu mtuha re si kir.m mtu katjka Kenya ikiwa hana pesa. Ni lazima upate pesa. Vlaf anyakazi wa Serikali wanaiaka pesa, wanasiasa pia wanataka pesa na mwanasiasa ndiye anaumia aidi kua sababu anakinfoia huku na kule. Ilata mwanasiasa K anampigia mfanyakazi wa Serikali saluti siku hizi, fea sababu hana heshima ten a na amekuwa mwombaji.Jambo lingine linahusu a ugawaji va ardhi. Ec Ijapokuwa tungetakakumpatia kila mtu sehemu lei do go ya ardhi, jarabo hili haliviesekaiii. ITi lasimatusema ukweli katika nchi hii, si ka sababu si kila mtu. atakayepata ardhi.

Kwa rr.fano, lratika upande wa  West Pokot, tunahudumiva 11a land registry ya Eldorct ambayo in pia inahudumia  wila.ya nyingi, kama vile, Uasin  Gishu, Trans Nsoia and Turkana.

Inaloiwa shida sana kwa mwananchi wa kawaida kusafiri kutoka wilaya hi si hadi Eldorct Icra nia ya kuhudurniwa na hiyo land registry.ningepenia kuiulisa hii Wisara ifikirie sana ns, ikiwesekana, wagagwe wilaya hizi na waongeze land registry moja. Ingefaa land registry moja iwekwe katika wilaya ya West pokot anbayo itawahudumia watu wa Wilaya ya West Pokot and watu wa wilaya ya Turkana ili ile land registry yaEldoret, iwahudumi s watu wa wilaya sa Uasin Gishu, Elgoyo Marakwet na kadhalika.Jarabo lingine ambalo ningspenda kuseoma linahusu group ranching. Siku hi si, watu wameacha ule mtindo wa group ranching na wanataka waga- gwiwe mashasba ili wawese kuyastawisha vale wanavyotaka. Sisi watu wa wilaya ya west Pokot, tuna lokesheni kadhaa na watu wa sehemu hizo wameacha mambo ya group ranching na mashamba yanegagwa  kwa watu binafsi. Mashamba yamegagwa kwa mfano, katika sehenra ya Kornelai, Nariwra na kadhalika. Wanakaraati wamegagwa mashasba na sasa kila mtu ana sehema yake. Kitu ambacho ningeiomba wizara ni kwamba ingefaa iwaturse watu wa land adjudication waingie katika sehemu hiyo na waanze kuwagagwia watu mashamba ili kila matu awe na sehemu yake. Group ranching ilikuwa ikiendelea hapo zamani  lakini sasa watu wanataka kukaa pahali pamoja na kuendelea na kasi zao. Kwa kweli jarabo hili litakomesha uizi wa mifugo kwa vile watu hawatakuwa wakiharna ovyo ovyo. Sisi wengin ambao tunaishi mpkani mwa Kenya na Uganda, itakuwa vizuri kila mtu akiwa na sehesu yake ya shamba na itakuwarahisi kawa maofisa wa. utawala kujua ni ntu gani mgeni anbaye ametoka nchi jirani Iruingia hapa Kenya. Ningependa kuiulisa wisara hii ifikirie sana kuwapcleka maofisa wake huko ili watu waweze kuwa na mashamba yao binafsi. Kwa njia hii, watawcza kustawisha mashaiaba yao na kufanya kazi ambayo inaweza kuisadia nchi hii.Ningopenda kasema machache kuhusu wanakamati wa mashamba. Tuna wazee wa kamati sa mashamba wanaofanya kazi nyingi kutoka asubuhi hadi jioni lakini marupurupu wanayopowa ni ya kiasi cha. chini sana. Pesa hizi hazilinganiki na bali ya maisha ya sasa.

Pesa hizi ni kidogo sana na hali watu hawa husafiri sana hasa wale wanaohusika na kezi sa mashamba na inawabidi kwenda katika makao makuu ya wilaya. watu huzunguka sana na hufanya kazi nzuri sana. Ningependa kumuuliza waziri aangalie jambo hili na afanye mpango wa kurekebisha kiasi cha marapurupu. ya wanakamati ili wawese kupata kitu ambacho kitaweza kuwasaidia.Ningcpenda kusema machache kuhusu land survey. Katika miji yetu,kama vile, Kapenguria Trading Centre, anbayo sasa tunafurahi imefanywa kuywaurban council, ningependa masorovea waingie huko na kuendelea kupima nashamba. Hatujui ni kitu gani kilichozimamisha kasi hii kwa sababu ilikuwa ikiendelea hapo mbeleni. Tungependa tuwe na vyeti vya kumiliki mashamba katika townships au urban councils ili watu wawese kuwa na uwezo wa kuomba mikopo. Kuna mashirika mengineya Serikali yanayosaidia sana katika mambo ya maondeleo wilayani. Tumefanikiwa kwa vile sasa tuna benki na kadhalika lakini kama hatuna vyoti vya kumiliki mashamba, inakuwe shida kupata mkopo iukutoka benki. Ingefaa wisara iangalie na kuona kwaba imewatuna mashamba huko au watafute njia ya kutafuta pssa ili naofisa hawa waweze kuingia katika. kila township ili watu waweze kupata vyeti vya kumiliki mashamba. Ingefaa pia vyeti hivi vya kumiliki mashamba vitolewe kwa wakati unaofaa.Jambo la mwisho linawahusu wale watu ambao hawana mashambu. Nhe Mbunge mmoja alisoma hapa kwamba ukitembea barabarani, utaona kwamba kuna watu wanaoishi karibu na barabara, hasa kati ya Kitale na Kapanguria. Kuna watu ambao wanejenga nyumba karibu na barabara na hayo ndio maboma yao kwavile hawana pahali pengine. Ingefaa wizara ifikirie na ngalia juu ya shida ya hawa viatu ili watafutiwe pahali pa kuishi kama WA wanakenya wongins. Ingefaa, watu hawa waangaliwe ikiwa kuna shamba ambalo linafikiriwa kugagwa ili wasipate shida ya kuishi kando ya barabara. Jambo hili litaweza kuzuia ajali za barabarani kwa vile watoto watawoza kukimbia barabaraninovyo. Kva hayo machache, ninaunga mkono.</newspeech>	<newspeech>MR. MUNYAO: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,Sir, for giving me this chance to say a few words on this Vote.First of all, allow me to congratulate the Minister personallyand also his senior officers who are here. Apart from moving hisVote very successfully, he has sat all along and listened to everyon. Member who spoke this afternoon. This is a credit and we give toit to the particular Minister. Maybe he is used to it because earlier on, being a financial man, he used to listen to all kinds of borrower and stories. I congratulate him for that.Sir, having said that, allow me also to support the words of wisdom which were said by hon. Oraido and also Hon. Shikuku in so far as the question of allocation of land to foreigners is concerned. Sir, 24 years is not a short time. It is high time we in Kenya had rules and laws to match other international laws of either countries. We must have the law of reciprocity. What applies in other countries must also apply here. It is not easy for an individual from Kenya to travel to, say, India, Bombay, New Delhi, London, New York, and so on, and apply for industrial or commercial land, or even residential land and get it. In fact, foreign embassies need some land to put up their own offices. How come that everybody, every "Shah" and "Patel" who comes here can apply for land and get it todav? I would urge the Minister for Lands and Settlement to bring a bill which will totally block any allocation of land to foreigners except those who are in joint ventures with Government. In this way, joint ventures will be encouraged because Kenya is a lucrative country. It is also a beautiful country for investment. I am sure that we are going to win those clever people with finances. That is the only we can win joint ventures. So, I would request the Minister to bring in an amendment right now to the Bill so that this anomally can be corrected.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. MU2JYA (Contc!.):Sir, the other issue that is connected to that is that we have so many land lows which work against each other. It is high time the Minister and his senior staff went through all of them, at least, to regularise them so that we have "manageable" laws. We have so many land laws which are not manageable. For instance, Muthaiga has a different land law from Lavington, Karen, Machakos, and so on. Even Eastleigh has a different land law, or even here where we are, v.e havea different law. When are we going to regularise our land laws? We are 24 years since Independence, and it is high time we normalised our land laws. We should make it easy for the laws of our country to operate. Even lawyers, sometimes, they swindle people because we have a million and one land laws! Why can we, as a Ministry, not go through our land laws, regularise them and normalise them so that we have as few land laws as possible and which are manageable? This is an appeal and a challenge to the Minister so that he can do something about it.Sir, there is another issue which is lamentable, and I wouldlike the Minister, when he comes to reply, to take time and tell ussomething about it. We have a lady in Wamunyu Location called "MuneeMaitha, Identity Card No.352673466". This lady has a title number.The number is: "WamunyuKwa Kalal8". The land has been subdividedinto three areas and have the titles. However, what has happened is so bad that one is bound to cry when he thinks about it.</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. KUHYAO(ctd.): The fact of the matter is that this piece of land is owned by a family of six people. But one person from that family has connived and sold the land  No. Wamunyu kwa Kala 18 - to a rich conman who is very influential. By doing so, he has deprived these other five people access to their piece of land. I have the documents with me here and I will give them to the Minister later on since I intend to follow the matter up further. This lady has gone with her family and they have filled in this declaration form. In fact, the form was filled in on 9th March, 1987, blocking the sale of this land. They have written several letters against the sale of the piece of land but nothing seems to be happening in their favour. The letter they wrote on 15th June, 1987, was copied to the officer in charge of survey in the area and everybody else who matters including the Minister for Lands and Settlement and in that letter, they objected to the change of the title deed. They wrote another letter on 19th March, 1987, another one on 24th March, 1987 and another one on 26th March, 1987. All these I am holding are forms which have been filled in objecting to this unfair deal. If it is allowed that this parcel of land be sold to this conman against the wish of these five people, then it will deprive their dependants of their livelihood.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, His Excellency the President said that all land cases would be referred to village elders for the purpose of ensuring that fair deals are carried out. The administration has tried all what it can do, and now we want the local leaders, the clan and everybody else in the area to be involved to make sure that pa proper administration of this land will be done. He want each member of that family to get his right share. This lady is very elderly and she cannot talk to this conman who has a lot of money n and power. She hastried to go to various places but ii the conman has blocked every way. As I talkhere now, we understand that the Machakos Land Control Board might have given another title deed for the piece of land. What an abuse of the law why should we allow something like this to happen. I appeal the Minister to look at these forms I am holding and the land title deed because, as a banker,<newspeech>MS. KUrTYAO (ctd. ):is used to looking at different title deeds and knowing the owners. We want this land transaction to be stopped completely until we get the proper word from the clan members arid the leaders of that place. If they say that the piece of land canbe sold by one person, fair enough. What we want is a fair deal.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, a lot has been said on land tricksters but I went to emphasise on only one thing. There are some very clever people who sell one piece of land to several people so that they bring a lot of confusion between the buyers. We want the Minister to stand firm and say that once a piece of land has been sold, there should be no more appeals provided that the piece of-land is sold in the right way. If a piece of land is sold in the right manner, there should be no appeal from anybody.The other thing I want to point out is that the Minister for Lands andSettlement has denied the people of Mbooni development for a long time. There are some areas such as Kibauni, Kalawa, Kisau, Kiteta and Mbooni which were declared adjudication areas way back in 1974 but, up to row, title deeds have not been issued. That is great unfairness because these people who live in these dry areas should also survive. <newspeech>MR. MUIYAO (ctd.) :If these people can be given their title deeds, at least they can develop further. Today, no one can do anything. We appeal to the Minister to reduce the title deeds which are ready.Every time we ask for these title deeds, We are told that the maps are in Ruarakalin or in the Lands Office. When we go there, we find that the files are full of dust, because nobody looks at some of those files. I congratulate the adjudication office at Marshalls House. I have not been there, but my people tell me that it is faster. The Minister must examine the delay which is at Ruaraka and tell us what is causing it. We hear that the delay is due to aerial maps.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, physical planning is another problem. I am sorry it is not in this Ministry, but we must talk about it now because the Minister for Lands and Settlement is in charge of land policy. We are told that some of the land in machakos Which has been recommended for surveying cannot be surveyed due to lack of manpower and also equipment istoo old. Another hindrance is lack oftransport.since these )officers cannot travel to the recommended areas without means of transport. For how long will this continue.with those few remarks, I support.</newspeech><newspeech>Mr. arap KOSKE: Thank you Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker,Sir for giving me an s opportunity to make a few points pertaining to this very important Motion.	One thing I would like to find out is how processing of sub-division is done. During the sub-division of farms, particularly in Kericho District, there were a lot of mistakes which were found out after the surveyors had left. These mistakes are still there awaiting correction and as much, I would like to urge the Ministry to see to it that these mistakes are  corrected as </newspeech><newspeech>MR. arap KQSICE (ctd.)quickly as possible. This because once somebody is informed that the sub-division was done incorrectly he is not going to be keen enough to develop that farm as he is never sure whether he will be moved from that piece of land, and leave it together with the development upon it to somebody else.Much has been said about unqualified surveyors. These people have done a lot of bad work in Kericho East Constituency to the effect that most of the farmers have been forced to pay more money for Government surveyors to come and do the job all over again. I would like to suggest to the Ministry of Lands and Settlement to ensure that unqualified surveyors are not allowed to survey land since they are aggravating the problems which are already there. Some of these surveyors ran away with wananchi s money. It is therefore the duty of the Government to ensure that surveyors do not demand to be paid before they finish the work. These surveyors should be paid through the GovernÂ¬ment machinery so that they do not have a way of running away with wananchis money before they do the work. We now have a problem of following them </newspeech><header>ADJOURNMENT</header><newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Karauri): Hon Members, it is now time for the interruption of business.

MUTEURA asked the Minister for Livestock Development doing to alleviate the problem of transport for artificial insemination services personnel in Laikipia District.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER LIVS-STOCK DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Qyondi):Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.The problem of transport for artificial insemination services inLaikipia District and other districts in the country, during the current 198788Financial Year is as a result of inadequate allocation of funds. The Ministry </newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT (Mr. Oyondi)(Ctd.): is in the process of re-allocating both funds and vehicles from other services like general disease control to artificial insemination services. The plan of operation between the Kenya Government and the United Nations Development Programme Food and Agriculture Organisation World Food Programme has allocated Shs.1 million for the development of artificial insemination services in the country. Of this money expected to be realised within the next 14 days, Laikipia will be allocated Shs.ll6,= for transport and travelling expenses,</newspeech><newspeech>MR. MUTHURA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the calculation was done where Laikipia was allocated Shs.ll6,= for how long was it thought that this money was going to last?</newspeech><newspeech>MR. OYOEDI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the money allocated to Laikipia is spent, the Ministry will be there to consider the area for another allocation,</newspeech><newspeech>MR. KINYANJUI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, arising from the answer given by the Assistant Minister in which he says that when the allocated money is exhausted the Ministry will consider allocating more money to Laikipia, but we know that cattle should be given artificial insemination at certain times. What will farmers be doing during the time they are waiting for further allocation of money?</newspeech><newspeech>Mr. YNDI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the measures I have mentioned above are short-term solutions. But in the long run, the Ministry, in consultation with the Treasury, will make sufficient financial provision for the transport of artificial insemination services personnel.An agreement with the Swedish International Development Agency is nearing completion, and this Agency will grant Kenya Â£2.4 million which will be used mainly to purchase vehicles over the next three years, and Laikipia will, obviously, get a fair share of the vehicles,,</newspeech><newspeech>MR. MUTHURA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister has talked of short-term planning, but the problem is that of long-term planning. In case the Shs.ll6,= or whatever other amount of money Laikipia will get, gets from its share of the Swedish International Development Agency grant gets exhausted,</newspeech><newspeech>MR. MUTHURA (CTD.):	will the Assistant Minister allow the farmers there- to use bulls so that theydo not experience problems?</newspeech><newspeech>MR.

Okay, we will leave his Question until the end.</newspeech>Question No. 626<newspeech>MR. MWACHOFI asked the Minister for Labours-		(a). whether he is aware that Bulleys Tannaries Ltd.,	P. O. Box 15, Thika, declaredworkers redundant paying them	only Shso4,= each;	(b) whether he is further aware that until now 3.39 of these workers have not received any further payments; and	(c) what the reason is for the delay of the paymentsand when they will be paid.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. acrap Metto): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.	(a) I am aware that Bulleys Tannaries Ltd. declared 595 workersredundant with effect from 6th September, 1982, and that every worker was paid	claim at different rates, up to a maximum of Shs.4,=. Thisaction became necessary when the company was placed under receivership, and the amount paid to each worker is the maximum payable under the Companies Act, chapter 486 of the Laws of Kenya.</newspeech>  <newspeech>THE ASSISTANAT MINISTER FOR LABOUR (Mr. arap Metto) (ctd.):(b)	Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am also aware that until now only239 workers, not 339 workers whose claims were above shs.4,= havenot received any further payments because the ReceiverManagers havenot liquidated the Company.	(c)	When the Company is finally liquidated, the amount	of unpaid claims to the affected worksers will be paid in equal	ranking as any other unsecured creditors.</newspeech>	<newspeech>MR. MWACHOFI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the Assistant Minister tell the House who the ReceiverManager and when is the exercise likely to be completed?</newspeech>	<newspeech>MR. arap METTO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not think I am in a position to tell the hon. Member right away who are the Receiver Managers. What I can say is that these workers will be paid as soon as the Company has been liquidated.</newspeech>	<newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, -arising from the previous supplementary question, is the Assistant Minister aware that he has not replied to the question asked by hon. Mwachofi as to who were the ReceiverManagers of the Company. This is because when he was getting the reply to this Question, he should have found out that information and be able to tell us who they are and]when they would be able tocomplete their work whether it .is in the year 2 when we are expecting water all over the country or which year.<subheader>	<newspeech>MR. arap METTO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the original Question did not ask me to give the name of the Receiver, but if the hon. Member and the House needs to know, I will be .in a position to give this information next week on Tuesday.</newspeech>Question No. 589<newspeech>MR. SIFUNA asked the Minister for Transpost and Communications:-(a) whether he is aware that Mr. Jamin M. NdagonaW.PRA 82 stationed at Kisii was dismissed from his services in July, 1982 without valid reason;(b) why his services were terminated; and(c) whether he could investigate further with the possibility of re-instating Mr. Ndagona.</newspeech><newspeech>The assistant minister for transport and communications (MR.Keriri): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(a) I am aware that Mr. Jamin M. Ndagona WPRA82 stationed at Kisii was dismissed from the services on 31st July, 1982 as he failed to prove his suitability for substantive appointment in the post of Executive Assistant.(b)	Mr. Ndagona s. services were terminated because he was involved in many cases of indiscipline including unbecoming conduct, misused of Government vehicles and absolute negligence of his duties.(c)	Mr. Ndagona was dismissed in accordance with the prevailing Civil Service regulations and as such he cannot be re-instated into the service.</newspeech>	<newspeech>	MR. SIFUNA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I know from the hon.Assistant Minister. according to his reply in part (b) what means by unbecoming conduct?. That is too general. Could he tell us what unbecoming conduct was this?</newspeech><newspeech>MR, KERIRI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it was unbecoming conductbecause he engaged in a number of things which were regarded asmisbehaviour and I can give one or two examples. One, on 28th and29th April, 1981, he misused a Government vehicle GK 783 K on two private trips after working hours.</newspeech><newspeech>MR, SIFUNA: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. My point of order is that the hon. Assistant Minister is trying to mislead this Mouse. He has just said in his main reply in part (b)âincluding.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. SIFUNA (ctd, ) : -	unbecoming conduct". That is one. Then he says, "misuso of Government vehicles". Now he is reading to us again this part of his original reply. Wo know that. All that I wanted to know is this unbecoming conduct and not the misuse of Government vehicles. Let him concentrate only on what he means by unbecoming conduct.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. KERIRI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, misconduct  includes misuse of Government vehicles. If the hon. Member wants me to give him other aspects which are different from misuse of Government vehicles, I will do so. At one stage, in june and july,1981, increased the salaries of different casual workers, without the knowledge of the engineer in-charge. He also employed a mechanic at the camp without the knowledge of the engineer in-charge. This was also in June and July, 1981. Another one is that, he wrote letters without the knowledge of the officer in-charge, thus coverstepping his responsibilities. I could even give more of such misconducts of this manias we know him quite well.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. SIFUNA: Mr. Speaker, Sir the information given by the Assistant Minister is still misleading the House. On this question of employing extra workers, he did it as he was directed by his superiors. I wonder whether the Assistant Minister could call this misconduct, when this gentleman had been directed by his superiors to employes those workers,</newspeech><newspeech>MR. KERIRI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, with all due respect to the hon. Member, I think it is his duty, as he is the one who is alleging that this man was given authority to employ these people, to give us evidence, to prove that he was authorised to do that.</newspeech><newspeech>Mr. Speaker : Mr.Onidos question.</newspeech><newspeech>Mr. ONIDO :  Mr.Speaker, Sir, before I ask my Question. I would like to make small correction. In part (a), the second word instead of "is" should be "has".</newspeech>Question No. 62 8<newspeech>MR. ONIDO asked the Minister for Transport and Communications:-(a)	why the widow of the late Hilarius Mudhune PNo.74139 formerly of Kenya Railways has not been receiving any benefits under the widows and children pension scheme; and(b)	whether he would ensure that the widow is paid all the arrears due as a matter of urgency as the deceaseds children cannot go to school for lack of school fees.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS (Mr. arap Koech): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(a)	The lato Mudhune died on l8th December, 198 whereas the Kenya Railways Corporation (Pensions) Regulations, 1983 commenced on 1st January, 1982 for the "dependants Pensions". Since Mr. Madhune died before the introduction of the scheme, his estate could not benefit from it.(b)	All that is lawafully due to the estate of the deceased from the Kenya Railway Corporation, has been fully settled since December, 198l. There is nothing more to be paid from the Kenya Railways Corporation in this connection.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Next Question. </newspeech>	Question No. 621<newspeech>MR. OTWANI asked the Minister for Health:-(a)	whether he is aware that in-patients at Busia General Hospital share beds and that other patients are forced to sleep on the floor due to lack of beds; and(b)	what immediate plans he has to expand, the hospital.</newspeech><newspeech>TIIE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. arap Cheboiwo) : Mr.Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. (a) Yes, I am aware of the problems facing in-patientsat Busia General Hospital.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR HEALTH (Mr. arap Cheboiwo) (ctcl.):(b) As the hon. Member is aware, rccommendation for the expansion of Busia General Hospital should come from the District Development Committee (DDC) of which ho is a member. Recommendation for expansion of the hospital is invited after which we will endevour to find financial resources to expand the hospital.</newspeech><newspeech>MR.EKIDOR: Speaker, Sir, waiting for the DDC to make recommendations is long process. What immediate plans as an Assistant Minister is he taking to alleviate this problem of sharing beds at Busia General Hospital?</newspeech><newspeech>MR. arap CHEBCTWO: The immediate plans we have, Mr. Speaker, Sir, are that as soon as we receive the recommendation from the Busia DDC, we shall take the necessary action.</newspeech><newspeech>MR.SIFUNA: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the answer given by the Assistant Mi raster is quite misleading. We all know that various district development committees have been recommending various projects for implementation by the Government but impleme-ntation has not taken place. Could the Assistant Minister be more honest and tell this House what action he is going to take to solve this problem? The District Development Committee has already submitted its recommendations for the expansion of this Hospital and the Assistant Minister should tell the House when his Ministry is going to provide funds for expansion of Busia District Hospital.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. arap CHEBOIWO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, hon. Sifuna should not tell me to be more honest because I have given an honest answer." He is talking about "various projects" but this Question is specifically talking about Busia District Hospital. If the Busia District Development Committee has sent recommendations to the Ministry, I am sorry to say that we have not received them. If we receive these recommendations we shall take the necessary action Mr. Speaker, Sir, Busia General Hospital has 146 beds and a daily out-patient department attendance of 25 patients. There are at least 2 in-patients in this Hospital at any given time. Busia General Hospital is situated on the border between and Uganda as we are all aware. Consequently, it serves patients from both countries; with an estimated 3 per cent of the patients coming from Uganda. It is a referral hospital for the entire district and it serves a population of approximately 4, people.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. OTWANI: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to know from the Assistant Minister whether it is the Minutes of the D.D.C. that he would like to present or the report, which I believe is in his office? The Minister for Health has personally visitedBusia General Hospital.</newspeech><newspeech>Mr. OTWANI (ctd.) :Does he require me to sent the Minutes of the D.D.C. to the Ministry? If I do it next week will he take action?</newspeech><newspeech>AN HON. MEMBER: Say, "yes"	</newspeech><newspeech>MR. arap CHEBOIWO: Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, </newspeech><newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Mr. Munyaos Question.</newspeech>Question Ho.585<newspeech>MR. MUNYAO asked the Minister for Culture and Social Services:-(a) how much money was granted through E.D.F to the Department of Adult Education in Machakos in 198687 and 198788 on general training, material procurement, model adult education centres, divisional adult education offices, part-time honoraria and literacy campaigns;(b) what are the reasons for the shortfall in allocations in 198788; and(c) whether he is satisfied with literacy campaigns by his officers in this district which has a large percentage of illiteracy and what plans he has to promote the campaigns.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES (Mr. Michuki): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply,(a) External Development Fund grants were allocated for the adult education programme in Machakos for 198687 and 198788 as follows:</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES ( Mr.Michuki) (ctd);ITEM	. 198687	198788Training................ â¦â¦KÂ£.2,.	KÂ£.7,.Materials Procurement.......KÂ£.28,.	KÂ£.:65,.Model Adult Education Centres.KÂ£. 6,.	KX.3,. Divisional Adult EducationOffices.......................................KÂ£ .7,.	KÂ£.35,.Part-time Teachers Honoraria...KÂ£.27,.	KÂ£.27,.Literacy Campaign. â¦â¦.          KÂ£. 6,.	KÂ£. 3,.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the total grants for the two comparative years are as follows: KÂ£.94, in198687 and KÂ£.5, for198788.(b) The funds are provided by the European Economic Commission through the Ministry of Finance, which in turn allocates the said funds to the various Ministries and Departments according to the urgency of their needs and depending on the availability of funds. I am however, aware that two other departments within the Machakos Integrated Development Programme also suffered a shortfall in their 198788 allocations.(c) At the inception of the Department of Adult Education in 1979 the number of illiterate adults in Machakos District was estimated at 272,945 people. This figure influenced the allocation of 575 adult education teachers in the district. Since that time, a total of 12,391 adults have gone through the Adult EducationProgramme and are actively and effectively participating in development activities in Machakos. The Ministry has introduced, on a pilot basis, village resource centres intended for information gathering and dissemination. These centres will not only bring people closer to each other but will also provide fora for exchange of ideas.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES (Mr. Michuki) (ctd);I am therefore satisfied with the literacy campaign in Machakos District.Mr. Speaker, Sir, Machakos District has the highest number of adult education- teachers in the country, and is better provided for in terms of transport facilities because of the special funding by the European Economic Commission. The Ministry will therefore	intensify its efforts in mobilizingwananchi to take advantage of these facilities. The adult education personnel will collaborate more closely with the local and national leaders in the district in order to design more co-ordinated and effective methods of literacy promotion. In addition, the Ministry will introduce specialized skills in the fields of home management and income generation in a bid to make literacy even more functional and relevant to national developments.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order! May I appeal that we try to shorten what we say here because otherwise we will not be able to go through. We should not make it too long.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. MICHUKI: On a point of information, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</newspeech><newspeech> MR. SPEAKER: Yes.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. MICHUKE: It is just the nature of the Question which lengthened this answer. A short summary of this cannot convey the meaning.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: What I mean is that if you look at the Order Paper you will see the remarks âNot Later than 3.3 p.m" which means we have got to limit ourselves to that time. If we are not careful we may find that we cannot go through.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. MUNYAO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, you must have noticed that the answer given by the Assistant Minister is too long. The answer has created total confusion and that is why the Assistant Minister was given such a long reply. Is the Assistant Minister who has also been an Assistant Minister for Finance aware that the shortfall in grants arose as a result of the Machakos Office "being unable to use properly all the money allocated to the District in 198687?</newspeech>	<newspeech>MR. KECHUKE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not aware .</newspeech><newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. It appears there is a small meeting in this corner of the Chamber and we can hardly hear what the Assistant Minister is saying.</newspeech>	<newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Order! Let us confine ourselves to our duties in this HouseYou may repeat your supplementary question, Mr. Munyao.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. MUNYAO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I said that the AssistantMinister, who has also been an Assistant Minister for Finance, and who is more conversant with financial matters than I. Is he aware that the reason why there was a shortfall between 198687 and 198788 is because of the inability of his officers in Machakos to use the money properly?</newspeech><newspeech>MR. MICHUKI: Mr.Speaker, Sir, I am not aware of that.Let me also hasten to add that if I were to go into the question of the shortfall, the shortfall must also reflect the success of implementation because projects which have been executed cannot be revoted for money. The reason why there might not. be more money from that source need not necessarily be what the hon. Member allege to be the case.</newspeech><newspeech>MR MUNYAO: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am a member of the andMachakos District Development Committee (DDC), and this department comes under the Machakos D.D.C. Y re have severally talked about the inability of the officer and  that is why whenever he talks he keeps on discussing his deputies. Is the Assistant minister aware that because of his to implement Concernment projects in Machakos has caused a lot of concern to all leaders. </newspeech><newspeech>MR MICHUKE: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I said that the Ministry is satisfied With the way the literacy programme is taking place in Machakos but if the hon. Member has any specific case, certainly he can come and we discuss it in the Ministry.</newspeech><newspeech>MR.SPEAKER:  Let us go back to Mr. Ndzais Question. MR.

The House and the hon. Members are aware that the Minister of Health was supposed to make a Ministerial Statement today, concerning drugs and many other things. The statement is ready, but he intends to make it himself. As Mr Speaker said that some Ministers are committed elsewhere, he is one of them, and he was unable to come. So, he asked me to convey, his apology to the House and to the Chair he will make this statement next week.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. SHIKDKU: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the House will recall that last week or about two weeks ago, when I  stood on a point of order and requested the Minister for Commerce to come and tell us whether there was any truth in the publication by the Daily Nation to the effect that a Commissioner for Monopolies has been appointed when the Bill has not even been passed by this House. I do not know why the Ministers always ignore, to come and make Ministerial Statements on matters that have been raised in points of order. I am not against her being appointed as a Commissioner for the Monopolies but the procedure is that the Bill must first of all be passed by the House and then the appointment takes place. But here an appointment takes place before the Bill is passed by the House. This is the funny part of it and I wanted the Minister to make a statement as to whether there is any truth that that appointment indeed! take place; Up to now, nobody has replied."Q y SPO.CQ..My-sec.ond point of order is about a Question which I"raised about three weeks, ago, when I requested the Attorney-General.he had promised in 1986 - to look into the question of Chicken and goats of  which had been taken away from people of Butere in Kisa, Kwisero Division. I wanted him to come and tell this House under what law have the chiefs and assistant chiefs got power to take away the property of people? The people of Butere are still insisting and persisting to know this and they want the Attorney-General to tell them under what law the chiefs do this. He promised to come and make a statement on this but he never did so. I do not know whether I should raise this issue under Standing Order No.45 (i) move a Motion Raisin a question of privileged It appears that when the Ministers are required to make statements in this House after a request by Back benchers, they just ignore it and hope that we will forget about it." what should we do, Mr. Speaker Sir?</newspeech><newspeech>MR.

We should be sufficiently understanding and try not to create an image of people who e we cannot find here and therefore, they are wrong. They are committed somewhere else and that is the position. </newspeech><newspeech>MR. SHIKUEU: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

GACHAMJA:  Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker; Sir. My point of order today is to thank the Head of State, His Excellency the President of this Republic for his timely announcement that it is time that the coffee ii export business went to the hands of the Africans. This has been an outcry for a long time and we are now pleased that the Head of State h has said that it is time that the coffee export business must go to the hands of our people. This is a very delicate and very difficult business .In fact, it calls for a lot of money and a lot of support because to be able to buy coffee in an as, auction which calls for millions of pounds is not easy. The Government must come up with a clear-cut policy on how to help these people. My point of order therefore, is to ask the-Minister for Finance to tell this House what exploration he is going to do and how the banks can help our people to be able to conduct this business successfully.</newspeech><newspeech>MR.

When the Minister for Local Government was responding to the comment I made with regard to the up-grading of ICikuyu Trading Centre to an urban centre, he agreed with me that the Kiambu County Council had submitted their recommendations. But he went on to say that a local councillor had raised an objection because the proposed boundary passed through his coffee farm. I want to categorically state here that there is no councilor in Eikuyu Constituency who owns a coffee farm. So, the Minister must have based his decision on wrong information and I should be very grateful if he would make a statement on that matter of fact.</newspeech><newspeech> MR1: CHEPKOK: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

(Minister for Lands and Settlement on 28.1.87) (Resumption of Debate interrupted on 28.1.87) <newspeech>MR. SPEAKER: Mr. Koske was speaking yesterday.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. KOSKE: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was at -foe point of saying that surveyors should not be allowed to run away with wananchis money. I would like to say that those surveyors who have run away with wananchis money should be made to repay that money to the respective farmersMr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to point out that cheap sinde andKunyang Settlement schemes in Kericho District still have problems which have not"been solved for a long time. I had at one time brought a Question to this Houseand although the Minister concerned is still quite aware of the problem, we stillhave a lot of wananchi who are Complaining about inadequate acreage on their farmsWananchi are also complaining about lack of access roads to the main roads. I wouldlike to urge the Minister concerned to see to it that all the wananchi who were givenacreage of land in this area, are provided with access roads. Also the settlement plots which the wananchi have been given should tally with the acreage shown on the title deeds for these plots. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to urge the Ministry to see to it that all wananchi who have been given land in the settlement schemes are giventitle deeds &so that they can get mortgage loans so that they can develop these plots.Mr. Speaker, Sir, most of 1iie area in my constituency formerly European-settled area and quite a number of farms have been subdivided but up to this time, wananchi have not obtained the title deeds. So, I would like to urge the Ministry concerned to make sure that all wananchi whose land has been subdivided fairly are given title deeds without any further delay. Mr. Speaker, Sir5 we have also had problems with the land buying companies. We have for example, the Rift Valley. investment Company which has ran away with wananchis money. I did bring thisto the notice of "the Minister and although the District Commissioner, Kakuru was directed to get that money and give it to (the previous owners, these wananchi are still waiting for their money. So, I would like to urge the Government to see to it that the land-buying companies l which have already taken money from wananchi and have failed to get these wananchi  the land, should give the money back to wananchi. If they do not want to give	wananchi back their money, then they can give them the land and that would be okay.  We would like things to be done immediately after wananchi forward their money. I am saying this because we do not want to bring these complaints here every time.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have also noticed that there are some wananchi. who have obtained land illegally while there are some squatters who are living on that land. Where it has been proved that some people have obtained land illegally, then, Mr. Speaker, the title deeds should be withdrawn and the land issued legally to those who deserve to own it. We have this question of landless people I have genuine landless people in Kericho District who were formerly labours of Kericho. These people lost their land while they were away at (fusinga Island for about 4 years. I would like to request the Government to see to it that these people are settled because they are genuine landless people and they lost their land through no fault of their own. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to urge the Ministry to see to it that is the drier land, which is not occupied at the moment is developed so that it can be given to these people. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to support all hon. Members who have said that all the land in Kenya should be owned by the indigenous people of this country. . I think it is quite unfair for the non-indigenous people in this country to own land while we have wananchi who are landless in their own country MR Speaker, Sir, I would also like to request the Ministry to see to it that land registries are decentralized so that we have land offices in divisions. At the moment , wananchi waste a lot of their time going to the. district commissioners offices and then going back home, they still find their problems not solved. These offices should be decentralized up to divisional level.Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have wrong naming of peoples land. Since it is not the fault of wananchi in having their names wrongly written, I would like to urge the Government to see that the correction of peoples names is done without wananchi being asked to pay for it. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have also noticed that our roads are becoming narrower and narrower. The people living next to the roads should not be allowed to utilize the land adjacent to the roads. Our roads should be wide enough so that vehicles are able to use them properly. With those few remarks, I beg to support.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TOURISM AKD WILDLIFE (Mr. Awori): Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to associate myself with my collegues in discussing this Vote. First of all, I would like to commend the foresight of our Government as at the time of the attainment of our Independence, in negotiating with the colonial Government to repossess the land which was in the hands of the colonialists, in order to settle our people on it. Land is the most important thing that anybody can have anywhere. In fact, land is so important that many people quarrel over its possession. Many times, we have read about brothers killing brothers over the possession of a piece of land which is not worth anybody life. The piece of land under dispute could be as small as one quarter of an acre which at times could be all rocky but, all the same, its possession can cause death. This emphasizes the importance of land. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have talked in this House and other people have debated outside this House, how land changes hands. We have in some of the land registry offices, officers whose conduct needs to be looked into. There have been cases where we find the same piece of land being owned quite legally by two separate people. I have witness case where a piece of land of about 3 acres is owned who by one person has a title deed and at the same time, someone else owns part of that land. It may be owns 15 acres of that land. If you go and measure that land, you will find that it is not possible for those two people to own that land one so that owns, say, 3 acres while the other owns 15 acres. It is important, therefore, that the Ministry of Lands and Settlement looks very carefully as to whom they employ in the land registries.<newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TOURISM ATID WILDLIFE:Mr. Speaker, Sir, it has been stated here that it takes a long time to issue the title deeds. I have never understood why it takes that long. As Members of Parliament, we have quite a number of our constituents coming to us with correspondence, sometimes going as far back as 15 years. Every time a person is told to either come back and prove his case when he has got documents to show that the land is his. And, to make matters worse when we as Members of Parliament take the cases to the officers concerned, there is always the complaint that politicians are interfering with the cases. we would like to work together, both we the politicians and the officers in the land registries because we have the same goal and that is to serve wananchi. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there has been far too much emphasis on the reason for wanting to have title deeds. Every time, my colleagues speak about the issue of title deeds they state that the title deeds are required in order to allow wananchi to acquire loans. I think we should not downplay this question, because now in the rural areas people believe that as soon as you have a title deed, then you should go and acquire a loan. My experience is that the terms governing the issuing of loans have not been fully understood. Quite a number of people believe that the loans that they are acquiring are in fact gifts they are not even supposed to be paid back. I can substantiate this by looking at the recent issues of Kenya Times, where you find a longs list of farms that are being sold by public auction, because farmers who were given loans have failed to pay them back. In fact if you go to check the reasons why they have failed to pay back, it is simply that the loans that they received, were never used for farming at all. I would therefore not like us really overemphasise the question of loans at all. </newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TOURISM AND WILDLIFE Mr. Speaker, Sir, a big size of land in this country is owned by non-indigenous people. I would like to very humbly suggest that it is the high time we started looking into this question to ensure that land owned only by indigenous people and other people can lease this land. In fact, the question of leasing land is working very well in areas like Masai Mara where larger scale farmers are growing wheat. Land should be left entirely in the hands of indigenous people. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in certain areas, we are sub-dividing the land to a very uneconomic size. It would be better now if we put a limit to the extent anyone can sub-divide his land. I would like to suggest that ten acres should be the minimum where land is still available.On the question of land control board membership, we have seen from various places that the problem of double ownership or land being taken away from legitimate owners arises from the composition of land control board. I would like to suggest that before a person is made a member of that board, the whole of his life should be properly scrutinised to see whether he is really an honest person. In this vein, may I request the Minister for Lands and Settlement, to look into the Hakati Land Control Board. Hakati Land Control Board was there at a time when the two constituencies; Bunyala and Busamia fell under one division. Now that the two divisions have been created, may I appeal to the Minister to dissolve the Hakati  Land Control Board and reconstitute the Funyula and Budalanyi Land Control Boards. On the question of surveyors, we have discussed this point early this year. We do not have an adequate number of surveyors. I would like to suggest that we enlarge the training of surveyors so that their services which are badly required in the rural areas are given. Right now, for instance, we in Busia Central, we want to try and create separate areas for.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER PGR TOURISM AND WILDLIPE: commercial, industrial and residential purposes in small townships. All this cannot he done", simply because we are unable to get surveyors.</newspeech>END <newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TOURIST AND WILDLIFE: May I suggest that we increase the number of trainee surveyors. I would now like to touch on the Survey Department. I do not know why we cannot have enough material paper to produce plans. Right now, if one wanted to have a plan of any place, he would be told to come back next month what have you or the next day because paper is not available. Now that we are voting be adequate funds, may I suggest that a share of this money is utilized to import whatever paper is required in order to serve wananchi.Lastly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to say that in townships, we seem to have a mania for wanting to utilize every piece of land that we believe is open. The way we are going in Nairobi, the buildings will be unable to breath. It is essential that we be leaving certain areas to be open spaces areas where those people, for instance who live in flats who have no gardens around their houses, can .take their families and enjoy the With those few remarks, I beg to support.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. KANINDO: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, for giving me a chance to join my colleagues in contributing to this Motion on the Ministry of Lands and Settlement. May I thank the Ministry for the good work it has done 4 hrs particularly in my area where quite a number of people haven now  title deeds. But there is a problem that has started coming up recently which is being experienced by quite a number of people. You find that a certain piece of land has two title deeds. Quite a number of people in that area have approached me with that kind of problem. You find that a person who has been holding a title deed for a certain piece if of land| since 197, finds somebody else with a title deed for the same piece of land issued a few years after the original title deed holder has got his and is staying on that piece of land. This practice is rampant in South Nyanza. This should be looked into by the district land registrar to find out why two title deeds have been issued for the same piece of land. This problem is, landowners who are not rich enough to fight it out with those who are rich hard time. This should be checked before it gets out of hand. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is also a problem with leases in urban areas such as Awendo, Migori, Oyugis, Kendu Bay, Rodi Kopan, Ndhiwa and Mbita. You find that for many years since we achieved Independence, those plots which were allocated in these towns, for which the owners would like to have title deeds in order to lease them to those who would. want them or for the sake of taking loans, have not had their title deeds released. This is when because the County Council of South Nyanza forwarded these request, they were told that the title deeds could not be released because the report it was not ready. I think somebody, somewhere, who should take up this matter is dragging his feet and refusing to issue those title deeds to those plot owners who were allocated the land 15 or 2 years ago. This problem blocks these land owners from getting loans from banks, and other, organizations to enable them to put up buildings on those plots. These organizations say, "if the lease is not there, how do we come in? This should, be speeded up and things should be seen to be moving. The other problem which has been dragging this district behind other parts of the country is the issue of surveyors. One has to travel several times to Migori in order to get a surveyor to come to surveyor his land after the land board has accepted to effect sub-division of land. This is another area which should be looked into Surveyors should be made available so that they move into the areas where sub-division is required. Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I take this opportunity to request the South Nyanza Sugar Company, which is have been aware that we are dealing with the issue of land, to allow the farmers to use their land to the maximum Trains because there is a restriction on those who would like to use the land to the maximum, to benefit from sugar-cane farming. I know this does not come under the Ministry of Lands and Settlement, but we are talking on how to make maximum use of land. So, I would like to request this sugar company to allow those people with less than acres to grow sugar-cane. People surrender their land for the nucleas and as such, the land they have remaining cannot measure up to seven acres. So, they cannot benefit from this programme. But when there was the Mehta management, even those with two acres of land were allowed to grow sugar-cane. These people have, therefore, benefitted by building schools and paying school fees for their see secondary school children and they are also able to live in decent houses since they get proper payment from their sugar-cane proceeds. So, these people should be allowed to grow sugar-cane.Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are  people who were removed from their land when the nucleas estate was being established. The number of people who were rendered landless were about 5. I brought a Question in this House asking whether these people could be settled because they have no land and so when such people die in urban centres, it becomes a problem to e get them a place in which to be buried. The fact of the matter is that there could be some land somewhere where some people had been living before demarcation took place. The sad eÂ£ fact of it is that the Luos and have the kissis who have been living in this area are being removed. This adds the number of those landless. I appeal to the Ministry of Lands and Settlement to settle this problem because up to now, those who appealed have not had their cases heard. Their cases are being delayed and this is giving them problems because they are depending on relatives and yet they have been having their own crops such as bananas which had been planted on this land. If they have to be removed from this area because they have failed to meet the requirements of living there, they should be compensated for "whatever was taken from them if alternative land cannot be found. But the best thing would have been for them to be given alternative land during the time of demarcation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, now that we are about to pass this vote of the Ministry of Lands and Settlement we  hope that the Government will provide the surveyors we need in order to have demarcation. I would also like to urge the Ministry to work seriously on the areas in which they have not demarcated land so these people can  also benefit from the title deeds which are due to them so that they can also utilize them like the other Kenyans in this Republic .With those few remarks, I beg to support.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES (Mr. Nassir)Btf, Spika, ninakushukuru kva kunipatia nafasi hii ili nam pia niweze kusema u amachache juu ya Vizara ya Ardhi na Makao ambayo inafanya kazi nzuri sana katika Kenya ambayo inaleta anani na ambayo iraeweza kuwafundisha Vakenya jinsi yakumiliki ardhi na pia kuyeza kutatua shida yoyote ikitokea baiha ya watu.wawili wanaopigania shamba mojaeBw Spikay yangu ni kuomba Serikali itoe msaada vowote kva Wizara. hii kvra vile hata wafanyakazi wake ni vachache na kazi wanazofanya ni nyingi.

Hilo ni jambo moja linalochelewesha upimaji na uandikishaji mashamba katika nchi hii, na ninaomba field allowances zao zior.gezwe na pia mambo mengine madogo madogo yanayowadhuru yarekebishwe. ITikishasema hivyo, Bw.. Spika, nataka sasa kuzungumza juu ya habari za rufani za Waziri - Ministers Appeals - kuhusu kesi za mashamba. Kwa wakati huu klxna fca rufani nyingi sana za kesi za mashamba z ambazo ni za zamani sana, na ambazo hazijasikilizwa. Inajulikana vizuri kwamba kaha kabla rufani hizi hazi jasikilizwa, hati za kumiliki mashamba haziwezi kutolewa. Hivi majuzi wakuu wa ixxs. Wilaya.</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. LUKENDO (ctd.)valiostaafu walikuwa karibu kumaliza rufani hizi lakini hata wao wameshindwa kabisa na rufani hiso zinaendelea kujazana katika ofisi ya Waziri wa Ardhi na Makao. Kwa hivyo, namwomba tfaziri afikirie njia ya kuzifhmguza rufani hizi ili kuharakisha mpango wa kutoa hati za kumiliki mashamba katika nchi hii.Bw. Spika, nikigusia kuhusu Idara ya Usorovea, namwomba liaziri afikirie kurudia mipaka ya mashamba, hasa yale yaliyokuwa ya Wazungu. Nasema hivyo laa sababu kuna e Yfazungu wengine ambao waliacha mashamba yao na hawakusema kama wali-yaachia Serikali au watu binafsi. Haya mashambani yale yanayoitwa unclaimed land. Â¥azungu walioachwa hapa nchini wameyachukua mashamba haya na kuyachanganya na yale yao hivi kwamba ikiwa shamba lilikuwa la ekari 2,, sasa limekuwa la ekari 35,. Wazungu hao waliwaajiri masorovea binafsi ambao walitoa beacons za zamani na kuweka nyingine. Kwa hivyo, natoa mwito kwa iaziri wa Ardhi na Makao ajaribu kulirekebisha jambo hili kwa kurudia upimaji wa mipaka ya zamani ndipo mashamba y2ii yaliyonyakuli na Wazungu waliobaki hapa yachukuliwe na kupatiwa wananchi. Mwisho kabisa, nataka kusema kwamba wakati m. I-itukufu Rais alipoongosa mkutano wa kuchangisha pesa katika v.undanyi alipendekeza kwamba ili kuwasaidia wananchi wa 2iz tfilaya ya Taitaraveta, ekari 5, zitengwe Irutoka katika Tsavo National Park na kupatiwa wananchi. Kwa hakika, zaidi ya asilimia 75 ya ardhi ya Wilaya ya Taitaraveta imsKkui imechukuliwa na Tsavo National Park. Sz Sasa miaka mitatu na nusu imepita tangu Mtukufu Rais alipotoa agiso hilo na hakuna lolote lililofanyika. Yafaa Mzle22x tfaziri wa Ardhi na Kakao, akishirikiana na Waziri wa Utalii na Â¥anyama wa Porini na Wasiri wa Kilimo wakae chini na kuona ni wapi. wanapoweza kukata hizi ekari 59 C. Hao rn Mawaziri watatu ndio waliopewa jukumu la kutafuta uwezekano wa kukata hizo ekari za ardhi. Kwa hivyo, namtaka Waziri wa Ardhi na Makao, atakapokuwa akijibu Ho ja hii, agusie kidogo kuhusu jambo hili la ekari 5Â» za ardhi aabazo Htukuru Rais alisema zipativre wananchi wa Wilaya ya Taitaraveta ambao wamekuwa wakingojea kwa hamu sana; wanataka kuona jsfeeris ya Mtukufu Rais sk jfeitimiswcna Icutekelezwa.Kwa hayo machache, Bw. Spika, naiunga Ho ja hii mkono.</newspeech><newspeech>MR.OLE KENA: Ahsante sana, Bw. Spika, kwa kunipa nafasi hii namv nitoe maoni yangu juu ya Wizara hii ya Ardhi na Makao.Bw. Spika, mimi nikiwa Mbunge wa Mawakilisho ya K Kajiado South, sina vita na hii Wizara. Kazi ya usorovea kit huko Kajiado iko karibu kwisha na lcila mtu amepata cheti chake cha kumiliki shamba. ICwa hivyo ninaishukuru Wizara hii	jf.sana kwa kazi hiyo nzuri. Tumepata maendelea mengi sana na hii yote jobni kwa sababu ya hii Vizara. Watu wengi wamepata mikopo kwa	kutumia vyeti vyao vya kumiliki mashamba.Ti."Bw. Spika, ningependa kusema kidogo juu ya group VAAcUi rsaaee-s kwa sababu nchi yetu imegawanywa mara mbili. Kuna	sehemu ya group ranches na sehemu ya mashamba ya watu binafsi.	Kwanza nitaongea juu ya group ranches ambako watu wengi wanaishi. fFrKwa miaka mingi tumeona kuwa wale watu wanaoishi katika group	KjtHEH ranches hawajaendelea sana. , kwa sababu wana ardhi kubwana bado wanazurura kama zamani. Tulipokuwa kwa mkutano huko Wilayani Kajiado, tuliamua hizo group ranches zigawanywe ili kila mtu apate sehemu	yake. Lakini kabla ya haya-mashamba hayajagawanywa, ni lazima wale watu ambao wamezaliwa pale na wameishi pale kwa muda mrefu kama vile miaka 18 au 2 waandikishwe kwanza. Hii ni kwa sababu watu wale walioji-andikisha wakati group ranches ziTlipcanzishwa wanataka sheria iliyoko sasa kwamba hakuna ruhusa ya kuandikisha watu wengine wapya isipokuwa wale wabioandikishwa wakati hizi group ranches zilipoanzishwa. Sheria hii inavanyima watu ambao walizaliwa baada ya hizi group ranches kuanzishwa haki yao. Tukikubali hawa watu kasxk kukaa bila makao ni vibaya kwa sababu wana}?boma zao hapo, walizaliwa hapo na watoto wao wanasomea hapo.</newspeech><newspeech>MR.OLE KENA (CTD.):Utaratibu hi huu utatuletea matata. ICwa hivyo, ningependa kumwabia Bw. Wasiri kwamba kabla it group ranches hasijagawanywa ni lazima watu wote waliofikia umri wa 15 na kuHnnsxes zaidi waandiki shwe tl kwanza.Ningependa kusema jambo kuhusu mashamba ya watu binafsi nalo ni lile la uuzaji wa mashamba ; Shamba ni mali ya maÂ£u a na ana.haki ya kuliuza akitaka. Lakini kuna watu wengine ambao ni wa w.:5 m wazembe na wengine ambao ni walafi sana na wanapelekwa kuhongwa pahali ambapo sitataja na kusahau kwamba wana familia, na was?.i:giii-a kuu_za mashamba kichinichini. Wakati mashamba yanapouzwa ni lazima TCizara hii, na Land Control Board iangalie na kuhakikisha kwamba kabla shamba halijauzwaj, familia nzima imekubaliana. </newspeech><newspeech>MR. OLE KENAH (Contd.):Ni laz a n ci mii ikubaliane. Lakini siyo mzee auze shamba peka yake halafu jamii yote inakuja kuharaishwa, na haijui itakwenda wapi. Jambo hilo litaleta matata baadaye kwa sababu jamii hiyo haitakuwa na mahali pa kuishi. Kwa hivyo, jambo arabalo ningependa kutaja hapo juu ya individual ranches au mashamba ya watu binafsi ni kwamba ni laziina tuwe waangalifu kwa kukubali mashamba kuuzwa. Shamba au ardhi ni lci-fcu ambacho binadamu hutegemea kwa maisha yake, na kwa hivyo, haifai tulichukue jambo hilo kama jambo la rahisi, au jambo la kukubali na kalamu na kuweka sahlhi. Yafaa tufikirie watu wengine ambao maisha yao hutegemea ardhi. Kwa hivyo, ni lazima jambo hilo lichunguzwe sana na Vizara, kwamba mtu akitaka kuliuza shamba ni lazima wale watu ambao wanalitegemea shamba hilo wakubali.Jambo lingine, Bw. Spika, ambalo ningependa kutaja ni juu ya thamani ya ardhi au mashamba. Nafahamu kwamba Wizara ina valuers. Ajabu ni kwamba mtu mwingine anaweza kuwa na shamba. la ekari 1, mahali fulani, hasa katika arid au semi-arid zone. Pia, katika mahali pengine mtu mwingine anaweza kuwa na shamba la ekari 2. Ajabu ni kwamba ukilinganisha thamani ya shamba la ekari la 2 na ile ya ekari 1, utaona kwamba shamba la ekari 2 lina thamani lcubwa kuliko lile shamba la ekari 1,. Hii siyo haki. Ni lazima tuwe sawa.  Ni lazima tuone kwamba kila sehemu inatendewa vizuri, Najua kuna mashamba mengine ya ekari kama 3., ambayo yarueuzwa. Mtu amechukua mkopo wa kama Sn.2,- na shamba hilo likaja kuuzwa kwa ShÂ»2,-. Hii siyo haki hata kidogo. Jambo hilo linategemea thamani 3a shamba hilo. Kwa hivyo, ni lazima Wizara iing.ilie jambo hilo kuona kwamba kila sehemu ina thamani jrake lakini kusiwe na tofauti kubwa sana kati ya thamanai hxzo mbili.Tunajua kwamba kuna sehemu nyingine ambako watu wamefanya maendeleo, na mambo hayo yo.te huhesabiwa. Lakini hatutaki kuwe na .</newspeech><newspeech>MR. ole KENAH (Contd.):tofauti kubwa sana kwa upande wa tharnani ya mashamba hayo. Tunataka tofauti hiyo iwe kidogo tu.Jambo lingine ni juu ya townships. Ni lazima tuwe na mipango katika townships kwa sababu tusipokuwa na mipango ya townships kama Namanga, Kajiado na kadhal.ika, upssi iwezekanavyo, utaona kwamba watu wanaanza kuingilia kujenga njnimba na italcuwa shida kuwaondoatena wakati inipango itakapofanywa. Kwa hivyo, ni lazima Wizara hii vile vile iingilie kwa haraka sana jambo hilo. Natoa mfano wa iuji wa Namariga ambao ni wa zamani sana, Lakini ukienda huko utaona kwamba nyumba zote ni kiosks tu na hali ni township ambajo iko chini ya Kamishna wa Ardhi. Mipango imefanywa kwa miaka mingi lakini hatujaona matokeo 3rake mpaka leo. Watu w.anazidi kujenga semi-permanent houses, kiosks na kadhalika, na itakuwa vigumu baadaye Icuja kumwanibia mtu ambaye amejenga: "Ondoka hapo kwa sababu hiyo siyo ploti yakoj tumeipatia mtu mwingine". Kwa. hivyo, tukitaka kuyazuia mambo kama hayo ni lazima tufanye mipango ya mijengo katika miji etu. Vile vile, Vizara itoe misaada ya kuziwezesha local authoritie kupanga trading centres zao ili na wao vile vile wasianze kujenga nyumba kulingana na vile watu wanavyotaka, bali wafuate mipango ambayo inahitajika katika ujenzi wa townships au trading centres.Kwa hayo machache, Bw. Spika, naomba icuung s. mkono.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. DOMETT: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to contribute to the debate on this very important Ministry dealing with an important commodits, that is land.Mr. Speaker, Sir, land in Kenya is- a very valuable and a very burning issue, and it should be taken as such wherever we deal with it, especially in areas that people have moved into, such as the former so-called "White Highlands". Mr. Speaker, Sir, the confusion that arises even when people have bought land stems and starts from the Ministry itself at the	Headquarters. "Ardhi House" is a source of a lot of uncalled for confusion. In fact. I do know of several plots or farms in my Constituency whose ownership is being disputed, and when you go into it, you find that one land has two title deeds. You wonder how the	f"obtained the two title deeds. If you go deep into it, you find that it is done in the Ministry of Lands and Settlement at the Headquarters. It is very surprising to find people who are supposed to be educated,Vtrained and disciplined can allow such matters to crop up. It is really unbelievable how a surveyor can fail to place beacons on the id and recommend the issuance of one title deed instead of two.	;I do not know how this happens because I have registered my land, and I know how it is being done. It is done meticulously, and with a lot of care. So, when there is confusion, it is deliberate. In fact, it is just corruption.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe that the Minister will be able to tell us the reason why this is happening. If he does not tell us, then he should put a stop to this type of thing because a lot of people have suffered. Families have quarrelled, and the quarrels have persisted for years and years, and brings disunity to our people. This is a land of love, peace and unity. We cannot have that when we have quarrels brought about because of land.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Survey Department is also bringing a lot of problems because of surveyors. I know of a farm known as "Dimu Farm" in Rift Valley. The directors of this farm had a plan from the Central Land Board, and they were allowed to subdivide the land. Then later on when the directorship changed, they had another plan which was allowed and they said: "This is the right plan". So., they had one plan in 1981; they had another one in 1983, and they have another plan now. Who issues these plans, and what are they for? Are they meant to confuse the people? If you give illiterate people a chance to quarrel, I am sure they will do so. They can even kill themselves. The officers who do this will be answerable, if not on earth, in Heaven.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do say that money can be very "sweet", but it is the source of a lot of evil. In fact, if you go to a farm where there is quarrel, they say that the head of the Survey DepartÂ¬ment has a plot on that farm. If you go to another farm in Solai, he also has a plot there too, and so on. Although he does not say that he has one, the owners of the land say that they have given him a piece of land. That may be untrue in one case, but it cannot beuntrue in the second, third, fourth and the fifth incidence. Where thereis smoke there is fire. It is only befitting that the head of the district survey officers should be changed frequently so that they do not entrench themselves and become "kings". In fact, they go round collecting money. I understand there is a very intricate way of doing this. They do not do it themselves, but they use second or third persons. But nonetheless, they still reap the benefits. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I call upon the Minister to help this country by making sure that one man does not remain in one place for a long time. In fact, I understand that the Nakuru District Land Officer has been there for 13 years; 13 years is too long a period for an officer to be in one place. In fact, by now he should be in Kilifi District and the Kilifi District Land Officer should have come up to Kapsabet, and so on and so forth. This will eradicate temptations of corruptions, although our people are also at times to blame; they may try to induce the officers. We should move the officers more frequently, so as to minimise these temptations. This way the officers will not be easy to bribe and will also not be tempted by our people.     Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I said, land is very important commodity. I think that without planning for land, we cannot develop this country. We have developed our agriculture sufficiently, although there is room for more development. Now,we need to develop commerce and industry. We can only do that if our little trading centres all over the country, of course Nakuru being first, have officers issuing title deeds, which our traders can use to borrow money and develop their small-scale businesses, and also spa spread industries in the rural areas. So, this can only be possible if people in every trading centre have title deeds.I would I also like to appeal to the county-councils not to give out land set aside for trading centres. Sometimes, as soon as a county council gets land, say 1 acres, that land is sub-divided overnight and. given out to individuals; sometimes, one individual receives up to 1 plots without any justification. We have a lot young men and women who have left school; these young people will not get a share of family land, but they can apply for and get plots in trading centres. Therefore, we should not see be very greedy. So, county councils should make sure that land is not given out overnight, and that they give out land when there is actual need. They should not give out land to people so as to please them, or to enable them sell it in the end and get money, which they are not justified to get.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will end up by saying that land in Nairobi is very import anand valuable. As we said when we were passing the Land Act here land should be set aside	for the âsonsâ of the soil. I also know that there is land which has not been in use, and whose owners have not been in this country for the last 3 or 4 years, yet they still own such land. I think that such land should he and distributed to Kenyans who are in need of it, and who will make s use of it. This is because I do not think that it is fair for a man who is New Delhi to benefit from the fruits of our land here in Kenya; nor should a man in London be receivingbenefits from land, since his forefather did not fight for or pay any royalties so as to justify ownership.Mr. Speaker, Sir, we support this Ministry because it is doing a very important job, but I still appeal to its officers to realise that they have got a job to do. I there Will be a problem in the country, it will stem from this Ministry. So, they should know that the responsibility on their shoulders is very heavy indeed. In fact, when We go to land offices, sometimes we find that files are missing. It is only when we have talked a little bit that they reappear. I do not know how they can disappear and then reappear. Maybe, things happen this way when we talk sweet, or grease the palms of certain people.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the Motion.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. JALDESA: Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to say a few words on the Vote of the Ministry of Lands and Settlement. This is a very important Ministry in the sense that it takes care of the land and anything concerning land, tends to be very sensitive all the time.First of all, I would like to thank the Ministry, for having established a land registry in Isiolo District. It is only last year when they managed to put an office there. Previously, the Ministry of Lands and Settlement was not represented in Isiolo District. The Ministry did a good thing in this respect. Despite the fact that the Ministry has established an office there with qualified personnel, they do not have any facilities to enable them carry out the work. It is practically useÂ¬less to have qualified officers there who cannot do anything due to lackof facilities. The Minister should do something about it and see to itthat when they established offices somewhere, they should also make provision for equipment and other facilities. Another thing I would like to touch on is the allocation of plots.It is becoming a bit confusing as to who is actually responsible for allocationof plots. This is because we have the central plot allocation committee inthe district which is chaired by the District Commissioner; we have the countycouncil plot allocation and planning committee; the provincial commissionerand the Ministry of Lands and Settlement, which axe all responsible for thisexercise. We do not know who is exactly responsible for what because thereseems to be a lkot of duplication of duties. We would like to know whois exactly responsible. At times, a plot is allocated by the district development committee under the cover of the district development plan. This can easily create a lot of corruption. We would like to know who is specifically responsible for what.Time and again, I have raised Questions in this House regarding the physical planning of some of the trading centres in my constituency. For example, we have fast growing towns like Garba Tula, Modogashi, Sinya and  Sericho and the district development committee has recommended several times that the physical planning of these towns "be carried out. Up to now, there is nothing forthcoming; we do not know what is happening. We have so many qualiÂ¬fied officer at Ardhi House and others in the provincial headquarters who should do this work. What is so difficult in carrying our the physical planning, survey work and so on? It is high time the Ministry utilized the qualified personnel they have in this Republic. For example, in my home District, Isiolo, it. is only Isiolo town which is served by this Ministry while the rest of the district, as big as it is, has practically nothing going  on as far as this Ministry is concerned.I would like to touch on a very sensitive aspect which is on the district boundaries. I do not know when these boundaries were last reviewed. The way the boundaries of Isiolo District were designed, leaves a lot to be desired. For example, from Isiolo town, there is only a distance of one kilometre to Meru town; from a place called Kilamawe in my constituency, it is only a river which is in Isiolo District while the rest of the land is in Meru District. We are having problems because the Meru District Development Committee does not take care of the IsioloKilamawe Road. In the real sense,that road is in my constituency. According to the set boundaries I do notknow how they were designed that road is in Meru District. The people of Meru District do not have any link with that area. It is high time the boundaries were reviewed to reflect some sense. At the moment, it seems that some of these boundaries do not make any sense.	When a plot is being allocated, it takes about one year or so before one is issued with a title deed. I do not know what the problem is in this respect. Issuing of title deeds is, in my opinion, just paper work. The Ministry should do something to improve and hasten this exercise. For example, when someone is allocated a plot and all the relevant documents and authority are there, then what is the difficult in issuing the title deed? They should try to improve those areas which do not need experts to do the job.Mr. Speaker, Sir, due to the shortage of qualified surveyors inthe Ministry, people are forced to engage the services of private survyors.The fees charged by these private surveyors are so is exorbitant that the ordinary mwananchi cannot at times afford to have his land surveyed. The Minister should have control over these private surveyors. They should at least charge reasonable fees. For example, if I want to carry out surveys in Isiolo District and I engage the services of a private surveyor, it becomes very difficult and sometimes in ossible. It is high time the Ministry did something about this issue. With these few remarks, I beg to support. </newspeech><newspeech>MR.

KflALIF: Thank you very much Mr." Speaker, Sir, forgiving me this opportunity to also. Contribute to the Vote of this very important Let me tell you from the outset sir that if I were parochial and did not have a national outlook, I would have opposed this Ministrys Vote because it has done nothing in my district. It is now 25 years since we attained our idependence, and there are only three people who own title deeds for their land in Wajir District. Those people have done so by hiring private surveyors and doing everything themselves. This state of affairs has continued in spite of our repeated pleas and requests to the	Ministry through all the various forums such as; the District Envelopment Committee;the District Commissioner and the ProvincialCommissioner officers. We have even presented the request in the form ofa memorandum to the highest authority in this country. Due tolack of title deeds, people in Wajir District cannot solicit anymoney from their banks. There is a bank in Wajir town now, andthere are very many good business men who should be loaned money,but they have no security. They have no security because theirland have not been surveyed, and they have not been given titledeeds. The Minister is very much aware of this. We have held.Disiussions with his predecessors regarding this issue several	times. I remember going to see him once	he took over the portfolio 		 of running this particular Ministry.			I would, again like to take this opportunity to most sincerely an earnestly plead with him to facilitate the quick surveying ofwajir towns so that people can get their title deeds.	Mr. Speaker, Sir, having said that, land is a very sensitiveIssue.As many of my colleagues have said, people in this country  fought and shed blood to own their land. It is very serious and unanderstandable that 25 years after attaining independence there are people who own land in this country, and yet they livein some far distant places such as Paris and England. These people never come here to develop their-farms. It is very unfortunate that there are some wananchi who live in these farms as squatters. It is a high time the Kenya Government looked into this matter. I know that the Constitution of Kenya guarantees the rightful ownership of property, but I also think that it is very unfair for somebody to own land and not to develop it, thus denying others the right to develop it. This is what is happening in Kenya, wananchi are living in their own country as squatters. Time and again this problem" has "been raised in this House very vehemently, but nothing seems to be done. </newspeech>	<newspeech>MR. EHALIF (CTD.):It is high time that the Minister responsible for this Ministry, and theGovernment as a whole, come up with a deliberate policy to solve this veryserious problem.Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point I would like to mention concernssettlement schemes. There are various settlement schemes all over the countrywhere the landless are settled, Those are national projects, and the fairthing for the Ministry or whoever is in charge of the administration of theseschemes would have been to go round the country and distribute the schemesfairly and evenly so that people from North-EasternProvince, Coast Province and all other provinces have a chance of beingsettled there. In some settlement schemes you will find that only one section		of the Kenyan community being predominantly given the opportunity to settle there.I do not want to mention the names of those schemes becausethey might stir up some very emotional controvesy.The other problem I would like to mention is in regard of boundaries,Eon colleagues have mentioned this problem before. Our boundaries shouldreflect the reality. Garissa Town, for example, which I am sure you had theopportunity to visit, is the Headquarters of North-Eastern Province but,amusingly, the town is part and parcel of Coast Province. Anyone who .ownsland in this town has to go to Tana River for all administrative purposesThis is clearly very incongruous. You have Garissa as the seat of North-EasternProvince, and yet people there have to go to Tana River, which is about 8 or9 miles away, any time they want to process any documents regarding their plotsof land. So, this towns boundaries should be removed. This affects many otherplaces, and not just Garissa. Even in Wajir District, there is a lot of incongruosity in respect of boundaries It is high time that we reviewed ourboundaries in order that they, may reflect the reality of the dayComing back to the problem in Wajir, let me say that Kandera District,which is about 4 miles from wajir and borders Somalia, has been surveyed andpeople there are pastoralists as are those in Moyale and all other major towns   in North-Eastern Province. All these other towns have been surveyed., and Ido not know why the Ministry is taking so long to survey Wajir Town. Thepeople there are very much concerned about this issue. I would like to repeatray appeal to the Minister to send a team of experts to Wajir District forthis purpose. I understand that there is a system whereby this team has tofly and do some aerial survey, after which they know who has been allocated aplot and who should be given a title deed. I do not know much about thosetechnicalities, but the Minister should do everything possible to solve thisproblem. I say this with all my emotion because my constituents have sentme here to tell the Minister in no uncertain terms that he should do something in this regard. If there were some other ways of challenging the Ministrys apathy in this case, I would even have taken this matter to court. Why is theMinister denying the people of Wajir the right to own their land legally., I think the Minister has taken down my point in good faith in spite of my high emotion. I hope he understands the predicament of the people of Wajir very well and that he will address himself to this problem, which is peculiar to Wajir only.	I have not talked about airports. .Even other Members of Parliamentare having problems with their airports in the small towns that are coming up now. Wajir Town, the centre of Forth-Eastern Province, has not title deeds, 25 years after attaining Independence. This is a shameWith these few remarks, I wish to plead with the Minister to do everything possible for Wajir I beg to support the Motion, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</newspeech><newspeech>MR.

Spifca, ambalo linahusiana na hilini    juu ya agizo ambalo ndugu yangu, rahe. Lukindo, alilita j a Katika nwaka wa 1985. Mtukufu Rais alikuva VAindanyi kuendesha nichango va Karambce na akaagiza  si kupendekeza  kvamba maofisa wa Tvizara ya Ardhi na Makao, Vizara ya utaiii na Wanyama va Porini vakutane na wapendekeze mahali kando kando ya Mto va Tsavo ambapo ekari 5, zingotoleva kva vale vananchi . va Vilaja ya TaitaTavcta ambao liawana ardhi, ili v;apate nafasi ya kulir.ia. Jambo hili kvoli turn el i fuat il ia hapa Bungeni na hata katika vikao vinginc, kama vile kwenye kamati ya maendeleo vilayani na kamati ya kilimo vilayani. Jambo la kusi itisha ni kvanba tang.I siku hiyo mpaka leo, agizo ambalo lilitolcva na Mtukufu Rais h a 1 i j a t c k e e zv a na Vizara zinazohusika zinaondcloa kunjanaza kimya. Hii ndio maana tungenipenda V.aziri, atakaposimama kujibu Ho j a hii, Vaclcza ni lcva nini agizo hilo la Mtukufu Rais lime endclea kupuuzva, na vananchi wanaendolea kupata tarbu katika nchi yao  Katika Vilaya ya TaitaTavota,  zaidi ya asilimia 75 ya ardhi inashikiliwa na Serikali na vananchi wanaachiwa labda asimilia 1 au chini ya hiyo tu.	Bv. Spika, jambo 1 inirj hasa katika Vilaya ya TaitaTaveta, ni kwamba Wizara imefanya kazi nzuri katika scherzu. fulani ya kuunganisha na kuanaiki slia mashamba. Lakini makosa machache yametokea ambayo tuneyatoa na kuyataja katika vikao vya Kamati ya Maendeleo Wilayani na Kamati za KilimoWilayani na tungependa ayarekebishe marabo haya Ningependa kumtajia Waziri;na nashukuru kwamba maofisa wanaosimamia idara mbalimbali za Wizara hiyo wako hapa Kosa la kwanza ni kwamba? wakati mashamba yalipimva na kuandikishwat hasa katika sehemu ya mi lima huko Wundanyi, Wizara hii haikushauriana na Wizara ya Kilimos Ninasema hivyo kwa sababu kuna sehemu fulani huko ambazo hazifai kulimwa lakini sasa zimepewa watu na nyingine zina maji na zilifaa kutengwa lakini hazikutengwao Makosa haya yalitokea kwa sababu vale ambao walikuwa vanautekeleza mpango	huu walikuwa hawana utaalamu unaohusiana na kilimoo Huu lidiovakati ambapo Wizara hii inapasva ifikirie juu ya watu hawa waiiopewa sehemu hizo ziv;e zao.kama watapewa ardhi nyingine wapi valine ili sehemu hizi nyingine zihifadhiweo Hii ni kwa sababu atunazungumzia juu ya uhifadhi wa maji na udongoEoaa lingine, M Bw. Spika? limetokea sehemu ambako ktuneandiki shwa mashamba ya malisho ya vikundi au group ranches Nishauliza Svali katika Bunge hiii miaka miwili au mitatu hivi iliyopita kama Mkuu wa Sberia anatosheka kuarrba sheria ya group ranches haihitilafiani na sheria ya kuandikisha mashamba ya kibinafsio Alipozungumza hapa mhe. ole Kena? araeonyesna Ja vazi vile mashamba ya group ranches yanavyoshindwa kuendelea kwa sababu hayana usimamizi sawasavae Kosa lililotokea hasa katika Wilaya ya Taita Taveta ni kwamba mashamba mengine yalipondiki shwa, wananchi waliokuwa a wana haki ndani ya yale mashamba, riajina yao hayakuwako katika orodha ya wenye kumiliki mashamba  hayo. Kv.a hivyo, baada ya mashamba haya kuandikishwa, wananchi wcngine vanakatazva kuingia kv.cnye mashamba hayo. Mfano in mo ja ns. ni kama vile kulc Isanga Iwishi Group Ranch, ambako vatu wa Mwanda Su-location wanakatazwa kuingia kwenye mashamba na hali wana halci ya kuwa hapo tangu zaraani Mfano mwingine Bw.Spika ni shamba la Ndara Dambamo	wananchi kutoka Loke sherd ya Chewia na pia Lokesheni ya Mb alewalikataswa wasiirgie pamoja na wale ambao wameandikishwa.Hilini jambo archaic linaweza kuzusha hali ya katoelewana na kuharibikakwa amani.Pia jambo hili linajulikana lava Kamati ya Maendeleoya Wilaya ya Taita Taveta. Kwa hivyo ningeiomba Wizara inayohusikaiingilie kati kuwaamuru wenye lile shamba wawaruhusu wale wenye	hakx A Yengine majina yao yaingizwe katika orodha.	5 Bwo Spika ingawa mud a unaonekana hautoshi ningependakutaja jambo moja muhimu sana hapa kuhusu Taita-Taveta Wilaya	ya Taita-Taveta, sawa na wilaja nyingine, ina watu wazaliwa wa	i wilaya yenyewei Ninasema hivi bila kuzungujaza juu ya ukabila. sawa kutoka wilaya fulani na kwenda katika wilaya nyingine na	kujipatia ardhi bila ya idhini ya wale wanaoishi pale.

Lakini utaona	kwamba nyumba hizo zote hazina hati zinazohitajika. Kwa hivyo	wafanyabiashara wanakosa njia ya kukopa pesa ili kuziendelezabiashara zao	Naunga mkono, Bw Spika.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR LABOUR(Mr. arap Metto): Ahsante sana, Bw.Spika, kwa kunipatia nafasi ili Mweze kuungana na wabunge wenzarigu kutoa maoni. juu ya Wizara hii ambayo ni ya maana sana.Sitasema raengi kvwa sababu waziri amefanya kazi kulingana na vile  maongozi ya Serikali yalivyo. Ninasema hivyo lava sababu hapo awali tulikuwa na matatizo mengx. Mara tu iEiissgxsxtulipo jinyakulia Uhuru wetu vananchi waliungana pamoja kama partners, vyama vya ushirika ili kununua mashambao Serikali yetu, kupitia katika Wizara Mi, imefanya kazi ya maana sana kuha- kikisha kwamba  mashamba yaliyokuwa ya Wazungu re yame chukuJLiwa na	wanancM ili waweze kuyatumia kujitajirisha na pia kuliwezesha taifa Mli kujitegemea kwa utoaji wa chakula.Lakini baadaye, Bw.

Akifanya hivyo atakuwa amefanya kazi muhimu sana na atakuwa amewasaidia wananchi wengi ambao wana matatatizo yanayohusiana na ica hati za kumiliki mashamba.Jambo lingine Bw. Spika, ni kwamba sisi tuna sheria ya kuyachunga mashamba hayo. Kama kuna shamba ambalo halitumiwikwa njia inayofaa shamba hilo linapasa kuchukuliwa na kusimamiwa. au kuendeshwa na Serikali ili mazao yaweze kupatikana. Iwapo wananchi wataarifiwa mapema sioni ni kwa nini haw awe zi kuitumia nafasi hiyo na kuhakikisha kwamba mashamba hayo yanalimwa kwa manufaa na faida ya Xichi yetu. ITinasema hivi kwa sababu tunafahamu wazi kwamha idadi ya watu hunru. nchini imeongezeka sana na watu  hawa wote wanahitaji chakula cha kutosha. Kwa hivyo kama kuna mashamba ambayo hayatumiwi kwa wakati huu nafilcLri Serikali inayo haki ya kuingilia na kuona kwamba mashamba yamechukuliwa iliyaweze kutuniiwa vizuri ili nchi liii iweze kujitosheleza kwa vyakulana ksszixks mambo mengine ambayo yatasaidia katika kuimarisha uchumi wa nchi hiioJambo lingine ambalo linafaa kujadiliwa kati ya Waziri na Mkuu wa Sheria ni uamuzi wa s wazee kwenye kesi za sis mashambae Ninasema. hivi kwa sababu wazee wakishakata kHwarvj kauli shamba liende kwa mtu. fulani utaweza kuona kwamba yule mwingine anaipeleka kesi hiyo katika Mahakama Kuu Kesi hiyo itazidi kuvurugwa na ninafikiri halitakuwa jambo la maana lcutenda mambo tofauti baada ya Mtukufu Raisna Bunge hili kuamua kwamba yafaa wazee wa vijijini wapewe uwezo wa kuamua kesi. za mashamba ili amani iweze kudumue Wazee wengi hawajui kusoma wala lcuandilca na pengine hawafahamu kwamba mawakili huhitaji. kulipva pesa nyingi Irwenye kesi za ardhi [Mr. Speaker left the Chair] [The temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr.; Karauri) took the Chalry]Kwa hivyo, Bwo Naibu Spika wa a Mud a, ningependaWaziri ajaribu kushauriana na Mkuu wa Sheria kuhusu jambo hiliili kuona ni njia gani ambayo tunaweza kusuluhisha Turgor mxmigogoro ya a mashamba bila kuharibu wakati mwingi. kiwa wazeewametoa uamuzi ingefaa uamuzi wao uzingatiw.badala ya Irulpelekakesi kortini ambapo pesa nyingi  zitatumika Hili ni jamboambalo huifanya haki izungushwe na mwishowe Inrpfea kupotea.Jambo lingin.e ambalo ningependa kugasia ni kuhusuprivate land surveyors Hawa watu huwatoza wakulima pesa nyingi sana.Kama jambo hili linagharimu pesa nyingi namna hiyo sijui ni kwa nini Wizara hii hai?ezi kuongeza idadi ya surveyors wa Serikali ili kupunguza matatizo yanayowakabili wakulima wetu.

Ningeomba mipango ya kuchimba mabwawa ya maji ifanywe kwanza halafu majnbo ya kugawanya mashamba yafanywe baadayeIngawa iiamegawanya sehemu nyingi, kuna nyingine ambazo zimeachwa nyuina na ningeomba & Yaziri na maofisa wake wote wajaribu kumaliza kugawanya wilaya yote ya Narok Kwa mfano, mashamba katika lolcesheni za Loita na Mabera na. sehemu nyinginezo hayajapimwa. Katika mpaka va Yilaya ya Kajiado na ya Narok, kuna sehemu mcja ambayo imeachva bila kugawany.va na Ofisa waUgawanyaji wa Mashamba Bemafcation Officer wa Narok anafahamu hivyo iouQC na hata aae shahanl sha vz maofisa wake na hali kazi bado haijaansa. Wakati mmoja, walikuwa wakisema eti hawana ile nyororo ya kupiraa washamba. Hata kuna wakati mmoja nilipokwenda mpaka kwa ofisi ya Wizara nikitaka kumuona ofisa fulani lakini nikaambiwa ameshaondoka.Nataka waende wamalize kugawanya sehemu hiyo ambayo imeachwa haraka iwezekanavyo Lokesheni ya Narok North imewachwa bila kugawanywa na pia sehemu ya mpakani mwa wilaya ya Kajiado na Narok. Ni sehemu ndogo sana na watu wengi wanaishi humo lava sababu kuna maji 11a mi situ.Ni heri wajaribu kumaliza kazi hii haraka ili wananchi wapate mashamba kama wataamua kuvapa kila mtu shamba au katika vikundi vikundi ni sawa lakini yafaa wajaribu kuharakisha kazi hiiJambo lingine ni kuhxisu title deeds.Shamba likisha gawanywa, title deed kama vile SSi mhe. Nyaga" alivyosema huonyesha kwamba shamba ni lako kamili. Watu wengine huvamia shamba lako kwa nguvu na bila idhini yako. Hii ndiyo sababu ya lcuwa una kesi nyingi za mashamha kortini. Mtu mwingine anaharihu pesa za mwenye shamba na yeye hana halo. tea vile hana cheti chakuonyesha kwamba shamba hilo ni lake. Unaingia tu kuleteauswenye shamba hilo hasara. Hivyo nikuonyesha nini? Sijui kamaWizara ina .jambo lolote  linaloweza kufanywa kuwasaidia walewatu kuwaondoa watu walioingia huko tea nguvu. Sijui kama niMkuu wa Sheria ambaye anaweza kusaidia katika mambo kama haya.Tabia hii ni ya kupoteza pesa za watu wengine. Mwenye shambaana title deed na anjua vile ime and itea. Kwa nini mtu mwingineanaenda kimsumbua? Watu wengi wanatumia njia hii. Hatawengine wanayahama mashamba yao na kuja kulcusumbua bure.Hiyo ni kupoteza wakati na pesa za mtu m.vingine na kumzuia	asifanye kazi yake. Hilo si jambo lamaana. hata lddogo.Ningependa vrakat i Waziri atakapokuwa akijibu saf ajaribu kusema. nikva nlni kuna mambo hayo ya vvatu wengine kusumbua wenzao.Ni heri mambo haya yaangaliwe ili wenye mashamba waweze kuendesha kazi yao visuriKama ndiigu yangu amechukua tit deed ya shamba lake inayomaanisha shamba ni lake, basi aaachwealitumie atakavyo bila kusumbuliwa na vvatu wengine.Jambo lingine ni kvamba kama nilivyosema kuna sehemu nyingi scmm ambazo hasi jagavanyva na zimechelewa na hali vatu wanazidi kungojea. Hizo nikama sehemu zile nimetaja na kuna vvatu wa kufanya hiyo kazi, na ni vizuri waende wakafanye hio kazi. wanaweza pia kuwahesabu vatu na kuwaandika majina katika sehemu moja. Tungetaka wale vijana ambao wall tairi?. baada ya ardhi hii kupimwa, waandikishwe.Ikiwa hawataandik. kama watu wasio na ardhi, watakwenda wapi na baba zao wako katika ile group ranch; Kwa hivyo, tungetaka wale vijana vrote arabao wamekwisha tariwa. wasndikishwe ili watakapokuja kugawa mashamba, vijana hawa wafikiriwe kama watu wengine.Jambo lingine, Bw. Naibu Spika waMuda, ambalo ningetaka kutaja linahusuploti katika miji yetu. Katika miji yetu, kuna ploti nyingi anbazo zimetolewa namakonseli mbali mbali. Tunaona vile ploti hdi zinatolewa kwa wingi na sijui watoto vya nyuma watapata ploti kutoka wapi. Ikiwa ardhi yote sasa imechukuliwa na wale watu walioko sasa arabao wamepata hajrti za loimiliki ardhi hii3 wale watoto watakacPkuja baadaye watapata ardhi wapi? Hi lazima ardhi nyingine iachwe ili watoto wetubaada ya kumaliza shule. waweze kupata ardhi.Jambo lingine ni kwamba watu wengine wanatumia hatti za s kumiliki ardhi kwa kupata mikopoj lakini s wakati mwingine wanachukuia pesa nyingi zaidi kuliko dhamani ya an ardhi wanayomiliki. Hivyo ni kusema mtu zkxskrrkss akipatiwa mkopo halafu anautumia kwa njia isiyofaa, mwishowe anashindwa kulipa vile rakopo na shamba lake linauzwa. Kiaewaona watuwengi ambao mashamba yao yameuzwa kwa KEjz njia hii. Wakati mwingine unaona kwamba shamba linanadiwa kwa shs. 1 , au Shs.2,.Kunashamba la ekari 8 ambalo liliuzwa krca Shs.5,-bei ya ekari noja ya .ardhi ni kama Shs. 1,. Kwa hivyo, ingefaa kama wangekatasehemu ya shamba kama hilo na kuuza na kuinwacbia mwenye shamba ile sehemu nyingine. Sasa yule mwenye shamba la ekari 8 ameachva bila shambabaada ya shamba hilo kuuzwa na kulipalile : deni ktgo halafU aliyelinunua lile shamba akapata faida. Sasa yule maskini alibaki bila pahali pa kukaa na pengine atafaidika ikiwa atakuwa na ploti katika ile group ranch ambapo watu bado hawajagawiwa ardhiingawa wanaendeler. kuwalisha ngombe na mbuzi na kuweza, kuwalea watoto wao kule. Ikiwa yule, mtu  hakuwa mwanachama katika ile group ranch, basi angeachwa bila pahali pa lcuishi.Jambo lingine sktio ningetaka kutaja linaliusu barabara katika. sehemu za malisho ya ngombe. Tungetaka lcuwa na barabara nzuri, maji na vituo vya afyakatika sehemu zetu za malisho. Kama tungopata huduma hizi,	maendelco katika sehemu hizi. Tukiwa na barabara nzuri, watu wataweza kusafiri hapa na pale na watafaidika. Lakini leva wakati hiu, ikiva una gon na unataka Icumpelcka hospitalini, hutapata usaidizi kwa sababu hakuna barabara. Jambo Hili haliwezi kutusaidia hata kidogo ria wa,tu wengine vataendelea kuurcia. Kwa hivyo; ningevaomba maofisaa a Vfizara hii vanapo ifanya kazi yao, wafikirie kuwapatia watu we tu ma ji. Ikiwezekana wanaweza kuchimba raabwawa ya raaji au kutuletea raaji kutoka mtoni.

MUTISO: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I am sorry about this. I do not really want to take Kur time but since I knowmany hon.

We have a quorum now. Will you continue, Mr. Nyakiamo.</newspeech><newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LANDS AND SETTLEMENT(Mr. Nyakiamo): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to respond to the Motion. First of all, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the hon. Members of this House for the contributionswhich have been very well thought out. As I said in my opening speech yesterday,the land question in this country is very touchy and very important to	all of us. In my speech, I said that land is what we fought for during our struggle	for Independence and, therefore, the administration of land is very important,		particularly with regard to development. The question of administering the land	is of paramount importance, as far as the Government is concerned, and as one hon.			Member said yesterday, the Ministry of Lands and Settlement is a service Ministiy	which serves all the other Ministries. The Ministry of Local Government, when it	comes to building, always comes to us and so does the Ministry of Commerce,	Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Industry and others. Therefore, it is very	important to take a serious note of the points raised by the hon. Members for the	past two days.	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I accept that mistakes have beenmade through human error and at times through criminal offences. However, from what the hon. Members have said, in the past two days, we have learned a lot and it is for me and my officers to take a serious note of what has been said here.Not everybody has been bad and, therefore, credit must be given where it is due.It is for this reason that, I think, before I touch on the various points which have been raised by the hon. Members, and they are very many, I should make some clarifications.</newspeech> LNN	<newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LANDS AND SETTLEMENT (ctd.):Touching on title deeds, I would like to say that everyonewho owns a piece of land would like to have a title deed, and wecannot neglect anyone. This exerse is being accelerated,I did touch on some of the constraints the Ministryis faced with. We have already made representations to the Ministryof finance those to see that we are given funds. At the moment,we have 1.8 million title deeds which have been registered.The target is 2 million title deeds.	However, not all title deedshave been collected by their owners. As far as settlement scheme title deed owners are consented I would like it to be noted that there is noprovision under which land can be transferred to the settlers pendingÂ»payment of loans, we have to give them that security.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as far as landadjudication and consolidation is concerned, I would like tosay that there have been delays. We are going to see howwe can rectify these delays. But for the information of theHouse, I Would only like to clarify one thing. Two or threehon. Members were yesterday concerned about land consolidation,and I thought it better to clarify the issue. At the time, westarted land consolidation in places like Meru and inCentral Province indeed it is in the question of land consolidation in which we were to go over and see what pieces one has, consolidate them into one and then give the person an alternative piece of land somewhere else some people rightly said, "others have been given rocky land". Due to difficulties about this, a change was made; we no longer go by consolidation in all the new areas; we go by adjudication and demarcation. In that case, where a person has three pieces of land in three different places, he will get three title deeds for the three pieces of land. I wanted the House to note this.</newspeech><newspeech>THE MINISTER FR LANDS AND SETTLEMENT (ctd.):On the question of land adjudication system under the LandAdjudication Act, I thought I would read something to the House.What do we do when we declare a place an adjudication section?When this is declared, the adjudication officer appoints a landadjudication committee consisting of not less than 1 elders,resident within the adjudication section. This committee is thefirst adjudication tribunal, charged with the duty of hearing anddetermining land disputes, brought before it during the demarcationprocess. Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I run through this	quickly so that we can know what happens.Where disputes arise, these are heard and decided	upon by the committee. Any person aggrieved by its decision	has the right to appeal to the arbitration board. The second	adjudication tribunal consists of not less than five elders,	resident within the district. The right must be exercised within a period of 14 days from the date of the committees decision. When the process of demarcation, recording and surveying of land has been completed in the section, and all the cases before the committee and the board have been heard and determined, and the adjudication record containing the details of ownership has been compiled, the adjudication officer will display the original adjudication register for inspection by land owners at a convenient place within the disputing section, and give notice that the	adjudication register has been completed and may be inspected at the place during a period of 6 days from the date of notice. This is important because a lot of people do not go by that.	Any person who considers the register to ii be incorrect	or incomplete in any respect, may then lodge Ms written objection to the adjudication officer within that period, and the officer will hear and determine such objection in his capacity as the as the hard adjudication hibernal 	<newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LANDS AND SEITLEMENT (ctd.):Any person aggrieved by his decision has the right to appeal to the Minister for Lands and Settlement who is the fourth and final adjudication tribunal. I say this so that at least, the matter is clarified in the minds of the hon. Hembers and the country as a whole.The hearing of the committee, the board and the objection cases take time and depending on the number of such cases filed in the adjudication section, delay is bound to occur. So, the quicker the disputes are handled, the quicker the matter is completed, and the quicker the title deeds can be given.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, another point that was raised was on land disputes, boundaries and so forth. When such things occur, we should send our officer quickly to the field to see that the matter is settled. I accept that. However, I would like to make it known to the House that the Government has already amended the Magistrates Act to facilitate resolving land ownership disputes. It is current Government policy that land ownership disputes should be first referred to elders by courts, through the district commissioners, who should be the chairmen of elders tribunals.Since the district commissioners could not personally attend to all cases referred to them, they delegate this Â£e responsibility to their district officers, who may have, in turn, over delegated to their chiefs and assistant chiefs. I take the point raised by the hon. Members that sometimes, this leaves a lot to be desired. I have talked to my officers and toldthem that this delegation is not over delegated.The third point which was raised was about surveyors, both licensed and unlicensed. With the recent amendment to the Survey Act, there are sufficent provisions now to facilitate the licensing of more land surveyors. The machinery is already.</newspeech><newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LANDS AND SETTLEMENT (ctd.):set towards this achievement and the Government does not recognise the work of bogus surveyors, as some hon. Members said.But an hon. Member here who used to be the director of surveys spoke very well here yesterday and said, âthis House passed an Act controlling the fees that can be charged by surveyors". I agree that it is cheaper to deal with Government surveyors, and where possible we should use them, but then, our licensed surveyors are qualified; they are also in business, but they should not charge anything above what has been set by the Government.The third point is on sectional title deeds. I did mention this in my speech and I said that the Sectional Titles Bill has already been published to provide for the registration of sectional titles and, in fact, it has already been laid on the Table.The fifth point is on physical planning in markets, trading centres and towns. I agree that the mushrooming of buildings in these areas n should be controlled. It is time that the Planning Section of the Ministry of works, Housing and Physical Planning should put their heads together and liaise with us and the Ministry of Local Government to see that these is planned. I accept this. The Ministry does not consider this to be a major problem because I feel we can control it and particularly using the District Focus for Rural Development Strategy..Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have already touched on the speeding up of land consolidation and adjudication, but I would like to say that the Government took remedial measures by appointing special district commissioners to help in this matter. The Ministry is reviewing the situation so that a work programme is drawn with target dates for completing the various tasks involveu so as to finish the matter of cases. I repeat here that a chief has no direct role to play in land adjudication proceedings. It </newspeech><newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LANDS AND SETTLEMENT (ctd.):  for the adjudication officer on the spot to do that. The chief and the district officer are there to see that law and order is maintained. </newspeech>JMK<newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LANDS AND SETTLEMENT (ctd.):We have already recommended amendments to the Land Adjudication Act to provide forland adjudication officers to sit with the panel of elders so that the elders donot hear objection cases alone. This will help to speed up matters.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, point number seven, is on accelerationof land adjudication programme. It is our intention that this should be acceleraÂ¬ted and, as I have said, we will do so.	Sir, the question of squatters was raised here, and I would like to takethis opportunity to say that it is high time, as a certain hon. Membersaid here, that land in Kenya cannot go round. We are now about 2 million in Kenya,and if someone says that each Kenyan will have a piece of land, he is telling alie. So, we should be satisfied with whatever pieces of land we have.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. SHIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Ithink it was a slip of the tongue on the part of the Minister. He used the word"lie", a language that is not Parliamentary. He should have used the word "untruth".</newspeech><newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LANDS AND SETTLEMENT (Mr. Nyakiamo): Mr. TemporaryDeputy Speaker, Sir, I take the point. I should have said that it would be untruefor anyone to say that each Kenyan will get a piece of land. However if the hon.Member just wanted me to use Parliamentary language, I think he is satisfied.Sir, as I was going to say before that interruption, the question ofsquatters is a problem, although sometimes we ourselves make it so. It is time thepeople of Kenya realised that ones piece of land is ones piece of land and youcannot go to squatter on somebodys land in order to force the Government to giveyou land elsewhere. I said this at the Coast Province and I will repeat it here.Anyone who is really landless, as long as the Ministry of Lands and Settlement isthere, is free to apply for settlement and if we can assist we will do so. If we cannot assist him, then we tell him we are not able. There is no point going to squatter on Government land or someone elses lend with the hope that you will force the Government to give you land. We shall not allow that. <newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LANDS AND SETTLEMENT (ctd.):Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the question of land allocation wasalso raised by several hon. Members. There is a procedure for allocation of landin urban and e rural areas, and priority is to be given to indigenous Kenyans.Where a plot is required for public utility, the request is given priority. Butthen, it is up to us, as Kenyans, when we are in position, to exercise the neededintegrity.	My point number 1, Sir, is the question of ceiling of land ownershipwhich was also raised during the debate. I am not competent to speak on thatissue and, therefore, I will leave it to the House. At the moment we shall go bythe laws that are in our books. I am not going to comment on the issue presently.However, as regards agricultural land, the land control boards can refuse consentwhere they consider that a purchaser has sufficient land or where they considerthat the purchase is against the interests of the country.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there was a point raised yesterday about having as many land registries as possible, and I would like to inform the House that we have 28 land registries. There are 27 of them in the districts and one in Nairobi. In the Coast Province, we have land registries in Taita, Moabasa, Kilifi and Kwale. In Eastern Province, land registries are located in Machakos, Kitui, Embu and Keru districts. With regard to Central Province, we have land registries in Kirinyaga, Muranga, Kiarabu, Nyandarua and Nyeri districts, lie have land registries in Eyanza Province located in Kisumu, Kisii, South Eyansa and Siaya districts. In Western Province, land registries axe located in Kakamega, Bungoma and Busia districts. There are land registries in Nakuru, Kajiado, ITarok, Kericho,. Uasin Gishu, Barindo and Kandi districts in Rift Valley Province. The last one, which is the Central Land Registry, is situated in Nairobi. I do take the point suggested by hon. Members that where possible we should spread land registries in the whole Republic. It is our policy to do so, and the Ministry will open more land registries as and when the volume of work in a district warrants it.</newspeech><newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LANDS AND SETTLEMENT (ctd.):ISir, the twelfth point that-was raised and to which I would like to address myself is in connexion with allowances for members of land control boards. I am pleased to say that the allowances for land control board members have been increased. Allowances payable to members of district land control boards stand at KShs.3- per sitting per member.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. MWARUWA: Only?</newspeech>	<newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LANDS A1TD SETTLEMENT (Mr. Nyakiamo): Yes, only that.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other point that was raised is in connexion with trust land. Some hon. Members felt that trust land within county councils may be open to abuse from time to time. I am not an expert on this and I do not know much about the abuse, but the procedure which is intended to protect the interests of the public who reside on such land is there. Therefore the chances of county councils abusing the trust land are minimal, particularly where district commissioners sit at district development committees. Indeed, hon. Members of this House are automatically members of the district developmentcommittees.Sir, I have already touched on the question of professional fees charged by surveyors, and I said that there is an Act of Parliament governing this matter. The question of group ranches was also raised here, and I am happy to inform the House that we are preparing a Cabinet Paper for consideration on this subject.Regarding land laws, I am pleased to tell this House that recommendations have already been made to the Law Reform Commission for see consideration.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member for Yatta spoke very eloquently yesterday and very seriously, and I think he thinks fax he has been forgotten entirely. He even saw me this afternoon and told me that while I touched on all other districts about settlement schemes, I forgot to say something about Yatta. I have taken note of what he has told me, and I have confirmed to have that my officers and I are prepared to go to Yatta and hold a baraza with the Machakos District Commissioner to hear what the problems of the people of Yatta are.</newspeech><newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LANDS AND SETTLEMENT (ctd.):The seventeenth point that I want to reply to is the change, rotationand transfer of officers. In order not to allow officers to be attached to particular areas and become part and parcel of those areas, I am sure that my Permanent Secretary will act on this matter. We should not leave an officer to work in one place for 15 years. I agree that that is too long a period and, in fact, I must say that there have been some accusations of some bad things. Anything to prevent that will have to be done.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, one hon. Member said that there isa place in Wajir and Koyale where our officers are doing nothing. I accept that we are short of equipment but, as I have already said, presentations have already been made through the Ministry of Finance to get us assistance from Japan in order to equip our people.On the question of settlement, I recall that hon. Khalif said that there appears to be some discrimination as far as settling people is concerned, something that I do not accept. </newspeech>		 ART		<newspeech>THE MINISTER FOR LANDS AND SETTLEMENT (Contd.):Anyone can apply to my Ministry to be settled, and we do not ask where he comes from. At the moment, we have the Magarini Settlement Scheme going on in Malindi. This is where, as I said yesterday we are giving 3 acres per family, and that we have already settled 1,26 families. We have yet to reach 4, families and over. If hon. Khalif wants to bring some people from his area, they are at liberty to apply. Sir, I think I have already touched on most of the points that have been raised. But may I take this opportunity, also, to say again that I have taken seriously the matters which have been raised here, or the points which have been made by the hon. Members, and considering the sensitivity of the land problems, I and my officers will take care. We will do our job as honestly, and as quickly as we can.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the Motion.

ANGATIA: Thank you very Much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir,for giving me this opportunity to also make my remarks on this very importantMotion. This Motion has enlightened us on a lot of things and I would like tostart by thanking His Excellency the President for the steps he is taken at the moment. If only institutions. which are charged with the responsibility of collectingand looking after our money and making more money, were doing their job properly,we would be having twice as much money as we have today. Mr. Temporary DeputySpeaker, Sir, is that not a great statement for this country. The President has  come up and said that those who are charged with the responsibility of collecting  the money, keeping it and making sure that it multiplies, have not done their job. If they had done their job properly, then we would be having as twice as much money as we have in this country at the moment.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this Motion is talking about money.	sweating to take out money to pay other people outside this country. I am not sayingThe President has gone as far as talking about the money that comes into the country, and the money that goes outside the country. We all know what is going on at the moment, and there could not be a better time to talk about borrowing than a time when the President is telling us that more money is going out of Kenya today than is coming in. However, the fact is that we are net exporters of capital and not net importers of capital, which means that as days go by, all our labour and production, and everything else, is going towards paying back the man who has made money in Europe and has been lending it to our country. Perhaps thisman is living at the coast of Greece, or in the West Indies, enjoying himself there.		However, here in the country, we are sweating to keep him alive or to keep him enjoyingwherever he is whether in the West Indies or in the Mediterranean. Kenyans; arethat it is wrong to borrow. We are supposed to have borrowed and made enoughmoney out of that borrowing, so that we can also be able to live confortably and be		able to repay that gentleman his money. 	What happened, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, is that when we borrowed and planned on how to multiply that money so that we can also enjoy ourselves asmuch as that gentleman who lent us the money, we ended up sweating day and night		trying to make enough  money to pay for that persons pleasure. Consequently,	 instead of going up economically, we have gone down. The President pointed outthat this is purely a question of management and integrity. The zsadbe people who	have been charged with the responsibility of looking after our money and. making	_	sure that it multiplies and that it is safe, have not done their jobs as		they ought to have done. This is not a small issue and, therefore, we ought, as a	House, to indicate our concern about it. We must be grateful to id Hon. Shikuku the watchman	or whatever other names you may call him because he has been able to see these things and	has brought this Motion to this House. This is not so that we may stop the Kenya PortsAuthority from developing, but so that, we can sit down and ask ourselves whether the money we have borrowed is justifiable or whether the investments we have madeare justifiable. At a time when the Kenya Ports Authority is just about to invest,		it is the proper time for it to sit down and ask itself the question whether it	"	is justified in that investment. We are not saying that the Kenya Ports Authority </newspeech><newspeech>MR. ANGATIA (Ctd.)	should not invest. In any case, the Kenya Ports Authority should not feel regretful. In fact, it should feel happy that the National Assembly has focused its attention 	on its activities, but has it done its job properly. If it has done its job properly,this House is responsible enough to say, "thank you". However, if it has not done its job properly, this douse is responsible enough to say, "No, it should do it better. Therefore, Sir, let nobody in the Front Bench, or anywhere else fool that the issues which are being raised here are intended to question the integrity, the seriousness, the honesty or the sincerity of the people who want to borrow this moneyto do a job. No, this is being done so as to find out whether the Kenya Ports Authority has been doing its job properly. If you combine the eefforts of this House in finding out these things, and what His Excellency the President is saying, what else does anyone need to do his job properly?Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is also the question of the Kenya Ports Authority having done a good job. Therefore, where as I have made those remarks questioning what the Kenya Ports Authority has done on the one hand, let us alsoappreciate that it has done its job well on the other hand. I am saying this because when other parastatals bodies have been losing money, the Kenya Ports Authority has been making money. We have parastatals like .the National Cereals and Produce Board, the Kenya Railways Corporation, the Kenya Airways which we are well known for losing money and there are very many others in this a category, When Mr. Shikuku was moving this Motion, he gave us a whole list of institutions which borrowed money which was guaranteed by the Government of this country; but that money got lost, lids is a time to stop and ask ourselves: are we making a mistake by guaranteeing this money to the Kenya Ports Authority or are we doing the right thing?	Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this brings in another question. If the Kenya Ports Authority has enough money to invest The hon. Member who spoke before me misled this House as he was referring to records which were turned upside down, and he made remarks which were unnecessary. What we are saying is that the Kenya Ports Authority has done a good job but it could do even a much better job; otherwise, the President could not have said what he said last night.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. ANGATIA (Ctd.):	The Kenya Ports Authority has done well so far and we want  it to do even better.  It even	money of it own to invest. If this Authority is borrowing money at a very low interest and very it has invested it own money at a very high rateof interest the net result y when you put two and two together is that the Kenya  Ports Authority will eventually receive a very high, income, and that is a good job.However, this Sessional Paper does not say that. It does not say that what theKenya Ports Authority has invested will earn much more than what we shall pay outas interest on what we are going to borrow. At a  time when we are talking about agreat outflow of money out of .the country: and very little money 6ming in, whatsense is there in allowing somebody who already has the money to go and borrow somemore money from outside? If it is a question of trading with money, the Central .Bank of Kenya can do a better job than the Kenya Ports Authority. What right do wehave of giving the Kenya Porte Authority another job of trading with money in thiscountry?</newspeech>	-<newspeech>THE ASSISTAET MINISTER FOR CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES (Mr. Michuki):On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is it right for the hon. Member to give this house information which is not correct by saying that we are equating theKenya shilling with foreign currency in a transaction which is international. Is hein order to give us the impression that money in any form is money. Money is very different. Kenya shilling is the Kenya currency and there is also the dollar, the Swiss franc and so on. So, the hon. Member should make it clear as to what point he is trying to raise. </newspeech>		<newspeech>MR. AEGATIA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, are you really satisfied	that that  point or order is genuine to take my time?  That is not a point oforder. I am not talking about Swiss francs dollars and so on. I am talking about the Kenya shilling and we are borrowing this money at an equivalent amount of Slis.l88 million. This is what we are talking about and I said it very clearly. The hon. Assistant Minister was trying to raise a point of order which did not get off the ground. He is a financier and knows very well that I am saying that if the Kenya Ports Authority is borrowing money at a very low rate of interest, so that in the end they will have made money on that business of making money, then that make sense.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. AKGATIA (Ctd.):But what I am saving is that the Central Bank of Kenya is well placed to do that kind of job than the Kenya Ports Authority, and I would expect him to inform me about that. However, instead, he was just wasting our time by going off the point. Anyway, Sir, I will carry on.</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. ANGATIA (ctd.):The work that is supposed to be done, as hon. Martin Shikuku told us, is very important.</newspeech><newspeech>TED ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR TOURISTS AIID WILDLIFE (Mr. Njuno): On a point or of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Was it in order for hon. Angatia to say that hon. Michuki was "wasting time" when, in fact, he was on a point of order? We do not waste time in this House.</newspeech><newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Karauri): Hon. Angatia, that is out  of order, An hon.

AKGATIA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, what was the value ofthe time he took? Was it worth, anything?</newspeech><newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. KARAURI): Hon. Angatia, the phrase "wasting time" is not acceptable in this House. The hon. Member may have taken your time but, certainly, he did not waste time.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. ANGATIA: Okay, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I accept your ruling and carry on </newspeech><newspeech>HON. MEMBERS: Withdraw. Withdraw! And  apologise!</newspeech><newspeech>MR. ANGATIA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, if the job that is supposedto be done is as important as hon. Martin Shikuku has told us and as the Kenyaports Authority itself has stated </newspeech><newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Karauri): Order, hon. Angatia. Will you withdraw the phrase "waste of time?"</newspeech><newspeech>MR.  AHGATIA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am not aware of any problem here.</newspeech><newspeech>HON.

Withdraw that remark!</newspeech>		<newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Karauri): Order, hon. Members. Hon. Angatia, it is just a question of withdrawing the remark because our Standing Orders provide that the-re is nothing like wasting of time by an hon. Member when he is contributing to debate in this House. So, withdraw that remark.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. AK GAT I A: I agree with you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I withdraw the remark about wasting time and inform hon. Michuki that next time he should make it of greater value that it was. </newspeech>	(Laughter) <newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR CULTURE AND SOCIAL SERVICES (Mr. Michuki): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I am seeking your guidance as to whether whatever the hon. Member has said amounts to withdrawal of his remark and an apology.</newspeech><newspeech>MR. ASGATIA: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have withdrawn the remark that the Assistant Minister was wasing time because you have guided me that we do not waste time in this House. In this house, we do not waste time here. I have already withdraw that remark. Do I still have any debt? Do I owe anybodyanything?	I have already offered my appreciation for the work that is going to be done with this money, and it may be important and urgent. It may be so urgent that perhaps we should look at this matter quickly and let the Kenya Ports Authority get on with the job immediately. That work being so necessary,  can the Kenya Ports Authority not use the money which they already have and carry on with it?Sir, another point that I would like to touch on, and which was raised by hon. Shilruku when he was moving this Motion.</newspeech> (The amber light flashed)<newspeech> MR. SHIKUKU: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir.I thought I saw the amber light flash.  I think that was a mistake and, therefore,the hon. Member speaking should not worry about the time. This is a Government Motion and an hon. Member can speak for as long as he wishes.</newspeech> <newspeech>MR. ANGATIA: Thank you very much, hon. Shikuku. Sir, hon. Martin Shikukutold us that when the port area was constructed, it was decided that about KShs.4million would be set aside every year  under the name of depreciation money  forrepairs, renovations and improvement of the port. So, we would like the Minister,when  comes to reply to this Motion, to tell us whether that amount of money hasbeen kept aside every ye from 1952. If that was happening, was the moneyinvested somewhere in order to earn some interest or was it not set aside for!depreciation when the port continued to get bad such that there is now no moneyfor renovating the port area? This is very important because, whether we arebuilding Mumias Sugar Factory, whether we are braiding a railway station or whetherwe are putting up a Kenya Ports Authority, an area which is going to be used andwhich is subject to serious tare and wear, we have to set aside some money called depreciation money for renovations and improvements. If this was done, we would like to know where the money is now that the Kenya Ports Authority is being forced to go and borrow very expensive money from Europe. I submit that this is very expensive money, considering the remark I. made earlier that more money is going out than is coming in.Sir, another point that I would like to point out to the Minister for Finance that we will guarantee loans and we should actually do that. We will also borrow money from outside, and we should do that bearing in mind that that money we are km borrowing is to help us make more money for the comfort of our people, to increase the wealth of this country and to try and distribute it as fairly as possible. That is granted and there is no quarrel about it. We should, however, be careful when we are going to borrow this money. Are we going to use the loans to generate more money? Do we really net have any other money of our own? Borrowing and guaranteeing loans is something that we are going to continue doing, and this Motion offers us a chance to look back at the whole process and to ask ourselves a few questions. When we say that we are taking out more money than we are bringing in, we are offering a challenge to the Ministry of Finance and to all </newspeech><newspeech>MR. ANGATIA (ctd.) parastatal organisations. We are also offering a challenge to even individuals. If there are individuals who have taken money outside this country and they have helped to run down the welfare of this country and yet they v.7ant to share with" us the little that they have left in this country, those individuals should be prosecuted seriously. We are appealing to the Minister for Finance and the Central Bank that if these people are known, we should do something about it so that our country can recover its wealth and continue growing the ss. way it is supposed to be growing.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, population increase is hitting us because it is a factor of development. When people are developed, they will not mind about population growth. When people are aware of the state of development in their minds and also in their own welfare, they will not mind about population growth. When people know that if you keep Mairobi City clean then they will enjoy themselves and that if you keep Nairobi .with fewer people you will be able to the parks here and enjoy themselves, they will appreciate that. It is only when the people are aware of the state of development that they can control population â¢growth. But when the people know that the wealthy ones have taken money outside this country and, therefore, they have no chance of increasing their wealth and enjoying themselves, we cannot call ourselves developing and we cannot control population growth.Sir, one of the biggest problems we are having today is unemployment. This is a most worrying issue; it worries hon. Members of Parliament at individual level; it is worrying the whole country and it is worrying employers. I am sure that the problem is also worrying those who are responsible for looking after our money. If money is going out and if these parastatals are losing money, it means that we are not croating jobs. It also means that the money in our pocket is not growing, Instead of doing a service to this country, those people who are taking money away ore undermining the country. You cannot have any great traitor today than that one who takes money outside Kenya when we direly need that money </newspeech><newspeech>MR. AHCATIA (ctd. ):ourselves. If those people are known, then they should be called the names I am calling them and they should be told that they are undercutting the countrys growth. They are, in fact, traitors and action should be taken against them.Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I would like to end by appealing to the Minister for Finance, when he comes to reply, to tell us exactly what happenedto the depreciation money that was supposed to be set aside for renovating the portarea. I would also like him to tell us whether it is true that we are losing moremoney  than we are bringing into the country. I am also appealing to theMinister to go more for grants. I cannot confirm this, but I understand that inthis country there are so many people who approach the Treasury, the Ministry ofAgriculture, the Ministry of Labour and others, asking what we would like them todo for us. I understand that they want to set programmes for us. They have cometelling those Ministries that they have experts waiting with money and asking themwhether we  can allow them to invest the money here. Those people with themoney do not like projects e which fall under the Ministry of  Water  Development and the Ministry of Agriculture very much, but they like doing feasibility studiesand starting projects like Ken-Ren and so on because, in those areas, severalmillions of shillings pass through without us knowing. If there are people likethis, then we should ask ourselves whether whatever they want to do is he reallyin our interest. Can a European fly all the way from Europe to come here and knockon  the doors of our permanent secretaries and Ministers to persuade them toborrow some money when it is in our interest? It cannot be so.	With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg tosupport the Motion.</newspeech><newspeech>THE ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES (Mr. Nassir): Bw.

It implies that he is biased" on some individuals and that this Motion is after certain individuals whose .names he has not mentioned. Is that what he is implying?</newspeech><newspeech>THE TEMPORARY DEKJTY SPEAKER (Mr. Karauri): Well, I do not know whether that is the impression everybody got.</newspeech>	<newspeech>THE VICE-PRESIDENT  AND MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. Kibaki) Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise to oppose this Motion. The matters that are being brought in axe obviously extraneous. The Kenya Forts Authority deserves to be congratulated, and I stand up here to congratulate it.Secondly the fact that the Authority has some surplus is  already acknowledged by the format in this Sessional Paper, namely that slightly more than 5 per cent of this project will be financed from the resources of the Kenya Ports Authority itself. More imporatant is that up to this moment, all the previous borrowings are financed by the Kenya Ports Authority itself, and that what we are borrowing, the KSh.93 million, is purely to enable us to import capital. We, as hon. Members of this House, know the fact that we shall have to import capital and that even if we are using our own money, we will have to acquire foreign exchange; We will have to change our own money into that foreign exchange.(applause)And if we can acquire that foreign exchange through a small loan from the European Investment Bank, which costs only 5per cent,wananchi will get such a long period for repayment three yearsmoratorium. Those are the best terms we can have.The Kenya Ports Authority has many other jobs to dowith those other surpluses it has. Therefore, what we are askingfor is not unreasonable. I cannot allow myself to be persuadedthat there is anything unreasonable; there is none. In fact, itis a very sensible thing. At this moment, the Kenya Ports Authorityshould grow, not merely in order to remain competitive but more fundamentally, in order to serve the Kenyan economy more efficiently and more effectively, and additionally in order to serve the other nations like Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and Sudan.</newspeech><newspeech>THE VICE PRESIDENT AID MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS (ctd.): which use the Port of Mombasa, and will continue to use it. So, this loan is obviously needed.If one wants to raise issues on where the Kenya Ports Authority should be improved on, surely, you cannot say that you must cut your finger so as to spite your hand or cut off your nose in order to spite your face.(applause) That famous Englishman who tried it obviously looked more ugly.It is not important. The Kenya Ports Authority needs to Develop in this particular project. We are persuaded; it iswell described. New constructions and rehabilitation et cetera is needed on berths No. 11, 12, 13, as and 14 because ofand recovery is needed. It must be done urgently. So, that isa necessary development. Therefore, if  we have arguments that something else should be done to improve the Kenya Ports Authority further, we must say so, by all means 9 but let us divorce it from questions of personalities.	This motion has to do with projects, by all means.</newspeech><newspeech>Mr. ABUYA-ABUYA: On a point of order, Mir.
