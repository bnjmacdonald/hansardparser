 <Header>POINT OF ORDER</Header><Header> CALLING FOR A MINISTERIAL STATEMENT ON CHILDRENS CONTRACEPTIVES </Header><Newspeech> Dr. Mango: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker .Sir. My point Of order is based on an article on the front page of the Sunday Nation of 8th December, 1985, entitled "TenYear Olds To Get Contraceptives." Many parents in Kenya, are worried as to how these contra¬ceptives are going to be administered and whether it is actually true whether to worry about food for children, uniforms, school fees or contraceptives themselves. One of the many reasons why there is a lot of fear is that a lot of propaganda has been generated from foreign countries and lots of money seems to have been poured into this country as ail experimental country as a guinea pig for family planning methods. I myself believe in family planning and in cutting down the population growth rate.I am sure that many Members of this hon. House as well as the public outside would like to see that is so. But there should not be so much panic and cur population growth rate should not be used as a scapegoat for not planning properly. We are still a very large country and the employment problem is not that alarming. If we go to the extent of dishing out contra¬ceptives to tenyear olds, we are eroding our morality Mr. Speaker. Sir, our morality is based on our cul¬ture. We have a Ministry of Culture and Social Services, but they seem to have shunned their responsi¬bility. Culture in OUR case does not mean painting our faces during holidays and putting feathers on our heads and dancing: that is not culture. The central point, in our culture is moral; upholding our morals. Morals should come first. The morals are based, first of all, on the parents, teachers and social workers looking after our children not contraceptives to come first before the parents are given an opportunity to do some¬thing. I would like the Minister responsible for family planning and I think it is His Excellency the Vice President and Minister for Home Affairs to make a. Ministerial Statement to cool down Kenyans" fears. Thank you. </Newspeech > <Newspeech>Mr. Shikuku: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. My point of order is also regarding that matter. I thought I was trying to raise it but he has put it in a different style. I think this is a matter of serious nature, and we as legislators </Newspeech> <Newspeech> Mr. Speaker: Mr. Shikuku, we are not debating this issue. Dr. Mango has asked the Minister sometimes to make a statement. So we are not going to allow a debate as a follow up of this matter. What we are waiting for is what The Minister intends to do and that is all. </Newspeech> <Newspeech> Mr. Shikuku: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir </NEWSPEECH><Newspeech>Mr. Speaker :  No We are not going to make it at this stage The Minister concerned is not here but he will get the message anyway. Next Order. </NEWSPEECH><Header>BILLS</Header><Header>THE STATUTE LAW (MISCELLANEOUS AMENDMENTS) BILL</Header><Header> THE PENSIONS LAWS (AMENDMENT)  BILL</Header>                                                         <i>(Orders for First Readings readRead the First TimeOrdered lo be read the Second Time Today by leave of Like House) </i><i>Second Reading</i><Header>THE STATUTE LAW (MISCELLANEOUS AMENDMENTS) BILL</Header> <Newspeech>The AttorneyGeneral (Mr. Muli) :Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to move that the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill be now read a Second Time. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it has almost become a tradition in recent years that we round off our legislative pro¬gramme as it were, with a Bill consisting of miscellaneous amendments to our Statute Law. This year is no excep¬tion and the amendments proposed in the Bill are a number of minor matter which should not justify occupying the time of Parliament in separate Bills of their own. Each amendment is explained in depth in the Memorandum of Objects and Reasons attached to the Bill. Except where it is selfexplanatory or formal, I shall not detain hon. Members by repeating them all. But 1 should like to mention some of them.Mr. Speaker Sir I start with the Advocates Act. It is regrettable that professional misconduct by advocates is continuing to grow and this has become apparent and it has given His Excellency the President and this house concern. To illustrate what i am saying. I am sorry to tell  Hon Members that between August, 1983 and April 1985, over  60 advocates appeared before tse Disciplinary Committee for serious  breaches of professional  conduct. Of these, seven were struck off the roll of advocates, four were suspended from practising and 24 were fined and a few are in jail. This year alone, there have been a further 50 cases, heard by Disciplinary Committee, as a result of advocates not keeping proper accounts and books for the funds held by them for their clients. The Disciplinary Com¬mittee and the Attorney General have been even more concerned and worried to discover that some of the ad¬vocates who have committed such misconduct have been suspended from the roll of advocates by the Disci¬plinary Committee, have been exploiting a loophole in the Advocates Act by appealing to the high court against the order of the Disciplinary Committee and delaying in proceding with the appeal regardless of whether or not it has any merit. These advocates have been able to continue in practice and to appear in court notwithstanding that they have been suspended or disciplined by the Disciplinary Committee. This is clearly against the public interest and the amendments proposed to the. Advocates act are intended to give the Act proper teeth to stop this from happening.Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Government is determined to make sure that Kenyans who are in privileged position as a result of all the professional qualification they hold, shall not abuse the trust placed on them by wananchi who put their money or their affairs in the hands of these professionals. Because of the complexity of the work which She professional people do, their clients cannot make informed judgment on that work and the professionals must at all times be absolutely scrupulous in their dealing with clients Any departure from this standard must be dealt with seriously. Mr. Speaker, Sir, that goes as far as the Advocates Act is concerned. On page 281 of of the Bill the amendment seeks to amend sections 64 and 70 in order to stop any advocates practising while an appeal is pending before the high court.Now, Sir, the next one which I will deal with as the Civil Procedure Act. With our present inflation, an anomaly has arisen as a result of the way in which the Civil Procedure Act has  been framed. The count on award interest on principal sums at such rate as it deems reasonable under section 26 (1), but is restricted to a rate not exceeding 6 per cent per annum on awards of costs. In the light of the current interest rates pre¬vailing throughout the institutions, this discrepancy should not be allowed to continue and the amend¬ment will allow interest up to 12 per cent on costs after the court has given the award.So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the same page, that is 281, the amendment seeks to delete the words  "6 per cent per annum" and substituting in the place thereof, the words, "12 per cent per annum".Mr. Speaker, Sir, the next one is the Criminal Pro¬cedure Code. Earlier this year, the high court consisting of the then Chief Justice and two other judges, decided that the provision in section 123 of the Criminal Pro¬cedure Code which limited the rights of the high court to grant (bail in causes of murder, arson, robbery with violence or attempted robbery with violence, was inconsistent with section 72 (5) of our Constitution which protects a person’s life and accordingly, .the words concerned in section 123 of the Criminal Procedure Code were void. At the same time should add that the high court pointed out that bail, as a general rule, should not be granted when the offence charged carries a mandatory death penalty because of the great temptation to abscond. There is also an amendment for pro¬vision in which the court has found some inconsistency between the Criminal Procedure Code which is subject for a substantive law of  the land, that was, the constitution To that effect the amendment is being brought here before this House to amend that provision.The law of Succession Act is another on which allows to register a trust so as to obtain the benefits of continuity by incorporation as a body corporate, thus saving repealed documentation for transfers of assets whenever there is a change of trustees. Due to the manner in which the  Act was drafted  it was noli open to the trustees of pension  funds to take advantage of its provisions and the proposed amendment will make this possible. For consistency the definition of pension fund follows that in the recent Perpetuities and Ac-cumulations Act of 1984. Section 3 of the Pensions (Increase) Act has been found to be inconsistent with the Government policy. Therefore, from 1st July, 1977,  no government pension should be less than an £60 per annum. It is, therefore, to be amended to make that clear and as the amendment will be to the benefit of the pensioner it is right and proper that it should be back dated to 1st July. 1977.The other further amendment in the same field is made to the Local Authorities Provident Fund to for¬malise the position of the board as a consequence of the accusation of the Local Government Staff Commission, Who were ex OFFICIO members. As a new board, we will, however, in substance have the same composi¬tion. A further amendment to the Act is to make it change the amount which contributions to the fund are changed for reason which are  complicated they are just explained but which are set out in detail in the memorandum attached to the Bill. The change will bene¬fit employees by allowing them to contribute to the cash amount and so add to their savings if their contribution are being mentioned by identical contribution from the local authorities.The changes proposed to the Companies Act will allow those dealing with limited companies to find out from the companies register of all the charges created over their property by the companies, including and this is what the amendment involves charges over land registered under the Registered Land Act, which may, indeed, be the most substantial charges. In as much as we should make commercial land into limited companies in the long run, it will be an aid to develop it.Mr. Speaker, Sir, as hon. Members will have gathered, many of ,the amendments proposed in this Bill are for the direct and indirect benefit to the people of this country and, I therefore, commend it to them that they will do a useful job in tidying and tying up several loose legislative Acts. I ask them to support the amendmentsWith these few words, Mr. Speaker, I beg to move. </NEWSPEECH><Newspeech> The Minister for National Development and Planning (Dr. Ouko: Mr. Speaker, I beg to second the Bill. As the AttorneyGeneral has stated in his introductory remarks, the purpose of the Bill is to tidy up various Acts to incorporate measures intended to benefit wananchi. The remark I want to make in addition to the ones made by .the AttorneyGeneral is to thank the Law Society of Kenya for the vigilance with which they have looked after the interest of the ordinary person by summoning lawyers who have wronged the ordinary mwananchi  to their Disciplinary Committee and for being instrumental in suspending such lawyers or having their cases taken to court. As the AttorneyGeneral has said, a number of these lawyers are serving jail sentences for crimes against their clients. We thank the society and ask them to continue this vigilance. The other part which the hon. AttorneyGeneral did not refer to is the Provident Fund Act which seeks it enable the funds contributed by former Kenyan employees of the General Fund Services of the East African Community into the East African Community Pension Fund to be put into the Kenyan Pension Fund and to make it possible for these Kenyans who are now back in Kenya and serving their Government to with¬draw their provident fund benefits from the Kenya Pension Fund.With those remarks, Mr. Speaker, I beg to second.</NEWSPEECH><i>(Question proposed)</i><NEWSPEECH>The Minister for Works, Housing and Physical Plan¬ning (Mr. Wanjgi): Mr. Speaker, Sir, i have only two very small comments on this very straightforward Bill.First of all, I would like to say that we are very glad to see the AttorneyGeneral back with us in the House and that we wish him very quick recovery.I would first address myself to the Civil Procedure Act. The position we are in now in this country is that if you have a civil suit against anybody, even if you are suing for Sh. 1,000, it would take you five years to have that case heard in a court of law because of the great accumulation of simple civil cases which are not being heard under the present establishment of magis¬trates in our courts. I think we have reached a stage almost comparable to the land cases with regard to which we had a very, very useful amendment here in 1981. I would very strongly urge that the Attorney General looks for a way of amending this Act to enable the speeding up of cases whereby, for example, if some¬body has my money and where there is no dispute about this fact except for the court to give some power to recover that debt.I know that this delay and the backlog in question is being abused by very many people who just refuse to pay because they know that even if you go ,to the court, it will take you five years. They ask themselves, "Why should we bother?" I think we are slowly grind¬ing our economy, particularly in the commercial and industrial sector, to terrible low level because of people taking advantage of the fact that our law is cumbersome in recovering debts. I think we have many examples in Europe particularly, in places like Switzerland, etcetera, where the recovering of debts is a matter of a single morning so long as you can prove to the Slate that you are owed this money, in which case, you do not even have to go to court but you just go to the Government to assist you to collect your debt.I am sure my learned friend is much more versed in these questions. I would like us to explore the possibility whereby straightforward, particularly debt, cases are handled swiftly and expeditiously so that we can rid ourselves of the few people who are running away with other people’s money. Many people are now borrowing so much money on promisery notes and, after a short while, they bug off to other parts of the world at great expense of those who are left behind. Therefore, I would very much appeal to my colleague, the AttorneyGeneral to look into whatever ways that will help to speed up the procedures entailed in the Civil Procedure Act, particularly as reflecting the re¬covery of debts.The second and last point, Mr. Speaker, which I would like to make is, again, in respect of the same Civil Procedure Act. I see that in the Memorandum of Objects and Reasons the AttorneyGeneral is suggesting that we should raise the interest, rates of moneys owed from six to 12 per cent this is doubling up of the interest rate, I agree, but I would have thought that we should make it possible that any debt owed should be charged at the commercial bank interest rate so that it is conducive to the person who should be paying to pay. Otherwise, if he is going to enjoy a 12 per cent interest rate, instead of going to borrow money at 14 per cent interest rate, he will take his free time until such time as he can afford to pay because that money is available to him at a subsidized interest rate. I think if we are going to change the interest rate, we should change at such that it is at par with money from any other commercial bank: whatever that rate is  it should apply even in cases of money that is owed through the court. I hope that .the Attorney General will bring a little amendment to make that possible. With those few remarks, Sir, I beg to support the Bill. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>Kariuki: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I would like to just point out a few .things in as far as these Bills are concerned. First of all, as far as the Civil Procedure Act is concerned, I do agree with. hon. Wenjigi that the interest rate of 12 per cent that has been suggested if, a bit too low because once a matter has been taken to count in a civil case and a debtor has been ordered by the court to pay a certain amount of money, this is now money owing to the creditor and the creditor is not using this money because it is with, the debtor. This same creditor may be forced to go and borrow money at bank rate which now ranges from 14 per cent to 19 per cent interest rate. So, if the creditor is allowed to charge an interest on his money that is below the bank rate, he is, in fact, suffering the dif-ference between the 12 per cent and whist he is actually paying to the financial institution or the bank to borrow the same amount of money. So, I do concur with hon. Wanjigi what this interest rate should concur wish what¬ever the bank rate is at the time of the judgmentSir, I would also like to point out something in as far as the Companies (Amendment) Bill is concerned. it is well and good that persons should be able to find out what are the charges are against the property of a company. They should be able to find out from the Registrar of Companies. But there is one thing that is bothering our people a lot these days. That is the fact that although in law he know that individuals who own a company are separate people some financial institutions and banks are trying to diffuse or to minimize that difference. The result is that whenever a company goes to borrow money, the banks and financial institutions do not only insist that the company gives them adequate  security that  is by changing the properties of the company they will charge the properties of the company and in addition to that, ask for person  guarantees.<i>[Mr. Speaker left the Chair]</i><i> [Mr. Deputy Speaker took the Chair]</i>Sir, this removes whatever difference the law re¬cognizes between the company and the individual that make up the company. This has put a lot of people into problems because if I start a shoemanufacturing company, the bank is not willing to lend me money on the security of the assets of the company unless in addition. I am willing to charge my other property for securities to the bank it is very un reasonable and very inequitable for the bank or financial institu¬tion to, in addition to add the securities  that my  com¬pany has given  further insist that I in addition give them personal guarantees  That means that when the project fails by any chance, the bank or the financial institution  can recover the money by selling the assets of the company. It so happens that sometimes the bank or the financial institution does not take enough trouble by getting the best buyer for the property that was changed by the company because they know that if they do not get their money back by selling the assets of the company, they can always go back to the individual. That means that an individual will be left with nothing he will even have his house sold. I can say for debts that are owing to him personally but for debts that are owned by the company to the bank or the financial institution.So, Sir, i think the AttorneyGeneral should at one time think whether it is not the time that he should not just think of protecting the financiers but also think of a way to protect the borrowers. When the financiers are lending money, they should be careful that the protects for which they are lending money are viable, they should be certain that the company for which he protects for which they are lending money has enough assets to guarantee the payment of that money. If I form a company that company is supposed to run the best possible but if that company is in the end going to be the ruin not only of me but even my children mother and grandfather because of what they call personnel guarantees. I Think the banks and financial institutions that we have are being given too much of a leeway. This means as I have said before that they do not when they are lending money dig deep into the details of the details of what the finances are required and whether the project that they are lending money for its viable or whether the company has adequate assets. If a company does not adequate assets they can at least tell the share holders to add to the assets of the company from their own properties. When these properties are being changed let them be the properties of the company so that if the company fails it is only the company that is failing and not his children and his wife. With those few remarks, Sir I beg to support</NEWSPEECH><Newspeech> The Assistant Minister for Health ( Mr. Muigai ) :Thanks you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, SirSir we are always happy to see amendments to our laws as we go along and gain more experience as the law changes the situation in which we live in also change and we support that. We cannot over emphasize what the Attorney General has said about lawyers. We would to change directions because there are too many of them who involve themselves in malpractice. We are used to looking at lawyers as custodian of law. In recent past our lawyers have left a lot to be desires. I would like to ask the Attorney General to look into the situation where a lot of lawyers take small people’s cases and are paid between Ksh. 2000 and Ksh. 4,000 and they never deal with those cases because, may be they have other bigger cases that matter a lot than the small ones they get from the ordinary wananchi. I am sure other hon. Members will agree with me because the number of wananchi who come to our offices telling us that such and such a lawyer has taken Ksh. 2000 or Ksh. 5000 from me and opened a file on my case but I cannot find him. Sometimes when the ordinary wananchi who goes to such a lawyer he is told that if he wants he can go to another lawyers but he cannot be refunded his money. These cases are becoming too many and we wonder what the attorney general could do with them because the people then lose faith in the system of law. These are small people who come from up country to Nairobi meeting very high transport charges and they should be cared forMr. Deputy Speaker, Sir I would also like to ask Attorney General to look more into the law of receivables and liquidation. The companies of many enterprises are money, machine and people. You find that the law provides for safe custody. Where money has been lent it is very elaborate what should be done once a company goes into receivership or liquidation. Those who lend money and they have the securities are very well covered. You also find that the law covers any eventualities on assets of such companies that go into receivership or liquidation. However, the law completely leave the workers open. We have to be specific.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, when a company goes into liquidation and is consequently is bought by some¬body else, the new owner has no obligation to continue giving employment to the people who have been working to the company whether they have worked there for 16 to 20 years. The workers services are terminated and the new owner can go on TO recruit other people the way he wishes.It is always such that you have to go and beg with new owners so that the old workers can continue in their employment.Sir, there are all so benefits ithait get lioslt. Whatever the workers contribute in terms of pension schemes is not considered by the new owners. The new owners have absolutely no responsibility for the contributions that have been previously made by the employees for vary many years, I even know a case and I wrote to the Attorney GeneraI about it concerning a boy whose hand was cut off when he was at work. Subsequently the company went into liquidaition and in the meantime the court awarded the boy some damages. However, he cannot collect compensation from any¬where because when a company goes into receiver¬ship the workers lose. Whatever rights they may have had are lost. I think this is a very serious affair. We know that machine and money wre sweet for 5 or 10 years and so on to a company. We would like to request the Attorney-General look at the law, particularly where the workers can get their rights when companies go into receiver ship or liquidation. With those few remards, I support.</NEWSPEECH><Newspeech> Prof. Indire:Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for giving me an opportunity ti say one or two things on this Bill. Certainly I do support the amendments because any Bill that is brought to this House, as the Attorney General said comes on order to benefit our people and therefore, we must support it. The Only thing I would like to say is that when making amendment I would hope that the attorney general looks at the entire act so that amendments are made completely and not to make piecemeal amendments, which in turn introduce too many other amendments to the exact of confusing people. When they want to look at the laws, I would hope that we look at the entire Act so that there is much not to be done later. Certainly a miner amendment may be a very important one in his implication.Sir, there are still terms that one finds in our laws which one hopes could be removed from the laws. I was recently reading something which still refers to the Indian Act of the year 1900, or back in the 1800s. After some 20 years of independence we should have a law which we have made as Kenyans and we do not have to refer to another country, as was the ease during the colonial period. I know that there is much that the Attorney general is doing to amend such sec¬tions, but for some people to continue reading in our laws the referece to other countries it would be butter for such sections to disapper. We are actually relying on an Act thait was passed in another country. " I therefore support those mirror amendments and would only hope that which they are called “mirror” they are indeed mirror and that we do not have to come back to the same law a year, or six months, later to bring another mirror. Amendments to the same act we were dealing with the amendments would be done in full and changes made which would last a little longer and which would enable the Attorney-General to provide amendments in to. As then Attorney-General said in these amendments that they are mirror and not necessary to amend the entire Act, one would certainly agree with that kind of thing However, it would be better, as I have said if the entire Act is examined and the amendments come in so that we can read the whole act and have the real meaning of the Act we are amending hoping that whatever we amend will be used for a long time to come.if this is done, Mr. Deputy Speaker, we will move forward. I do understand that there is a Law Reform Commission that is working and one hopes that this work will be hastened so that we have laws which we can look at without blaming anybody in the past. We should not blame those who made the laws during the colonial .period. If we are slow, we must,therefore, blame.ourselves for not amending the laws in time. We should not blame somebody when we have been inde¬pendent for more than 20years.I certainly support the amendments and hope that the House will also support them, so .that we can help our judges and those who assist tiliem to govern us and do what we need on the basis of our peoples require¬ments.With those few remarks, I support. </NEWSPEECH><Newspeech> Mr. Shikuku: Ahsante sana, Bw. Naibu .Spifca kwa kunipa nafasi hij niseme machache kuhusu Mswada huu. J am bo la fcwanza ni kwamba Mkuu wa Sheria alipokuwa akiuwasilisha Msw.ada huu niiimsikiliza kwa makini sana. Latoini aliamua kusema machache kuhusu Mswada huu. Kwa rnfano a.ligusia Civil Procedure Act, Advocates Act; Criminal Act, Pensions Act na kumaliza. IIapa alisahau ltazi yake. Sisi wengine tuliokuwa huko Lancaster House tulikata sbauri kuwa. Mkuu wa Sheria awe. mmoja ya wanachama wa Bunge hili kwa shauri moja tn. Shaud liilo, ijapokiuvva Mkuu wa Sheria hachaguliwini kuwa aje hapa na kazii yake liwe ni kuitueleza kinaganaga ni sheria gani tunayohitajika ku unda na. ni sheria gani inayofaa kurekehishwa na pia kutusleza Icinaganaga ni kwa nini marekebisho yaweko. Lakini aliacha kutueleza mambo mengi sana. Sisi wengi¬ne tulio hapa si mawakili. Sisi tuko hapa kulunga sheria za kuhifadhi mali ya wahotuchagua kuja hapa.Nilisema hapo rnbeleni kwamba Kama kuna habari katika Range hili iko kaitiika Misce,. neous Bills. Hii ni kwa sababu Mhe. Mbunge anaihitnji muda wa kuketi chini na kuusoma Mswada na sheria nyingine iili aweze kujua ni toilu gani ambacho lciinabadilishwa na ni kwa niiii kinabadilis.hwa. Wakaiti mwingine unawcza kuona ni Wabunge wachache tu arnbao wanasimama kuzungu mria Miisceilainioeus BiMS. Hii ni kwa sababu ni kazi ikubwa kusoma sheriia zote. Ni lazima ufanye home wor? ya kutosha ili uweze kifzungumziia Miscellaneous Amendment Bills.Hata ukisoma Memorandum of Object and Reasons ya Mswada uJio mbele yetu, iiifcaona kuna lcitu ambacho Idnakosekama. Pia ukiusoma Mswada huu kuanzia Uku jasa wa 287 na kuendelea mbele uiaona kwamba ni vita gani ambavyo Hunataka kubadilisha. Kwanza ni lazima usome ihapa na pale ili uweze kujua ni vifungu gani ambavyo tunataika kubadilisha. Kufanya hiivyo ni kazi kubwa sana. Kwa hivjo, ingefaa kazi ihiyo irahisishwe. Mkuu wa Sheria angatumia muda aliopewa kueleza kinaganaga ni kva sababu garni itunabadilisha vifungu viingine. Lakini yeye alisema maneno machache halafu akaketi cliini.Kwa rnfano, alizungumzia Local Authorities Provi¬dent Fund Act, na Registered Land Act. Lakini hakutu eleza Cho. chote kuhusu Kerio Valley Development Authority  Act. Pia hakuweaa kutuambia cho choite kuhusu Customs find Excise and Companies Act. Ali tuambia maneno machache kuhusu" Transfer of Pro¬perty Act. Lakini kuhusu Petroleum Act hakuLueleza cho chote. Baada ya kufanya hivyo, alisema "kwa hayo machache" halafu akaketi chini. Vitu kama hivyo ndivyo ambavyo vinatuletea hatari. Baadhi ya vitu hivyo ni hatari.Katika Ukurasa wa 281 Mswada unaongea juu ya mawakili. Ninayakubaliana na yale maneno yaliyose mwa na Mkuu wa Sheria. Lafcini ni jambo la kusikitisha, kama vile Waingereza wanavyosema, ni kusiikia yale mambo ambayo yaoawakabili mawakili. Ni lazima sisd kama ibaba za watoto hao tuliangalie jarnbo hilo. Ime kuaje katikati ya mwaka 1983 na 1984 mawakdli 60 walifcifikishwa mbele. ya kamati ya nidhamu? Kati yao mawakili saba walifutwa na mawakili 24 wakapigwa faini. Nilikuwa nikimsMiza Mkuu wa Sheria kwa harnu sana. Alisema mawakili wengine walipelekwa jela. Lakini hakusema ni wangapi ambao walipelekwa jela. Pi a alisema kwamba mwafca huu kuna mawakili 50 ambao wamekwishafikishwa mbele ya kamati ya nidhamu.Kwa hivyo, ni lazima Mkuu wa Sheria, Wabunge na Mawazid tuketi chini pamoja ili ituweze kujua ni kwa nini mchezo huu wa kutokuwa na nidhamu kwa mawa¬kili unaendelea. Mimi sikumwuliza mawakili hao ni wa kabila au rangi gani. Lakini nina hakika kwamba 96 asilimia ni Wafrika. Ni kwa nini jambo hilo linafanyika? Ni lazima tuliangalie jambo hilo. Tunakubaliana na badi liko la Mkuu wa Sheria kwamba baada ya mtu kuwa suspended asdkubaliwe kufanya appeal na halafu aende lee kufanya kazi ya uwakili. Ninakubaliana na jambo hilo.Lakini hiyo siyo dawa. Dawa ni kujua chanzo cha jambo hilo. Ni lazima sisi kama Wabunge, viongozi wa nchd hii tuketi ili :tuweze kujua chanzo cha jambo hilo. Lakini chanzo cha ubaya wote ni pesa. Ni kwa nini wanataka pesa? Hii ni kwa sababu katika Kenya leo, huwezi kuwa fciongozi wa maana kama wewe hutoi pesa. Ufcitoa pesa nyingi katika mikutano ya Harambee, maneno yalko ni mazuri. Lakini ikiwa unatoa pesa kidogo fauna maana. Wengine wanasema, "hatutaki ma¬neno; tunataka vitendo". Huu ndio ukweli mchungu lakini si uwongo mtamu. Hii .ni kwa sababu katika Kenya hivi sasa hakuna morals. Moral ni pesa. Ukiwa na pesa hata ikiwa umeziiba pesa hizo, huulizwi umezi paitaje. Ukitoa pesa wewe ni fciongozi. Kwa hivyo, unaweza kusema maneno yote.</NEWSPEECH><Newspeech> The Minister for Energy, and Regional Development (Mr. Biwott): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is the hon. Member not going out of order by implying that everybody who gives Harambee money has stolen that money? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Shikuku: Kwanza sikuyasema maneno hayo. Waziri akipata nafasi ya kunzungumza atasema yale yote ambayo angetaka kusema. Mimi sikusema hivyo. Singetaka Waziri ajaribu kuniwekelea maneno. Pitina ndiyo fcitu kibaya katika Kenya sasa. Kama yeye ni Mkristo angejua kwamba ile dhambi ambayo Mungu anakataa zaidi ni kumsingizia mwenzako au kutoa ushahidi usio wa kweli kuhusu mwenzako. Tungetaka Waziri aliangalie jambo hilo ili asije akakosa kuingia Mtoinguni.Kwa hivyo, chanzo cha maovu ni pesa. Jambo hilo limeandikwa katika Biblia. Pesa zikiwekwa mbele va kila kitu, uovu unaingia. Jambo hilo liko wazi katika Kenya sasa. Akina Shikuku wanashiakiwa kwamba wanasema maneno bila kuvatenda mambo. Ukitaka kuyatenda mambo ni lazima uwe na pesa. Kama huna njia ya kupata pesa, maneno yako hata yakiwa mazuri namna gani, hayatakiwi. Hiyo ndiyo hatari iliyoko ka¬tika Kenya. Kwa hivyo, jambo hilo linawahusu mawa¬kili. Wabunge na watu wengine walio nje ya Bunge hili. Hii ni kwa sababu pesa zimewekwa mbele ya mambo yote. Pesa ndiyo Mungu wa Kenya sasa. Uki¬taka kuingia katika Bunge hili ni lazima utoe pesa nyingi ill uweze kujulikana kwamba unayalenda ma¬mbo. Lakini huwezi kuulizwa ni wapi unatoa pesa hizo. Tunafahamu ile mishahara watu mbalimbali hupata. Hicho ndicho chanzo cha maovu. Ni lazima sasa tuaiigalie ni kwa nini jambo hilo linafanyika. Kuna iambo moja anibalo nimefikiria sana. Mimi huyafikiria mambo saa zote. Wengi wa mawakili walio Wafrika hawapati kazi ya kufanya. That h why they are frustrated. Hii ni kwa sababu mawakili wasio raia wa Kenya wamechukua kazi zote za halmashauri zetu na makampuni makubwa makubwa. Wao wanapata pesa bila kwenda po pote. Lakini mawakili walio Wafrika hawana njia ya kupata chakula. Mtu akikosa kupata cliakula aiakuwa mwizi. Huo ndio ukweli mchungu. Zilc kazi ambazo zingefauywa na Wafrika, zimechu kuliwa na mawakili wasio Wafrika. Sasa hawana njia ya kujisaidia. Kwa hivyo, waikipata Sh. 20,000 au Sh. 50,000 wanaona kwamba wamefanlikiwa na wana tumia pesa hiyo. Kwa hivyo, ni lazima lufikirie tumbo ya mawakili Wafrika. Ni lazima wapewe kazi ya kufanya. Tungetaka wapewe kazi yote katika hal¬mashauri zetu. Pia ingefaa tuwatengenezee chama ki¬rn oj a cha ushirika. Tungetaka mawakili walio Wafrika wawe na makampuni makubwa ya mawakili kama Kaplan and Slratton; Hamilton, Harrison and Mathews and kadhalika. Hao ndio wananyonya sisi na hali watu wetu hawana mahali pa kula. Sasa wamekuwa wezi.Pengine hawawezi kuingia Mbinguni. Wengine tfi kufa na kuchomeka milele.Bw. Naibu Spika, inahitajika sasa Mkuu wa Sheria kupeana kazi kwa yale makampuni yote na halmasha¬uri yote na cho chote kinahusiika na Seriikali yetu. hii ambayo ni ya Wafrika, wao wapewe kazi hizo wafanye. Lakini sasa kazi hizo zimechukuliwa na makampuni haya ambayo yanachukua pesa hizo na kupeleka njc. Wakishapata biashara ya kutosha waaapeleka faiida nje ya Kenya kufuatana na sheria yetu, siyo nasema eti wanachuk.ua bure. Lakini tena wao wakikaa hapa wana marafiki zao ambao wanakuja hapa na pesa wanaweka ngambo. Mwafrika atapata chakula wapi, na tuna ambiwa tuwasomeshe watoto? Kila siku Waziri akisi marna hapa au Mbunge anasema "Watoto wa shule ni viongozt wa siku zijazo"; lakini tunawapa maturnaini ambayo hawataona ngo; watakuwa wezi. Sasa wezi ambao wamesoma ni hatari sana kwa sababu wana weza kupanga mambo. Eti wao ni viongozi wa Kenya kesho: wametoka chuo kikuu na masomo makubwa makubwa, mawakili na kadhalika, lakini kesho kutwa yuko jela. Maana gani kupoteza mtu wa aina hiyo?Sisi tunazungumza kwa uchungu kwa sababu pesa zinazowasomesha watoto katika chuo kikuu ni mali ya Kenya; ni ushuru wangu au ushuru v,a watu wa Butere, Teso. ria kadhalika. Ushuru.huu unapotea mtu anapo kwenda jela. Kwa hivyo, ni wajibu wetu kuangalia jambo hili kwa macho mawili kwa sababu ni jambo la muhimu na watu wetu wapewe kazi.Jambo lingine, Bw. Naibii Spika, hawa mawakili wakitoka mafunzo yao katika chuo kkuu, nafikiri jambo lingine anibao Mkuu wa Sheria anaweza kuli fanya ni hili: Wakati umefika nmbapo wengine waji funze kazi ya mashtaka, yaani kazi ya prosecution kwa sababn ukienda kortini utapata kuwa wakiii yuko hapc na inspekta mkuu wa poiisi yuko hapo na anajaribu kushindana na wakili. Tena unajua kwamba ijapokuwo yule inspekta mkuu wa poiisi amepita mtdfaaOii wa sheria hana ujuzi wa kushindana na wakili. Wakati mwingine inspekta wa poiisi anapigiwa kelele na wakiii. Kwa hivyo, badala ya kuacha hawa watu wakose knzi lunaanza kutafuta kazi. It is not enough to say "I am an AttorneyGeneral"; lakini kazi ya Mkuu wa Sheria ni kuangalia watu watakuwa nini. Njia ya kuwapa chakula ni kuwachukua hawa mawakili wengi hapa wengine ambao hawnendelei vizuri na biashara ya kazi ya binafsi, yaani private practice, na kuwapatia kazi ya prosecutors badala ya hawa poiisi ambao hawaelewi sheriaso that they can balance their arguments.Jambo la tatu, Bw. Naibu Spika, ningali r.azungumza juu ya chakula: ni kwa nini hawa watu wana njaa ili tuweze kupata manufaa ambayo yanaweza kutufaa kwa siku ziijazo kwa sababu tungaili tunahitaji hawa watoto ambao tumcsomesha na tunataka tupate maUmda Iu toka kwao badala ya kuwatupa nje na kusema et.i hawa ni wezi; Wafrika hawawezi kuendeea vizuri na kazi ya sheria na hatujasikia Mwingcreza au Mzungu au Mhindi amepelckwa jela. Kwani Mungu ameuir.ba Wafrika tu ndiyo wawe wezi? It ir because of lack of opportunity, ya?ni kukosa nafasi za kazi. Wale wana nafasi baba zao wamcwatengenezea Icanipuni zico. Wa kitoka shuleni wanaenda kukaa huko. Sis: ha.una ka mpuni ya Mwafrika atakuia kukaa. Kwa hivyo. ba shahara iliyoko hapa imechukuliwa r.a hawa tidugu zetu. Hujawahi kumwona Mhindi barabarani akitafuta kazi. Pia hujawahi kumwona Mzungu akitembea bara¬barani akitafuta kazi. Anayctafuta kazi ni Mwafrika kwa sababu hajatengenezewa mahali ambapo alaingia akishamaliza masomo. Hay a ni manetvo tu. Sisi tiuncsha pata Uhuru na ni lazima tujifikine. Hatuna bwana mwingine. Lakini tukikaa hapa kama "Waheshimhva Wabunge" na kupitisha Miswada. St. hawa watu v.a nvongwe kabisa, sasa watak wenda wapi wakkoka jela? Tngefaa Mkuu wa Sheria alete Mswada mwingine wa kusema kwamba mtu a kishatoka jela tumhamishe kwa sababu taabu pale ni yako. Mtoto akiwa ni kiwete ni wako. Watoto vvote Wanakenya na wale mabhhop. Mawaziri na kadhalika. sisi sote, ni watu wa Mtukufu Rais. Hawezi kutoa sheria wapdekwe Somalia. Hapana. Viwete ni vyake. Hawezi kumpa Rais wa Somalia, Ethiopia, Sudan au Tanzania. Kwa hivyo, lukishawa funga jela, what next? Watakaa hapa na wataendelca na juhudi za kutusumbua kwa sababu hawa watu ambao ni intellectuals, they are capable of planning anything. Kwa hivyo, tuwanngalie kwa macho mawili kwa sababu watatulclea taabu. Hata juzi wengine v/a mehitimu uainasheria. Watakwenda wapi? Kwa hivyo, ni lazima tufikiri na iwe ni ka/.i va Mkuu wa Sheria. mimi, na Wabunire wole hapa laileta maoni ya kum saidia Mkuu wa Sheria ili atoc inkale kwa hawa watu ili wasije wakawa wezi.The Civil Procedure Act ambayo inahitajika tufanye matoadiliko hapo kwa section 27 (2) Cap. 21. Anasema iiii "six per cent per annum" iwe sasa 12 per cent er annum". Namwunga mfcono. Lakini nakubaliana na wale Wabunge waiiosema kwamba hii iwe at the commercial rate; isiwe 12 ili watu wengine wajue eti ni mchezo. Pia, hawa. watoto tunasomesha kama mawakili hawasomi habari ya civil? Kama wamasoma habari ya civil hawa mawakdli ambao tunasema hawana niidhamu na kadhalika. mboria Mkuu wa Sheria asiwachu kue hawa luongeze idadi ya majaji wa civil ili kesi zie nde upesi kwa sababu zilo kesii ambazo wenzangu wame serrva ziwaweza kuchukua hate miafca minane. Hili ni jambo la ajabu eti haita. criminal case inaweza kuchu¬kua miafca imitatu. So, Sir, I suggest and submitkama vile mawakili wanavyosema huko kortinikwamba Mkuu wa Sheria aongeze majaji wa civil eases, na ifciwa ni pesa, tukate pe.sa kila mahali ili majaji waandi fcwe wengi wa civil oases iti waharakishe kazi. Justice is sweeter than anything else under the sun Haki ambayo tanaimba kwa wimbo wetu ni Mtu kikubwa. Hata ukimpa mtu nyumba nzuri na umwekee kila kitu Kizuri na umnyime haki yalke, basi nyumba hiyo haina maana ikwake.Kwa hivyo, wakatii umefika kwa Mkuu wa Sheria kiiwaaiiri maiaji wengi. Hatungetalka atwambie hakuna pesa. Hapana. Ninasema hivyo kwa sababu haki inashi nda kila kitu. Tuko tayari kulala niaa lakini kuwe na haki. Kama kuna mtu ailiyeVaitswa kesi ya kunyongwa lakini aambiwe na jaji, "Saca wewe k wen da nyumbani uwaone watoto wako", haita usipompaitia chakula. ata tembea aendc zake kwa sababu amepata haki. Kwa hivyo, educaition, social services, na kadhalika viwekwe nyurha ili haki ipaibikane Tungetaka idadi ya majaji lionge.zwe.Bw. Naibu Spika, mimi hnsema jambo hili kila siku na siiui kama Mkuu wa Sheria husikia au la. Sijtti kama angetaka aonje injustice ndipo aweze kuiua vile ninayosema. Mimi husema kila mwaka kwamba maiaji waongezwe. Mimi nililamba injustice hiyo, and that is why I know what justice is. You will never know justice unless you have, injustice. Mkuu wa Sheria akichukuliwa nyumbani ikwake awekwe korokoroni kwa wifci mbilii bila kumwona bibi na watoto wake pengine aitafahamu fci dogo. Akipelekwa korokoroni na halafu aambiwe, "We¬we. kesi yako italetwa mwezi wa February mwaka wa 1986, for mention only, pengine Mkuu wa Sheria ata-fahamu.</NEWSPEECH><Newspeech>An  hon Member : Nani? </NEWSPEECH><Newspeech> Mr, Shikuku: Mkuu wa Sheria a.tafahamu. Lakini hawezi kufahamu bivi sasa Bw. Naibu Spika, mimi ni kama mtu anayemhubiria mtu mwingine.  Waswahilii husema kumwashia fcipofu aa ni kuharibu mafuta kwa sababu hawezi kuona. Kwa hivyo, yeyc hajaonja. Justice is everything; justice is a hinge of everything. Huwszi kunipiga na halafu uni anibie habari ya mapenzi. No. Uikinipa haki yangu, Bw. Naibu Spika, nitakupenda. Hata ukisema nikubebe kwa mgongo wangu, nitakubeba kwa sababu utakuwa ume nipatia haki. Kwa hivyo ni lazima haki itimizwe.Kitu kilichotufanya .tupiganie Uhuru, Bw. Naibu Spika, ni kutokuwa na haki. Watu wengine walifariki wakipigania haki, na sisi tuliohai tungali tunatafuta haki hiyo. Tuko tayani kufariki kwa kusema haki na ukweli. Kwa hivyo, ingefaa Mkuu wa Sheria aongeze idadi ya majaji. Civil judges wanaweza kupatikana kuto ka kwa vijana wanasheria wanaojaribu kufanya kazi zao binafsi. Tungetaka wanasheria hao wafanywe majaji katika idara ya mahakama ili waweze kufanya kazi hii ya kusikiza civil and criminal cases. Sijui inaweza kuchu kua muda gani, lakini ninajua kuna wanasheria wengine wanaoweza kufanya kazi hii. Kuna majaji wengine wa changa who have proved to be very responsible katika kazi zao, kama yule anayetoka upande wa Butere. He is a young man, na anaendesha kazi ya ujaji.</NEWSPEECH><Newspeech> An hon. Member: Ni nani huyo? </NEWSPEECH><Newspeech>Mr. Shikuku</Newspeech>: Kwa hivyo, ingefaa tuwapatie kazi ili wasiwe wezi. Hilo ni jambo la muhimu.Kuhusu Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 75), scction 123 (3), ningetaka kusema kwamba ninaunga rakono badiliko ambalo limeletwa na Mkuu wa Sheria. Badiliko hili Iimenipatia nafasi ya kuzungumza juu ya kitu ki nachoitwa "bail". Wakafci mwingine wananclii wanao shikwa kuwa wezi na wanyanganvi wa kutumia nguvu. wauaji, na kadhalika katika sehemu za mashambani hupata faabu. Kwa mfano, mwananchi anaweza kushi kwa siku ya Ijumaa jioni na kupelekwa rumande, na kw.i vile korti huwa haifanyi kazi siku za Jumamosi na Juma pili, huwa ni lazima mwananchi huyo apelekwe kortini siku ya Jumaatu. Kama tunataka haki. ingefaa mtu alive shikwa apelekwe kortini haraka iwerekanavyo. Sheria inasema kuwa mtu apelekwe kortini within 24 hours, au maximum 48 hours. Lakini utakuta kwamba watu huketi korokoroni zaidi ya muda huo, na hiyo si haki. Wananchi wanajua kwamba hii hufanyika. Ukimwambia mwananchi kwamba kuna haki, hukuuliza: "Haki ye nyewe iko wapi? Mimi nimeketi korokoroni kwa muda wa siku nane au siku kumi." Je. haki iko wapi?Bw. Naibu Spika, kuna kesi nvingine ndogo ndogo ambapo mtu angeweka dhamana aende nyumbani kwa ke. lakini badala yake huwekwa korokoroni ili apate dhiki juu va Serikali yetu. Ni lazima mchezo huu uko meshwe. Hata polisi wengine wachache hufurahi kuwa mbia wananchi, "Mtawekwa korokoroni". Hata kama ni yeye aliyekosea, husema atakuweka korokoroni, na kweli hukuweka korokoroni Hii ndiyo sababu mimi ihurudia kusema jambo hili. Bunge hili litaweka kwa rekodi yake kwamba kulikuwa na mtu hapa aliyeitwa Shikuku kutoka Butere. Alikuwa akisema tukitaka haki na ukweli, basi viongozi waonie ile isiyo ihafci. Kwa mfano, tunaweza kumchukua Mhe. Waziri wa Fedha, ambave hajaona mlango wa jela, na kumweka ndani wiki mbili. </NEWSPEECH><Newspeech> An hon. Member: Bila kufanya mafcosa </NEWSPEECH><Newspeech> Mr. Shikukn: Haiaona jela.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>The Assistant Minister for Environment and Natural Resources (Mr. arap CheboiwoV Anawekwa bure.</NEWSPEECH>1923 Bill<Newspeech> Mr. Shikuku:Ndiyo. ndipo aiue injustice ni nni Ni wananchi wansapi wanaowekwa kule bure? Kulikuwako na wananchi wengine waliopelekwa kortini, wakafungwa jela, wakakaa gerezani kwa zaidi ya miaka 20, na ba adaye wakatolewa na korti kwa vile hawakuwa na makosa. Tulisoma mambo yao hivi majuzi. Mtu kama Mhe. Anyumba awekwe ndani bure. Wakitoka huko, wataongeza idadi ya majaji mara moja. Waswahili hu¬sema kikifaa ni cha Bw. Swedi, na kikiharibika ni cha Fundi Mwalimu. Swedi hataki maovu. Hii ndiyo sababu nlnasema Wabunge, Mawaziri, majaji wenyewe, polisi na maofisa wa jela wawekvve ndani ili waweze kujua justice, is something good. Wakiwekwa ndani, watahara kisha kesi za watu.Bw. Naibu Spika, ninakumbuka kulikuwako na daktari mmoja aliyekuwa akiiayarisha chakula cha wafungwa kule Kamiti. Yeye alikuwa akisema, "Mfu ngwa atakula chakula hiki na kile". Daktari huyo huyo alifungwa jela, na alipopewa Chakula hicho, alisema, "No, this is no good for human consumption", lakini akaambiwa, "Wewe ndiye uliyeandika chakula hiki, na kwa hivyo kimetosha." Alionja na akaona hakukuwa chakula cha kuliwa na binadamu. Yeye alikuwa akitoa prescription kwa wengine, lakini alipoewa chakula hicho. aliona kwamba chakula hicho haki.kuwa kizuri. Hayo yalikuwa mafunzo kwake. Hii ndiyo sababu nina¬sema sisi viongozi, before anybody is promoted, ingefaa aadhibiwe kidogo, aonje ili ajuq shida ya mwananchi mdogo ni nini. Hivi sasa haijui bali anasmkia tu. Hii ni kama unavyosikia mama ana labour pains. Unasikia tu labour pains" lakini hujui ni nini. Ukijua, utafahamu ni kwa nini mama hulia. Kwa hivyo, wapelekwe hulco ili justice ifanyvve mara moia. Hata wanapowekwa ndani. hutoka mara moja k\va sababu wana pesa. Mtu mdogo hupata shida kubwa. Roho huniuma ninapo zungumza juu ya jambo hili kwa sababu ninajua kile ninachosema. Watu wadogo wanajua kile Shikuku anachosema. Hii ndiyo sababu maneno ya Shikuku hushinda ya wakubwa kwa sahabu nimeikwishaonja taabu kama wao.Bw. Naibu Spika, ni lazima ule mchezo wa kuweka watu korokoronii zaidi ya saa 24 ukomeshwe. Ni lazima muda huo upunguzwe. And if possible, Sir, justice should be done even on Sunday. Korti inaweza kuketi hata siku ya Jumamosi ili watu wapate justice. It 5s not something that can wait because one. minute in the cell is equivalent to one year outside the cell. Kwa hivyo, ninaonelea kwamba ni afadhaii kort zifanye kazi siku za Jumamosi na Jumapili. Ninakumbuka wakata wa "JM" korti iliketi ndani ya nyumba ya mtu ambapo mtu mmoja aliambiwa aende kumfuatilia "JM". Why can it not also be done? Koriti iliketi ndani ya nyumba ya mtu, na mtu akatolewa jela kwenda kumfuatilia "JM", mpaka akauawa. That was for evil. Why do you not do it for good?Jambo hili linawezekana ili haki ipatikane. Sina uwezo lakini kama ingewezekana. ningemchukua Mkuu wa Sheria na kumtia ndani ndipo ajue haki iko wapi. Vile vile ukiangalia ukurasa wa 282 katika Mswada huu utaona kwamba sheria ya The Evidence Act (Cap. 80) inatajwa. Sehemu ya 3 (1) inatoa maana ya "bank". Utaona kwamba wanaondoa sehemu za (a) na (b) na kuweka sehemu nvinsine mpya. Mimi naliunna rnkooo jambo hili. Lakini ninfrenenda kumwomba Mkuu wa Sheria atueleze kama sehemu hii ya sheria inahusika wakati wanataka kuichunguza akiba ya mtu katika benki. Latent inawabidi waende kwa hakimu ambaye ataitoa barua ambayo itamruhusu inspector au mtu ye yote wa C.I.D. au Special Branch kwenda kuchu nguza account ya kampuni fulani au ya mtu bmafsi.Lakini utaona kwamba ni hivi majuzi ambapo nili gundua kwamba ati kulikuwa na mtu ambaye alienda kuikagua account ya Butere SellHelp Fund innamo mwaka wa 1982; mwingine alienda kuichunguza account hiyo mwaka huu wa 1985. Lakini utaona kwamba sisi maofisa wa chama hicho haitukuambiwa. Nilikuwa niki dihani kwamba pengine Mkuu wa Sheria angeleta amend¬ment hapa ambayo itawahitaji wale wanaotaka kuchu nguza account ya mtu fulani wawe wakim.iulisha mtu huyo kimbele kuhusu jambo kama hilo. Kama wana¬taka kuichunguza account ya Mhe. Kisiero, ingefaa Mhe. Kisiero aambiwe "account yako itaangaliwa". Lakini ikiwa mimi ninaweza kwenda kwa magistrate nipate barua ya kuniwezesha kwenda kuichunguza account ya Mhe. Kisiero, basi siri ya account haita kuwepo tena. That is being abused now. Wale waiio kwenda kuichunguza account ya Butere SelfHelp Fund hawakupata kosa lo late. Juzi niliiweka ripoti ya mka guzi kuhusu Butere SelfHelp Fund katika Meza ya Bunge. Ripoti hiyo inasema kwamba wale watumishii wa Serikali ndio walikula pesa hizo; si Bw. Shikuku walla mfuasi wa Shikuku. Niliiweka ripoti hiyo juu ya Meza hapa na haikupingwa na mtu ye yote. Therefore, it is a legal document. It was laid on the Table. If it is not chal1cnged within 14 days it becomes a legal document. Imeandikwa katika ripoti hiyo ya InternalAudit Wilajyani KakamegaWalikuwa wakitafutani nani aliyeiba pesa. Lakini baada ya kujua ni nani aliyekula pesa hizo, mpaka leo hawajachukua hatua yo yiote. Kama mtu huyo angekuwa Bw. Shikuku, redio ya nchi hii ingelia siku tano nzima; "Shikuku, Shikuku, Shikuku, Shikuku" na rnagazsti yote yaugeuzwa. Lakini wao wamekula pesa; basi yatosha. Hiyo ndiyo sheria. tuliyonayo hapa: sheria moja kwa watu fulani na sheria nvingine kwa watu wengine; zote mbili ni tofauti. Mkuu wa Sheria yuko hapa. Ripoti hiyo iiiwekwa juu ya Meza hapa. Manaibu wote wa machifu katika sehemu hiyo wamechukua Sh. 80.224. Mkuu wa Tarafa ali chukua Sh. 106,864 bila ya kutoa supporting documents. Mimi sijui Kliingereza. Lakini niliambiwa na wale wanaofahamu kwamba kama hakuna supporting docu¬ments, pesa hizo zimekwenda tumboni. Lakini mpaka leo hawajafikfehwa kortini. Hiyo ndiyo tunaambiwa kwamba ni "sheria kwa wote", lakini si kwa wote bali ni kwa wengine. Kama ingekuwa ni Mhe. Shikuku angekiona kile kilichomfanya punda asimee pembe. Kwa hivyo, ningependekeza katika Committee stage kuwe na amendment ya kusema kwamba ikiwa account ya mtu itachunguzwa. ni lazima mtu huyo afahamishwc kuhusu jambo hilo ili ajue.Vile vile, Bw. Naibu Spika, nilifikiri kwamba Mkuu wa Sheria afatueleza zaidi kuhusu badiliko linalofanyiwa The Trustees (Perpetual Succession) Act. Lafcini haku fanya hivyo. Lakini mimi siyafahamu yale ninayoyaona hapa. Kama siyafahamu mambo haya basi watu wa Butere hawayafahamu. Kwa hivyo. ningependa Mkuu wa Sheria atueleze kinaganaga kuhusu mambo haya. Sisi ambao si wanasheria tukiyasikia maelezo ya Mkuu wa Sheria .tutakwenda kulq nyumbani na kuwaeleza wainanchi ni sheria gani ambazo tiimezipitisha hapa. That is the things should go.Bw. Naibu Spika, niimesema hapa, na nitarudia tena, kwamba ingefaa sheria ziandikwe kwa lugha inayofaha mika kwa watu wote: yaani lugha ya KiswahilS. Ni lazima mipango ianze kufanywa na vile vile maelezo yatOlewe katika redio. Hii ni kwa sababu wakati mwi¬ngine Bw. Spika husimama na kusema "Waihe. Wabunge, Mfukufu Rais amekubaliana na sheria ambazo mlizi pitisha tarehe zifuaitazo. Yeye ameziweka sahihi sheria hizo." Kwa hivyo, ingefaa sheria hizi zifafsiriwe kwa lugha ya Kiswahili ili wananchi wajue ni sheria gani ambazo zimepitishwa na llunge HILI. Sisi pia kama Wabunge yatupasa kuwaeleza wananchi kuie nyumbani ni sheria nani ambazo zi.mepitishwa ili wasije waka naswa na sheria ambazo sisi huzipitisha hapa. Hii ni kwa sababu wanasheria, na Mkuu wa Sheria mwenvEWE ana jua. husema kwamba "Ignorance is no defence" Ukisema "Sikujua" huko si kujitetea: wewe waenda jela.Bw. Naibu Spika, katika ukurasa wa 283, Mswada huu unazungumza juu ya Pensions (Increase) Act Section 3. Sehemu ya 3 (c) inasema hivi: "(c) Insert at end the following subsections"(2) Proviso (iii) to subsection (1) shall not operatewith rcsnect ito any pension not exceeding sixtypounds per annum."Bw. Naibu Spika. nimefanva hesabu hapa na nimeona kwamba hizo paiini C0na kwa vile pauni moja ina Sh. 2.0 .ni kama Sh. 100 kwa mwezi. Utaona kwamba buvu mtu hupata pensheni ya Sh. 100 kila mwezi. Hizo pauni 60 ni za mtu ambaye hupata Sh. 100 kwa mwezi kama Pension. Hivi mainizi ituliidhinisha katika Bunge hili nvongeza za mishahara kwa waitumishi wa Serikali. Lakini kuna watu wnngine ambao malipo yao ya uzeeni vako chini ya Sh. 100 kwa mwezi. Mimi riinamfahamu mtu mmoia ambaye huliowa Sh. 84 kwa mwezi. Yeye hufezimika kusafiri kutoka nyumbani kwake hadi Mjini Kakamega ili kuzichukua pesa hizo. Kwa hivyo. uta¬ona kwamba hiyo pension vake haina maana. Je, ni jambo garni ambalo unaweza kufanva na Sh. 84? Hata ukienda pale Hotel InterContinental kuiinuniilia cha¬kula cha iioni pesa hizo hazitaweza kununua hata soda.Hakuna kitu ambacho mtu anaweza kufanya na Sh. 84. Laikini utaona kwamba hapa tunamngumza .juu ya £60 per annum ambazo ni sawa na Sh. 100. kwa mwezi. Hakuna kiitu ambacho mtu anaweza kufanva na pesa kama hizo. What can you do with Sh. 1.00? Hi Id ni kiasi kidogo sana cha pesa. Vile vile kuzipata pesa hizi za malipo ya uzeeni ni sftida sana. Kwa hivyo ingefaaminan?o iTanywe ili mtu awe akienda.kuyapokea mTltno .akr; katika ofisi ya "0.0. wa sehemu "yake. .Tpmbo hilo Ifamv.ereshp. mtu kutembea hadi ofisini kwa D O. Vile VITE, ingefaa hava maiipo vaongezwe. Ikiwa Sh 200 iiatuwa a+adhal. Hii "kwa sababu tunapo panrisha bei ra bidhaa hekuna duka la pekee ambapo watu wawaopokea malipo ya uzeeni huenda kununua bidhaa. zao. Bei za bidhaa muhimu hupanda kila siku.Waziri wa Fedha anapoisoma Bajeti katika Bunge hili hasemi ameongeza bei za bidhaa arohazo hutumiwa na watu wenye mapato ya chini; haongezi bei ya unga, viberiti, mafuta ya kupikia, na sukari, na sisi hapa humshangilia na kumpigia makofi.Sasa wananchi wanafurahi wakisema kwamba, "This is a poor mans budget" and yuye anavaa maua mazuri kwa koti lake na huko tunamsifu. lakini baada va miezi mitatu, bei ya sabuni imepanda, bei ya soda imepanda, hei ya hiki imepanda, bei ya kile imepanda, lakini pengine pension ya yule mtu haiongezwi. Wakati huo huo, Waziri aliye na mshahara mkubwa au Mhe. Shikuku, tunapokwenda dukani kununua bidhaa fulani, tunanunua bidhaa hizo kwa bei ile ile inayonunuliwa na yule pensioner maskini. Haki iko wapi? Vitu ambavvo vinanunuliwa kwa wingi na watu maskini vinazidi ku ongezewa bei na yule maskini nia anahitajika kutoa Harambee. Atatoa wapi pesa za Harambee? Yeye hana pesa hata kidogo na kwa hivyo yule kuku wake anaye fuga anachukuliwa kwa Harambee, lile jembe lake pia iinakwenda kwa harambee na pia blanketi. Kitu ambacho hawachukui ni paka na mbwa. Tutaendelea na mchezo huu mpaka lini?Kwa hivyo, tunapoiikiria kuongeza mishahara yetu, tunaofikiria kuongeza mishahara ya wafanvakazi wa Serikali, ni lazima pia tufikirie kuongeza pension kwa sababu yule mtu hajakufa. Hata Waziri wa Wafanya kazi yuko hapa na yeye anakubaliana nami kabisa kwamba pension haipewi maiti.</NEWSPEECH><Newspeech> The Minister for Planning and National Development (Dr. Ouko): On a point of information, Mr. Dputy Speaker, Sir. The Minister for Labour is not really here now.</NEWSPEECH> <Newspeech>Mr. Shikuku: Ahsartte, nafikiri ningesema "alivekuwa Waziri wa Wafanyakazi". Yeve anafahamu wazi kwamba pension haipewi maiti, bali inapewa binadamu na yule binadamu anahitaji kiberiti. mafuta taa, unga, na vitu vingine muhimu katika maisha yake. Lakini vitu hivi vinaongezwa bei kila siku na ile pension haion?ezwi. Hili si jambo linalomhusu Mkuu wa Sheria sasa, bali linamhusu Waziri wa Fedha na ni lazima aansalie ili kupata ni niia gani tunawe:a kuwasaidia hawa pensioners ambao wanapata Sh. 100 kwa mwezi. Wale ambao waliwanatia DESA hizo. wanafahamu wazi kwamba haziwezi kuyatosheleza mahitaji yao ya siku moja na wao wanasema kwamba wansetaka yule mtu aishi maisha maruri akiwa na watoto wake pamoja na bibi vake. Ni lazima mambo hayo vasemwe na tunano yasema, isisemekane kwamba tunaipinga Serikali, haoana. Kazi vetu hana ni kuwakumbusha walio katika VSti vya Mbele ili wasikie. Nasema hivyo kwa sababu wao pia wakati wa kupiga kura, watarud kule nyu mbani. Lakini wale wananchi maskini husahau upesi sana, wangewabwaa wanaporadi kule nyumbani ku omba kura. Siiui ni kwa nini wananchi nao wanasa hau umesi jinsi hii. Pengine wanapatiwa chai kidogo na kusahau. basi shauri venu nvinvi watu wadotro, mngewabwaga hawa watu wanaporudi kule nyumbani wasionekane hapa ili kazi yangu iwe kidogo.Bw. Naibu Spika, jambo lingine linahusu ile back¬dating ya malipo ya pension hadi mwaka wa 1977. Mimi ninaliunga jambo hili mkono ijapokuwa ni pesa kidogo. Tukipitisha sheria hii, pesa hizo zitakuwa jambo kubwa kwa watu wadogo kwa sababu ikiwa malipo hayo yatarudishwa nyuma mpaka mwaka huo wa 1977, hiyo ni miaka karibu nane. Hivyo ni kusema mtu akipata Sh. 100 kila mwezi, itakuwa Sh. 800 na Pengine yule maskini ataweza kununua shati.</NEWSPEECH> <Newspeech> An hon. Member: Per annum not per month.</NEWSPEECH><Newspeech> Mr. Shikuku: Is it per month or per year? Inasemwa hapa, "It shall be deemed to have come into force on 1st July, 1977". It is £60 per annum. If you divide that by 12, you will get Sh. 100 per month. Kwa hivyo, itakuwa Sh. 800.</NEWSPEECH> <Newspeech> An hon. Member: Hiyo nli kidogo sana.</NEWSPEECH><Newspeech> Mr.Shikuku: Ndiyo, hiyo ni kidogo sana, Iaikini kama ingekuwa Sh. 200 ingekuwa Sh. 1,200. Watu wengine hawajaona pesa kama hizo, na kama wangepatiwa pesa hizo, wangeshukuru sana. Lakini hata kama pesa hizo ni kidogo, ni lazima tuishukuru Serikali na nitatumaini kwamba Waziri ataannalia maneno hayo kwa sababu ktiwaongeza Sh. 100 zaidi, haitavunja Sqrikali hii kwa sababu pensioners si wengi sana.Sasa ninuetaka kuja kwa kile kitu kinachoitwa Schedule, katika ukurasa wa 284. Biv. Naibu Spika, nrmi hufanva homework, ninawaornba wanisamehe kama nitaendelea mbele. kidogo. Hapa naona wanasema juu ya The Local Authorities Provident Fund Act (Cap. 272) na wanasema katika 5 (1):Repeal paragrahs (a) and (/) and subsitute thefollowing paragraphs:(a) seven members appointed by the Minister, one to represent each province.Bw. Naibu Spika, ninamshukuru Waziri kwa badiliko hili kwa sababu MIMI nai.penda sana kwa sababu kila mkoa utakuwa na mwakilishi wake. Pia katika (B) ana semaone member appointed by Nairobi City Commis¬sion.Mimi niikuwa nikifikiria kwamba huvu ndiye atai wakilisha Mkoa wa Nairobi kwa sababu geography yawgu inaniambia kwamba Kenya ina mikoa minane na hapa tunapata sababu. Sasa Mkoa wa Nairobi uko wapi? Ninasema hivyo kwa sababu katika (b) wanasema kwamha veve at.achatruiiwa na Nairobi Citv Commis¬sion. Kwa hivyo, kama ingewezeikana badiliko linge f.anvwa ii tuwe na mikna nane na wakiaka kurnweka mtu wa commission, wafanye hivyo. Ninasema hivyo, hata kama stolcj hana Nairobi kwa sababu mimi ni Member of the National Assembly, vaani. ninaanealia Kenya yote bali si Butere peke yake. Kenya ikiwa saama. Butere iko salama. Nineaka Waziri aangalie section 5 (i) katika ukurasa wa 284 ili badala ya kuwa is miknn saba iwe na nane. Mimi sikatai yule wa Nairobi Commission awekwe, lakini ni lazima .Mkoa wa Nairobi uwe na mwakilishi wake.Jambo lingine ninahusu Registered Land Act. Nemo hili "chargor" limekuwa ni makosa ya chapa, lakini Waziri   amelishaihisha, lakini hata hivyo, tunamsh  kuru Waziri kwa kuiona kosa hilo. Jambo ninelotaka kusema juu ya ardhi yaani, registered land ni kwamba; ukweli ni kwamba watu wadogo wnapoteza ardhi yao through land registration. Kaika Butere kwa mfano. ardhi ya watu wengine, ilifanyiwa land registration na kila mtu alipewa nambari yake. Lakini wengine walikuwa hawana pesa za kwenda kuandikisha ardhi yao na kupata cheti cha kumiliki ardhi hiyo, na waliendelea kukaa tu hivyo hivyo. Halafu watu werevu, walikuja na kusema, "Nipatie ardhi kidogo nilime”,basi anapopatiwa, anakwenda kuandikisha ardhi  hiyo  kwa jina  lake na baadaye anakuja na kumwambia mwenye ardhi hiyo, "Wewe .huna ardhi hapa ena".  Kuna  kesi nyingi za ana hii katika Butere na mambo yarnekuwa mabaya sana  Hata  assistant  chief  ameingia  katika  manenohayo   Tulipitisha  mwaka  wa	1981 	kwamba  district officer atakuwa akianzalia mambo hayo, lakini siku hizi, hata  chifu anaangalia  maneno hayo. Waziri  akitaka .nimpatia barua,  ataona  kwa ha chifu anatoa  amrikwa  mtu aondoke  shambani mwake 	I have got this in black and white and this is chaotic!  Maskini wananyn'anywa ardhi yao. Kuna wale ambao wana pesa ambao wanatoa chai kwa wanakamati na ardhi ya mtu inekwenda Mtu anaambiwa "Ondoka kwa ardhi hii" na igawa yeye alizaliwa kule, yule mtu mjanja lifanya mpango na kuandikisha ardhi ile kwa jina lake na obeli cha kumiliki ardhi ile amcpata. Sasa mwenye shamba anaendelea kusema hii ardhi ni yangu na hata nambari yake nikonayo.Nambari haifai,  kwa sababu yule  mtu  amechukua title-deed, na  nitakwenda kumpa  list  ya  watu hawa wote ambao wamenyana'anywa ardhi yao kwa ujanja kama huu. Hawana wa'kili au cho chute, na wale wazee wanaatakiwa kwenda kuma rnanerto haya, uishavvapa ohakula cha kutosha, wako tayari kusema maneno ya uwongo. Hii  ndiyo sababu  nilisema kwamba ingefaa mwenyekiti  wa  Kanu  wa sub-location hiyo, Mbunge wa sehemu hiyo na watt wengine tuwe katika kainati bizi za ardhi.  Maskini wananyanyaswa na kunyanga-nywa ardhi yao.<i>(Applause)<i>Wananchi wananyng'anywa ardhi yao, na  ingefaa Kanu ijitokeze nasi Wabunge tuinzia na kukaa katika kamati hiyo  kwa sababu  kuna mchezo mbaya unanendelea. Waal wengine humbiwa, "Kama h na petroli, siwezi kuyatimiza mataqcwa yako." Kwa hivyo, jambo hill la ardhi hii inayonyang'anywa maskini 'kwa ujanja liana:Uwe. Nita apa list ya watu wa Butere iajua kwamba kuna mahali kwingineko kama Butere ambao wameipoteza ardhi yao bila yao kuwa na habari.</NEWSPEECH><Newspeech> An hon. Member: Hata Wabunge wanaweza kuwa wajanja.</NEWSPEECH> <Newspeech> Mr. Shikuku: Mbunge fulani anasema kwamba hata Wabunge wanaweza kuwa wajanja, lakini hata ikiwa hivyo, wananchi sio wapumbavu. Kura zikifikia wakati wa upigwa, Mbunge mjanja hataliona Plunge tena. Ni  kweli kwamba  wananchi  ni  werevu  sana. Wale waliakuleta hapa wana akili kukushinda wewe tiliyeletwa. Ukifanya ujanja kule nje, wananchi watakuona na tangu wakati huo, utakuwa to ukisikia kwarnba kuna Bunge; utakuwa ukikisikiliza kile kipindi cha radio, "Leo katika Bunge", lakini hutalikanyaga Bunge tens. Mbunge kama buyo haaaingia hapa tena.Mbunge anayeufanya mchezo kama huu anafaa kujua kwamba atakuja  kuondoka Bungeni hill kwa sababu nisi  wengine  tuko  tayari  kumtengenezea  karamu ya kwaheri.  Tutakwenda katika maduka haya yanayouza bidhaa eiliztumiwa, zile za mnada, urnnunulie Mbunge huyo saa ya uktaa kubwa  iliyotumiwa tumpe ndipo aende aitundi:ke  ukutani  mwaka.  Hapo, atakuwa aki-kumbuka kwamba wakati fulani aliauwa Mbunge saa hiyo inapolia, "Ku-ken, .ko-kong, ko-kong." ltayafanya rnakelela hayo kwa ku.wa itakuwa imetumiwa.<i>(Laughter)</i>Kwa  hivyo,  Bw. Naibu  Spika,  sote  katika Bunge hilii ni ndugu, na tunazungumza to wala  hatupigani. Hivyo, ni tazma tuwe tukicheka kidogo na kuzifuralaisha nafsi zeta.Ningependa  Mkuu  wa  S'heria  na hata Waziri wa Ardhi na Makao wauangalie mhezo huu ambao umekuwa mwingi katika Kenya hii. Huu ni mchezo wa kuwanyayasa  na kuwanyang'anya wasiojiweza, yaani maskini, ardhi yao.Jambo lingie, huku nikienda mbele upesi, liko katika ukurasa wa 286 'katika Memorandum of Objects and Reasons. Linasema:"The Provident Fund Act will be amended to allow Kenyans who worked in the General Fund Services of the former East African Community and contributed to its Provident Fund to be paid out from the Kenya Government Provident Fund at the appropriate time and the deposits standing in their names to be paid into the Kenyan Fund."Hiki  ni  kitu  kiuri kwa  sababu watuanahuSika. Ni arriwunga Bw. Mkuu wa Sneria mkono, lakini ningetaka  kujua ni lini watu  hawa wtalipwa. Tuna watu weng wanaahusika wengine  wao wamekwishakufa waqiolcuwa katika community hii. Kuhusu wale waliokufa, waju.kuu an next-of-kin wao watapata pesa hizo. Jambo ,hili la East African Community limewasumbua watt] wengi walokuwa waanvakazi wake na sasa ,hivi hawana matumaini ya kuzipata pesa zao. Lakini, ninaarta  kwamba  matumaini  yapo  katika  Mswada  huu.nintaka   Mkuu  wa   Sheria  atakaposimama kujibu, ,aieleze nimambo  haya yatalcaapofanyika ill niipige arumbeta yangu kule Butere niwaambie watu wangu,  "Kuweni na  matumaini.  Bahati mbaya  kwa walokufa,  lakini  waato  wao  na  mabibi  zao, kama wako 'hai, huenda wakfaidika."Kwa ju la, Bw Naibu Spika, kuna vilungu ambavyo vinabadilishwa katika ukurasa 287 na kuendelea mpaka ukurasa wa 288. Kifungu cha 3 (1) (a) kinasema:"the Savings Bank constituted under the Post Office Savings  Bank Act, and any branch thereof: and(b) for the purposes  of sections  176 and  177 of this Act, any person carrying on banking business in Tanzania or Uganda."  Ninafakiri kwamba katika mabadiliko, kifungu hiki kingewachiliwa mbali. Mswada huu unafaa kubadilishwa, lakini inaonekana kwamba vile ulivyo sasa na hata ukibadilishwa ni sawasawa tu. Kifungu hiki nilichokinakili ndicho kimojawapo kati ya vile vinavyobadilishwa. Ukivangalia Mswada wa Post Office, utaona kwamba hata huo unaitaja Tanzania. Nilifikuwa kwamba Tanzania na  Uganda  zikiondolewa,  huenda  tukayapoteza matuimani  ya  any possible  federation, lakini ningelipenda  Mswada  uwachwe vivyo  hivyo tu kwa sababu wakati wo wote mambo yakiwa mazuri tunaweza kuuruclia ule mtindo wetu wa zamani. Ninaona kwamba Tanzania na Uganda zingali katika mabadiliko tunayoyafanya, lakini  huenda  maneno  haya  yakaja kuwa tofauti baadaye.Kwa haya machache, Bw. Naibu Spika, kwa sababu ninataka kuwapa wenzangu nafasi wazungumze, naunga mkono.</NEWSPEECH> <Newspeech> Mr. Mwakileo: Ahsante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika, kwa kunipa nafasi hii iti niyaseme machache huku nikiuunga mkono Mswada huu. Jambo ambaio nataka kulisema kwa ufupi linahusu mabali pa mawakili hawa. Inone kana ya kwamba </NEWSPEECH> <Newspeech> The Assistant Minister for Environment and Natural Resources (Mr. arap Chebolwo): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I am rising on a point of order on which I think the House will agree with me, that the Mover be now called upon to reply because we are more or less repeating what other Members have already said. So, I move that the Mover be now called upon to reply. I am in order to stand on that point of order.</NEWSPEECH> <Newspeech> Hon. Members: No, no, no. </NEWSPEECH><Newspeech>Mr. Deputy. Speaker: Order, hon. Members. This is covered in the Standing Orders, so I do not see the need For any uprising. I will now put the question, and it is for the House to decide what to do.</NEWSPEECH> <i>(Question, that the Mover be now called upon to reply, put and agreed to)</i><Newspeech> Mr. Abuya-Abuya: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I am seeking your guidance in that this trend of cutting short a debate at an early stage when it has not really matured is catching up too quickly. I accept that the Standing Orders allow this kind of thing, but could we use the good offices of Mr. Speaker to act otherwise, !because sometimes we may have a situation where one or two Members talk, one moving and the other seconding, and that brings a premature situation in the debate. I wonder what will be done in future.</NEWSPEECH>  	 <Newspeech>Mr. Deputy Speaker: I think the good office of the Speaker is being used in that this being a democratically elected assembly, a Motion its raised by an hon. Member and it is put to the House to decide. That is exactly what has happened.</NEWSPEECH> <Newspeech> Mr.  Kivuitu:  On a  point  of  order,  Mr.  Deputy Speaker, Sir. I heard an hon.  Member  shout. "Kaa chini", when you stood up, Was it in order for him to tell you to sit down?</NEWSPEECH> <Newspeech> Hon. Member: Who? Who? </NEWSPEECH> <Newspeech> Mr. Deputy Speaker: Order, order. First of all, this is a very serious thing you have raised, and I must insist to be told who that was.</NEWSPEECH><Newspeech> Mr. Kivuitu:  Well, I cannot say who it was, but somebody shouted, "Kau chini". I do not know whether it was directed to you or to hon. Cheboiwo, but it was shouted.</NEWSPEECH><Newspeech> Mr. Deputy Speaker: Order! Let us not panic.</NEWSPEECH> <Newspeech> Mr. Shikuku: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Whereas I agree with you that the question was put to the House I have no reason to challenge that because the House has decided. I do recall that there were times when the late Humphrey Slade used to refuse the closure. When only two or three people had spoken and he had called another hon. Member to speak and another hon. Member moved a closure, he would say, "Well, I will not take that. I would like to have more people to  speak".  I thought that  could  be used in future to cut down on these closures. We have had that experience here Where the Vice-President and Minister for Home Affairs moved a Motion here, was seconded and a closure was moved even when the question had not been put. Could we have the also take that experience from the rulings of the late Humphrey Slade?  I can dig out instances where the Chair just told the Mover of a closure, "I am not taking your point of order and So-and-so will continue and we will have more debate".</NEWSPEECH><Newspeech>Mr. Kiome: On   a   point   of   order,  Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir </NEWSPEECH> <Newspeech> Mr.  Deputy   Speaker:   Order,  hon.  Kiome.   Mr. Shikuku, I could not agree with you more. The only thing you are missing is that if you are referring to me in the Chair, once upon a time, I refused to put a question of this nature to the House. But it so happens that in this particular occasion, I did concede to put the question, and that is how it is. I mean, you have to look at both sides and not just one side.Can  we continue  now,  Mr.  Attorney-General.Mr.  Kiome:  On a point of   order, Mr.  Deputy Speaker, Sir. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Before you raise your point of order, Mr. Kiome, I have to put it to you that if it is on whether the Mover should now be called upon to reply or not, you may as well sit down.</NEWSPEECH><Newspeech> Mr. Kiome: Sir, it is obliquely or indirectly </NEWSPEECH> <Newspeech> Mr. Deputy Speaker: Whether directly or indirectly, I have told you that if it is anything to do with challenging the ruling whether we should go on or not, we have done away with that. We cannot go on repeating ourselves.</NEWSPEECH> <Newspeech> Mr. Kiome: May I put it this way, Sir. I am seeking your guidance on  a  matter where,  although we are democratic, sometimes we may stand beaten on that principle because the measure is not very exact in the sense that </NEWSPEECH> <Newspeech> Mr. Deputy Speaker: Mr. Kiome, will you sit down? You are raising the same point that I said I cannot allow and, therefore, you are not asking me to give any further guidance on that particular issue.We will go on now.</NEWSPEECH><Newspeech> Mr. Abuya-Abuya: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.</NEWSPEECH><Newspeech> Mr. Deputy Speaker: On the same matter? </NEWSPEECH>	<Newspeech> Mr. Abuya-Abuya: Sir, I was wondering whether hon. sifuna was in order while we know he is a Back-bencher to  sit in the Front Bench merely to  shout at the Back-benchers. Is he in order?</NEWSPEECH><Newspeech> Mr. Deputy Speaker: That is a matter of opinion. Let us continue now.</NEWSPEECH><Newspeech> The Attorney-General  (Mr. Mu1:):  Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I stand here to thank all the hart.  Members who have contributed to this Bill.</NEWSPEECH><i>(There was noise in the House)</i>Sir, there is so much noise I can hardly hear myself.<Newspeech> Mr. Deputy Speaker: Order, hon.  Members. Carry on, Attorney-General.</NEWSPEECH><Newspeech> The Attorney-General  (Mr. Muli): As I was saying Sir, I will start by thanking the hon. Members who contributed to this Bill for the valuable contributions they have made. First of all, I would like to start with and commend on the general comments of hon. Martin Shikoku, and accept that I should explain every aspect of the Act which is being amended?Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as you will notice, I had put in the Memorandum of Objects and Reasons a long explanation of each and every amendment that was being sought. In my supplementary moving notes, I only added and amplified.  There was no necessity to go back and repeat what is in the Memorandum of Objects and Reasons. However, I do accept that in future I will take opportunity to explain because I like explaining.The other point I would like to make is this, that many of these Acts which are being amended in the Miscellaneous (Amendment) Bill do come from various Ministries  and also administered by various different Ministries Therefore, the responsibility of </NEWSPEECH><Newspeech> Mr.  Shikuku:  On  a  point  of  order,  Mr.  Deputy Speaker Sir, there is so much noise that I can hardly follow the Attorney-Generals explanations. Could we have some silence?</NEWSPEECH><Newspeech>Mr.  Deputy Speaker:  Order!  Hon. Members, just consult quietly.</NEWSPEECH><Newspeech> The Attorney-General (Mr. Muli): Sir, I was saying that the Ministries which do administer the Acts which are contained in the Miscellaneous (Amendment) Bills do, in matter of fairness, assist the Attorney General in the explanations in respect of their own respective Acts. In this respect, I would like to give an example of the Pensions Laws (Miscellanoeus Amendment) Bill or the Customs (Amendment) Bill,  which  could have come out very clearly in the Memorandum of Objects and Reasons or on my supplemental or any other Ministers, but, unfortunately, we could not have so many Ministers or  Assistant  Ministers  or  any  other  hon. Members speaking because a decision has been taken. However, I undertake that in future I will be gibing more explanations in respect of  each and  every one of the Bills.Sir, I do  accept  the  suggestion  of  raising  of the percentage  of interests  on  costs, and I think that is a good suggestion that the percentage on costs should be on commercial basis, We will arrange it so that at Committee stage, instead  of having 12 per cent, we will come up with 14 per cent which is more or less the current valueOn the comments of adding judges and employing advocates within the system of prosecution, I would like to say that that is a very good suggestion  But we do not have many of them. Many of them are defaulting. We try to recruit but, as soon as we do recruit, many of them are tempted into where they get more money, and that is private practice. Having gone into private practice, they end up stealing and by so doing, we end up by knocking them off and blocking them up. In other words, the output from the university every year is  about 70.  If in  a  year,  we  are  having 50 struck off, we are not moving at all.So, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we will continue to use thepolice prosecutors until such time that we have recruited sufficient advocates who will shoulder the responsibility of prosecution right down to the magistrate level. As you are aware, the Attorney-General is responsible for all  prosecutions  right  from  the  high  court  to  the magistrates courts. Due to the shortage of advocates in my office, I cannot spread  them to reach all  the magistrates courts in the Republic. So, until such time as  we will have recruited many lawyers as prosecutors, we will continue to use the police prosecutors. The suggestion was made that efforts be made so that we can recruit more advocates and make them stable within the institution and be allocated to the courts.Other comments which hon.  Members have made have been taken and noted, and will be implemented. There will be one or two amendments at Committee stage for certain aspects which were found necessary.With those few remarks, I beg to move.</NEWSPEECH>	<i>(Question put and agreed to)(The Bill was read a Second The and committed to a 	Committee of the whole House tomorrow)<i><i>Second Reading<i><Header>THE PENSIONS LAWS (AMEND ENT) BILL </Header>	<Newspeech>The Minister for Finance (Prof. Saitoti): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move that the Pensions Laws (Amendment) Bill be read a Second Time.This Bill is purely straightforward and I am, therefore, not going to unnecessarily take the time of this House in spelling out what is said. It suffices to say that there are basically three objectives that are intended to be achieved through this amendment. The first one has to do with the incorporation and implementations of the recommendations contained in the Ramtu Commission which looked into :the terms and services of civil servants. What is recommended in this particular respect is that officers can now retire once they attain the age of 45 and having worked for 10 years. Now, this requirement was not there before and we basically want to ensure that the recommendation is put there.The other one has to do with the simplification in the cases of some officers who, probably, may have worked in the Civil Service for 10 years or more. As the law is today, the requirement is that they must give a notice of three months. In the recommendations contained in the amendment, it is being proposed that one months notice will suffice. So that is the second aspect.The third one in the recommendation is the amendment to make the pension, in as much as it affects the hon. Members of this House, much more realistic. In this respect, what is being proposed is that hon. Members of Parliament actually qualify for pension, so long as they will have sat for two terms, with an aggregate of five years. This represents the gist of this Bill. As I said I do not wish to take the time of the hon. House by going into the Bill detail by detail because it is purely straightforward. I would like to urge the hon. Members to make their contributions so that we may be able to pass this Bill without wasting time.With those few remarks, I beg to move. 	The Minister for Planning and National Development  (Dr. Ouko): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I arise to second the Bill before the House. As the Minister for Finance has stated very clearly, the Government of Kenya is committed to the improvement of the welfare of public servants, as well as that of the hon. Members of Parliament. The intentions of the Bill are clearly spelt out in the Memorandum of Objects and Reasons.With those few remarks, I beg to second.</NEWSPEECH><i>(Question proposed)</i><Newspeech> Mr. Kiome:  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me a chance to say something on this Bill, pant of which I support and parts of which are not supportable. A man’s pension is all that remains to him after he has worked. It is not a gift but a right, so that the person who has worked for so many years is rewarded for all the years so that he does not end up poor. With that in mind, we should consider this a very important as it affects the lives of many Kenyans now and thereafter.Sir, some of us here may become pensioners. In fact, a good number of hon. Members have already qualified to become pensioners. However, there is one aspect of the calculation of the pension which I have always found to be wrong, and the ton. Minister for Finance will tell me why that is so. Somebody may start by being a Minister in the House   and eventually end up as a Back bencher, and   the pension  is calculated on  his last income. The pension is not paid by what one achieved at one time, so that the payments can be higher. A civil servant who is a middle level  graduate moves all the way to become a Permanent Secretary, and his pension is calculated on the basis of the last salary earnings.You will find that this aspect is really wrong and it should have been done away with. The Minister here should have rectified this anomaly. To that extent the civil servants are different from other servants. I thought that lion. Members of Parliament are public servants, as they work for the public of this country. Therefore, they should expect equal treatment.By these words, I should not be mistaken to be saying that the civil servants are privileged in this Bill. In fact, the Bill has since given the civil servants a raw deal, not what they used to get in the past. The civil servants were better off before the introduction of this Bill. I can for now point out one part of the Bill which was formerly a rule, because as it is, the old rules that existed were renewed every five years. They were an experiment which was supposed to be renewed every five years.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, even this Bill is supposed to be an experiment op to the year 1990. We do not know whether there will be a Parliamentary Session in 1990 and there maybe Recess at that time. I am not saying there will be no Parliament as such. What I mean is that the House may have adjourned.</NEWSPEECH><Newspeech> The Assistant Minster for Finance  (Mr. Echakara): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. The hon. Member has made a very serious allegation that he is not sure whether there will be a Parliament in 1990. Can he substantiate that remark by telling us why he has such doubts?</NEWSPEECH><Newspeech> Mr. Kiente: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir,   I do not think the Assistant Minister got me right. In fact, I am going to repeat the same words again. We are not sure whether when this Bill expires in 1990 there will be a Parliament, because Parliament can be prorogued for quite sometime before an election is held.</NEWSPEECH><Newspeech> The Minister for Energy and Regional Development (Mr. Biwott): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. We would like the hon. Member to be categorical on this point. We always assume that everything will be normal. So, if there is going to be abnormality in future, and the hon. Member is sure about it, could he tell us so that we can face the situation squarely?</NEWSPEECH><Newspeech> Mr. Kiome:  I do not think there will be anything abnormal, but when Parliament is prorogued, there is no Parliament. That is a normal situation.</NEWSPEECH><Newspeech> The Minister for Planning and National Development (Dr. Ouko): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.  When Parliament is prorogued, it is stated that Parliament is prorogued, but  Parliament remains in existence. So, when the hon. Member states categorically that there may be no Parliament, it means something different, but not prorogation or, adjournment.</NEWSPEECH><Newspeech> Mr. Deputy Speaker: Order! Order! I think to bring this debate to an end, hon. Kiome, you should accept this unfortunate statement that you made because when Parliament is dissolved, the Speaker remains in these buildings.  He forms  the  continuation of Parliament because he sits with the mace in these buildings. So, I think you better leave that argument and withdraw the remarks. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>Mr. Kiome: Let us put it this way: Let us leave that alone and put it in a different way. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>The Minister for Energy and Regional Development (Mr. Biwatt): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. We take this matter very seriously and I think the hon. Member </NEWSPEECH><Newspeech> Mr. Kiome: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think </NEWSPEECH><Newspeech> Mr. Deputy Speaker: Order! Sit down, Mr. Kiome.</NEWSPEECH> 	<Newspeech> The Minister for Energy and Regional Development (M. Biwatt): The hon. Member should be a responsible Member of Parliament as we are. It is a very serious thing to contemplate non-existence of Parliament when 	we are in a democratic country. Anyone of us might not be there at that time because we can be voted out by wananchi anytime.  We believe in justice. I think here the reasoning by hon. Shikuku is good. We believe in justice and that we will be moving in and out of Parliament. But this institution shall always be here. We do not want to be taken for a ride. We are taking this issue very, very seriously. So, it is in fact for the hon. Member if he notes something that we are not aware of to tell us. If that is not the case, then he should consider it as an unfortunate statement. So he should withdraw the remark and apologize accordingly and unconditionally,</NEWSPEECH><Newspeech> Mr. Kiome: Even though what my friend is saying is not what I meant, I beg to withdraw that Statement and then continue. While continuing, the situation</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>The Minister for Finance (Prof. Saitoti): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think what hon. Kiome has stated is something unfortunate. We demand that he should actually apologize to the House apart from withdrawing the statement.  Having made that unfortunate and offensive statement in this august House, it behaves him to actually apologize to this House if if he is quite clear that he did not mean to make that statement.</NEWSPEECH><Newspeech> Mr.  Kiome:   Mr.  Deputy  Speaker, Sir, I  thought when Parliament is dissolved there is no Parliament. Although I am a lawyer, my friends have become better lawyers. But let me withdraw that statement and apologize just to satisfy them.</NEWSPEECH><i>(Laughter)</i><Newspeech> Mr. Deputy Speaker: Order!  Hon. Kiome, there isno question of satisfying anybody. Your apology must be unconditional.</NEWSPEECH><Newspeech> Mr. Kiome: I withdraw the statement and apologize, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I am almost feeling compelled to take one of my friends on an allegation of irresponsibility, but </NEWSPEECH> <Newspeech> Mr. Shikuku: On a  point  of  order, Mr.  Deputy Speaker, Sir. We are here to uphold the Standing Orders of this House with the assistance of the Chair, of course.I thought I heard hon. Biwott saying that a Member of Parliament should be responsible. He therefore imputed that the hon. Member was not responsible. If that is so, that is wrong because you cannot impute improper motive to an hon. Member who is speaking. Was that in order?</NEWSPEECH><Newspeech> The Minister for Energy and Regional Development (Mr. Biwott): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am the one who said that the hon. Member should be responsible. Indeed, hon.  Members  should he responsible.  I am personally responsible for my utterances whether I utter them here or outside. This is because I should know what I am doing or saying. To say that Parliament will not be there is something that I feel that surely somebody should take full responsibility for and say whether it is so or not so. So, there was no question of imputing any improper motive on anybody.</NEWSPEECH><Newspeech> Mr. Shikuku: On a  point  of  order, Mr.  Deputy Speaker, Sir. I can see that we are trending on a very, very dangerous ground. Immediately you allow me to have an opinion that hon. Biwott is responsible or irresponsible, then I will be imputing improper motive on his part. The question is whether what he said is wrong or not. With regard to what has taken place, you have already ruled that hon. Kiome should withdraw and apologize. But that does not render the hon. Member irresponsible.</NEWSPEECH><Newspeech> The Minister for Planning and National Development (Dr. Ouko): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. There are two facts that  we have to  take into account. First of all, we have to take into account what the hon. Member said that there maybe no Parliament in 1990. The Constitution of this country states that there shall be a Parliament. It does not say that there shall be a Parliament every five years, but it says that Kenya is a Parliamentary democracy and there shall be a Parliament. I do not think hon. Biwott was imputing any improper motive on the hon. Member. He was challenging the statement which was made by an hon. Member of this House who made an assertion that there maybe no Parlament. That is ultra vire to the Constitution.</NEWSPEECH><Newspeech> Mr. Shikuku: On a   point  of  order, Mr.  Deputy Speaker, Sir. I am raising this mater as a number of principle. I am not defending the statement that was made. I am only raising a matter of principle, an hon.Member is not allowed to say in respect of another hon. Member. "That one is irresponsible". I have heard a rulng being made on such a statement. Until such a time that the Speaker rules that What an hon. Member has said is  irresponsible, no either hon. Member can say that the been. oleague is irresponsible. But when an hon. Member is uttering the words, I am not supposed to tell trim that he is irresponsible or that his intentions are evil. These are sort of Parliamentary procedures that we haw had here. You cannot impute an improper motive on another hon. Member or say thee the intentions of another Member are irresponsible other day, somebody said in his House, "Oh, this is said to catch the headlines in the newspapers". That was imputing an improper motive on the other hon. Members. I am giving that as an example, So.  I am not concerned with Hon. Kiome’s statement at all. Leaving his statement aside, I  am talking, about the question of imputing improper motive on one another, but  I am not concerned with his statement.</NEWSPEECH><Newspeech> The Minister for Energy and Regional Development (Mr. Biwott): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.I think hon. Shikuku should also understand that we understand English as well;  just as much as himself. There is no imputation; mine is categorical. It is explicit. There is nothing imputed in it.All I was saying is, in fact, nothing more than is contained in Standing Order 76 which says: "A Member shall be responsible for the accuracy of his own statements".So, all I have asked is that if an hon. Member knows about something, he should tell us. He should be responsible enough to accept his own statement. I do not see how you impute anything with that one, because to impute is to put something explicitly as anything. It is a simple thing.</NEWSPEECH><Newspeech> Mr. Abuya-Abuya: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. If that is what the hon. Minister meant, then he should have stood on a point of order and apply that rather than what he said, which is directly implying improper motive or imputing improper motive on the hon. Member who was on the Floor.</NEWSPEECH> <Newspeech> Mr.  Deputy Speaker:  Order! When the Minister actually uttered the words, hon. Members of course, must bear in mind that he was on a point of order; and so, the chair does not find that there was an irregularity in so far as the Standing Order is concerned in that this is a factual matter which the hon. Ministers here were trying to draw out of hon. Kiome on the "factualness" of his feeling that there might have been something irregular coming. So, I think at that point, let him go on.at </NEWSPEECH><Newspeech> The Minister for Planning and National Development (Dr. Ouko): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Are we in order to continue with this debate when the Chair had already requested hon. Kiome to accept that  this   was   an   unfortunate  statement  coming from the speaker and the matter has been resolved; he  has  apologized and withdrawn? Is it not in order for us to continue with our debate?</NEWSPEECH><Newspeech> Mr.  Deputy Speaker: I think so that we do not engage in another debate or sub debate, hon. Shikoku was quite in order to raise what he saw as his interpretation. But we have finished that bit as well. Can you continue, hon. Kiome.</NEWSPEECH><Newspeech>Mr. Kiome: Thank you, Mr.  Deputy Speaker.	When I was interrupted, I was saying that in 1990 is about time when this Act will cease to be an experiment and then there will be no Act. This means that a person who as now worked for ;about five years will have reached ten years in Government service but he cannot benefit from the ten-year rule dust because at that time there will be no Act. This means he will have to continue to reach 45 years. This only happens becaue this Act combines 45 years and 10 years, but rules out the possibility of one getting out of the service  before he is 45 years.Let us take the case, Mr. Deputy Speaker, of a person who gets into the service at the age of 20. He starts service at the age of 20 and he would like to 	retire after about ten years of service to go and engage 	in some other employment. He is a professional like hon. kivuitu and he is admitted as a lawyer at age 20. He would like to serve the Government for only ten years and then leave space or room for younger persons to come into employment. So, what will happen is that hon. Kivuitu will have to stay until he is 45 years. He will have to work in that office for 25 years and he would like to retire at about 30 because it is a profession. But by holding him until he is 45 to retire when he is not productive although in our service people like thinking that they are productive When they are old that is contrary to our idea of generating employment, getting more people employed by people retiring early, and it is contrary to people benefiting tram gainful employment when they are very healthy, particularly if they are very productive. In some areas like doctors, lawyers, valuers, and so on, most of them would like to leave the Government service very early. They start their service at 25 or 26, and by the age of 40, they retire as senior persons only to leave space to new and up-coming professionals.So, by holding these people for 45 years, they are themselves suffering and we are closing room for employment. Secondly, we are making a person who has worked for six years, or nine years and has only one year left before he can retire under the ten-year rule to stay in Government service until he is 45 years old. He is not going to benefit from the ten-year rule.So, Sir, I am suggesting that we remove the word "and" and put the word "or", so that it reads, "forty-five years or ten years of service". That will do a lot of good to both parties. It will not only do good to the  Government  which will  get  very young people working and going out of the service when they are still vigorous and leaving others to work but also to the young person Who wants to go and work elsewhere. So, I would to request the hon. Minister to look into that aspect of the Bill and find out Whether this was an error or a deliberate legislation, an oversight or whether it is something that is going to benefit the Civil Service of this country or the few individuals. So I would like Ito request that this idea of people losing their eight or nine years when they are about  to reach the ten-year rule should be looked into and the word "or" substituted. In fact, Sir, if I had more time, I would have moved that amendment in the normal way. However, I think the Minister will see to it and remove that part of it.Another part of the Bill, Mr. Deputy Speaker, which is not only unfair to the Civil Service but also to the politician </Newspeech>  <Newspeech> The Assistant Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr.  Michuki):  On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker.  Sir,  in  so far  as this  is  concerned,  is  it correct for anyone to assume that the draft Bill makes compulsory for one  to retire at the age of 45, it I understand the hon. Member correctly? That is what he is saying. This is voluntary retirement, but he is giving us the impression that 45 years of age is compulsory retirement. This is voluntary as far as I understand the Bill. </NEWSPEECH><Newspeech> Mr. Deputy Speaker: Order! You have not raised any point of lelirder, ibut you are giving your interpretation of what the Bill is intended to do.Can you continue, Mr. Kiome.</NEWSPEECH><Newspeech> Mr. Kiome: Yes, he was advancing an argument Maybe be will have time to speak on the Bill tomorrow.However, Sir, you will realize that we are depriving some people of their rightful years which they have already worked and they would like to get out.Sir, another part of the Bill which I said was quite unfair is to the politicians. If a politician achieves the age of 45 years and he has served for ten years, or two consecutive terms of service, he cannot get his pension. He will Stay until he is 55 years of age. </Newspeech><Newspeech> The Assistant Minister for Finance (Mr. Echakara): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Sir, the point of order that I am raising is based on Standing Order No. 87 which talks about repetitions and president irrelevance. Hon. Kiome has repeatedly and consistently talked of irrelevant parts of this Bill. May I know from the Chair whether hon. Kiome is not violating standing Order No. 87? </NEWSPEECH><Newspeech> Mr. Deputy Speaker: No! Order! You have not said what he said and when he said it which he has repeated, as you are alleging.  So, I do not know what you are referring to.</NEWSPEECH><Newspeech> Mr. Kiome: Mr. Deputy Speaker, whereas others can retire at 45 years of age, the politician who does not come to this House after those ten years, or two consecutive terms, cannot draw his pension until he is 55  years of age.  As you	know Sir, Members work under a lot of pressure </NEWSPEECH><Header>ADJOURNMENT </Header><Newspeech> Mr. Deputy Speaker: Hon.  Members it is time for the interruption of business.

Idara ya Utawala inahusika to katika juhudi za kuhakikisha kwamba kuna usalama wa kutosha wakati mashamba katika lokesheni hii yanaanclikishwa.Jibu kuhusu sehemu ya pili ya swali ni, la.

Spika,  vile ninavyofahamu ni kwamba  mnamo  tarehe 13 March, 1985  sehemu  ya Kimorigo Location ifitangazwa kuwa mahali pa kuandikishwa  kwa  mashamba,  yaani  land  adjudication area. Wakati kazi hii ilipoanza, malalamiko yalipokewa kwamba  chifu  wa  lokesheni hiyo  anaingilia  kazi  ya uandikishaji  via mashamba.  Alionywa  kuhusu jambo hill na tangu wakati huo. hatujasikia malalamiko mengine kuhusu jambo hili. Kazi hii ya uandikishaji wa mashamba inaendeshwa na Kamati ya Uandikishaii wa rnashamba, yaani Land Adjudication Committee ambayo  inaongozwa  na  wazee na  maofisa  wa  Idara  ya Uandikishaji wa Mashamba, yaani Land Adjudication Department. Kuala wakati huu, kesi 10 zimendikishwa kutoka Kimorigo Adjudication Area na kutoka pahali pengine paitwapo Kimalamata ambano kesi 108 zimeandikishwa.Huko  Mbogoni kazi  hii ya  uandikishaji katika  sehemu  hizo,  ulianza  tarehe 13  Machi. 1985 kama nilivyosema hapo mbeleni.Sasa Bw.

Kwa mfano, katika sehemu yetu ya Narok, Mhe.

The same night, alt about 14 p.m.. Mr. Anthony Ndurg’u Glaikari  reported that he had been attacked by three people along the same road. The police officers requested Mr. Ndong’u Gaikaria to accompany them to the scene of robbery. They requested him to walk ahead and when the reached the niece where he had been robbed,  he started  running back to the police officers shouting that the robbers were still there and had ordered him to stop. The police officers rushed to the scene ordering the suspects  to  stop, but they ran away without obeying, she warning. Two shots were fired in the air before the deceased was shot and died instantly.An inquest file was placed before the Senior Resident Magistrate. at Machakos, namely, Inquest File No. 15 of 1984. The magistrate gave the order that an open inquest he held. Unfortunately, the witnesses were not bonded in time, so the inquest file was closed without the inquest being held. The Officer Commanding Police Division, Machakos, has already been requested to see the magistrate at Machakos and request that a new day be set for the inquest to be held.Mr. Speaker, I took quite a bit of trouble to go into this matter and from the facts as they are now, it appears that the inquest was not properly hold due to the delay of the witnesses appearing to give evidence before the magistrate.  Now  having discovered that, I have ordered that a new inquest be held and I would request the hon. Member to help the authorities concerned by asking anybody who has any evidence to dye to go and give it so Watt whoever is implicated by the death of the deceased could be dealt with.</NEWSPEECH><Newspeech> Mr.  Kikuyu:  Mr.  Speaker,  although the  Minister has given a very lengthy reply to my supplementary question, this question was intended for him to assure the House that the police at Athi River Police Station will not be involved in this inquest. You cannot imagine a man being told that he is waylaying his brother. The deceased was corning to help  his  brother  who was being robbed by the robbers, and you cannot imagine somebody saying his brother killed him on a robbery basis. Moreover the police tried to hide those facts and said that they found the decreased brother with dubs and other weapons as if that means he was the robber, but this is not a fact. Could the Minister assure us that all  the  police officers  at  Athi  River Police Station, those who were there then, will be taken as suspects in this case?</NEWSPEECH><Newspeech> Mr. ole Tipis: Mr. Speaker, first of all, let us clear the air Some people can be the worst enemies to their brothers. We have had cases of people murdering their brothers, like the 42 brothers Who are well known.Having said that Sir, lot  me assure the House that if we held to go by the first inquest, there would have been no need to request for the new inquest which I have now ordered to be carried out. I did this in good faith So that those policemen who were involved are nowhere near investigating the case. We will have a new team of investigators altogether.</NEWSPEECH><Header> REPARING OF SOTIK-C HEBI LAT -NYANSIONGO ROAD </Header><NEWSPEECH> Mr. Onyancha: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Transport and communications the following Question by Private Notice:(a) What is the name of the contractor now repairing 	the Salk-Chelbilat-Nyansiongo Road?(b) How much is the contractor to he paid when 	he completes his job?(c) Towards what standard of repair is the contractor	instructed to repair the road? </Newspeech><NEWSPEECH> The Assistant Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr. Keriri): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.</NEWSPEECH>(a) The contractor of the road is Crescent Construction Limited.(b) The contract for the Kisili-Sotik Road, which is the road for which the contract is meant, its for Sh. 5.6 million.(c) As for repairs, just to explain before  I answer that particular pant of the question, the road is being re-sealed. Before re-sealing there are certain repairs that have got to be carried out, such as refilling potholes, strengthening the shoulders, and so -on, after which re-sealing is done. These repairs are being done by the Ministry  engineers and  staff.  The re-sealing of the road is being done by the contractor„ Crescent Construction Limited. The standard to which the road is being done is that we are doing a single seal, that is, one coat of re-sealing. </Newspeech><NEWSPEECH> Mr. Onyancha: Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I ask the question, may I know from the Assistant Minister whether the actual re-sealing has started at any point on this road yet ?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH> Mr. Keriri: Mr. Speaker, we have done about  23 kilometres from Sotik, and I think if I might, probably, anticipate  another reaction  by the Member I should say that this re-sealing that has been done on the 23  kilometres from Sotik was done before he diversion of the Istombasa Rwanda traffic which was previously using the road through Uganda. When trouble stainted in Uganda, the Governments of Kenya and Rwanda agreed that we fake the Rwanda traffic through When that traffic started can that road, it turned out to be heavier than was originally imagined. So, in 	fact, the re-sealing we had done it was only one coat  has been tremendously damaged, and we are now in the process of  consulting the Treasury with a view to finding money not only to re-seal now because re-sealing will not do but to do a complete recarpeting or  over lay of that road we had decided to re-seat. We want to do it on a more permanent standard than what we had decided earlier.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH> Mr. Michoma: Mr. Speaker, Sir, arising from that very unsatisfactory reply from the Assistant Minister, is he aware that the re-sealing he is talking about is noteven an inch as he says, and that potholes on that road are net covered at all? Last time when this same question was asked, the Minister assured the House, when he rose on a point of order, that he would visit the road. Has he done that in order to save public money?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH> Mr. Keriri: First of all, Sir, one thing is that this question was not in this House the day the hon. Member raised his point of order. However, I can assure him that I shall find time to visit that area. In fact, our own provincial engineer is the one that reported to us that it is no use continuing re-sealing this particular road because it is being damaged by the Rwanda traffic. He has asked us to consult the Treasury so that he can do a more permanent job. So, it is not a question of us giving an unsatisfactory answer; it is that we had done a standard job which, because of unexpected traffic, has now been almost nullified. We are now trying to do a better job. As for visiting this area, we shall try to find time to go and visit our brothers in Kisii and we hope that we will be received there when we have time.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH> Mr. Speaker: May I remind hon. Members that we have only one hour and we are now remaining with about 45 minutes, and we have 15 Questions by Private Notice. So, could we have shorter questions and also shorter answers but to the point, otherwise we shall not even go half-way.Let us move  on  to  Mr.  Galgallo’s  Question by Private Notice.</NEWSPEECH><HEADER> LOSS OF TELEGRAPHIC MONEY ORDER </HEADER><NEWSPEECH> Mr. Galgallo:  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Transport and Communications the following Question by Private Notice:(a) Is the Minister aware that Mr. Abdi Ibrahim sent 	KSh. 200  from  Nairobi  by  telegraph  moneyorder to Mrs. Buke Gufu of  Box 15 Moyale,10th July, 1985, who has not received the money up to now? (b)(What action did the Kenya Pasts and Telecommunications take since Mr. Abdi had reported the matter to them?(c) Will he order the corporation to repay the money 	to Mr. Abdi with interest for the period it waswith them  or  to refund the commission  and telegraph  charges  since  the  services  were  not rendered as requested?</NEWSPEECH> <NEWSPEECH>  The Assistant Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr.  Keriri): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am terribly sorry that we noticed this question rather late. We had sent for information from the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation, but by the time I left my office the information had not come. So, I would like to apologize. I will try and get the answer next time.</NEWSPEECH><HEADER> ALLOCATION OF LAND BY GATURA 	CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETY </HEADER><NEWSPEECH> Mr. Abuya-Abuya: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Co-operative Development the following Question by Private Notice:(a) Why was a letter dated 5th May, 1982, addressed to the District Co-operative Officer, Nyandarua, by Messrs. Paul Matundura Osoro, John Batasi and Joseph Onchaga Mareira, all members and shareholders of Gatura Co-operative Savings and Credit Society, whose subject was allocation of land by the society to its shareholders not been responded to?(b) When will the society honour its obligations to these members? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH> The  Assistant  Minister for Co-operative  Development (Archbishop Ondiek): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(a) The letter dated 5th May, 1982, written by Messrs. Paul   Matundura   Osoro,  John  Batasi  and  Joseph Onchaga Mareira, all members of Gatura Co-operative Savings and Credit Society, and addressed to the Co-operative  District  Officer, Nyandarua, among others, was not replied to owing to an oversight. But despite the fact that no formal reply was sent to the writers, arrangements were made to hold a general meeting to brief the members on the affairs of the society. The meeting was held in October, 1982.(b) The society has been unable to purchase a farm for its members, and arrangements are under way to refund members their money.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH> Mr. Abuya-Abuya: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if this letter was not  responded to could  the Assistant  Minister admit, therefore, that there is inefficiency and negligence of duty by this officer and by the commssioner himself since this letter was also to him? Can he accept that there is inefficiency in his office?</NEWSPEECH> <NEWSPEECH> Archbishop Ondiek: Sir, the question of inefficiency does not arise. My officers decided to organize a general meeting so that the people could be informed of the action which had been taken.</NEWSPEECH> <NEWSPEECH> Mr.  Abuya-Abuya:  Mr.  Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister give a definite date when these people will be refunded their money and also say whether that money will be paid with interest? </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH> Archbishop Ondiek: Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is just a question of the refund of money which was paid for the purchase of a farm. So, the question of interest does not arise.</NEWSPEECH> <NEWSPEECH> Mr. Kikuyu: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant  Minister  in  order  to  say  that  the question of interest of people’s money which has been held by the society for a period  of  time does not	arise? Is it fair for him to say that when the money has  been earning interest from the bank? </Newspeech><Newspeech>Mr. Speaker: That is really not a point of order: it is a question. Mr. Kisuya’s Question by Private Notice.</NEWSPEECH><Header>PAYMENT SYSTEM USED BY DEPOTS OF CEREALS BOARD   </Header>	<Newspeech>Mr.  Kisuya:  Mr.  Speaker, Sir, I beg  to  ask the Minister for Agriculture  and Livestock  Development the following Question by Private Notice:(a)Why is it that whenever ,wananchi  deliver maize and other produce for sale to National Cereals and   Produce  Board   at  buying   centres,  e.g. Chwele-Malchonge, et cetera, no receipt for the produce is given even when there is money for payment?(b) would  the  Minister  make  sure  that  original 	delivery  receipts  are given  to  farmers?(c) Would he also consider, as a matter of urgency to buy flat, round weighing machines readable by  old  men  and  women  whenever  maize  is weighed?</NEWSPEECH> <NEWSPEECH> The Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Livestock Development (Mr.  Mwicigi):  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.(a) At the buying  centre, the  board  issues a  crop purchase voucher at the point of grain acceptance on which the  weight  of each  lot  of  maize  received  Is shown, the name and identity of the farmer indicated. Then the farmer proceeds to  the  cashier where  lie exchanges  the crop purchase slip with cash.  In case there are delays in delivering cash to the buying centre, the farmer retains the slip until he has redeemed it with cash.(b)The system of surrendering the crop purchase voucher  for cash  was  introduced  in  order to avoid fraud. The cashier must produce original vouchers to the auditors to prove that he has paid the farmer.(c) The  board  operates  over 	500  buying  centres throughout the country, and each is equipped with flat-form weighing scales, the working of which all farmers are  familiar with.  Hence, there  is no  need to  buy another type of weighing scales. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH> Mr.  Kisuya:  Mr.  Speaker, Sir, the reply by  the Assistant  Minister  makes me wonder because when Muhoroni farmers deliver their produce they are not given any slips at all. When they deliver the produce they are then told to go away and the officials at the receiving centres later come to claim that the farmers had been paid but there are no receipts given to the farmers for their produce. Why is that so?</NEWSPEECH> <NEWSPEECH> Mr. Mwicigi: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the farmers take the purchase  vouchers  which  are  actually,  receipts.</NEWSPEECH> <NEWSPEECH> Mr.  Sifuna:  Mr.  Speaker, Sir, the hon.  Assistant Minister  has  made  a  very misleading report.  It is true that farmers are not given these receipts. In fact, on Monday this  week farmers in Bungoma  District were complaining, until they had to go and see the Bungoma District Commissioner over the same issue. Up to now, the board has even confirmed that over KSh. 5 million has not been paid to the farmers. Some of the farmers have not even been given receipts. Can the hon. Assistant Minister  investigate  the  matter seriously with a view to ensuring that farmers are given receipts for their produce and subsequently paid their dues without further delay?</NEWSPEECH> <NEWSPEECH> Mr. Mwicigi: We  will  do  that, Mr.  Speaker, Sir. </NEWSPEECH> <NEWSPEECH> Mr. Speaker Let us go to Mr. Mwakileo’s question.</NEWSPEECH> <Header>ANCHORAGE SPACE FOR DIANI FISHERMEN  </Header><Newspeech>Mr. Mwakileo kumwuliza Waziri wa Utalii na Wanyama wa Porini Swai Maalum lifuatalo:(a) le, Waziri anaj  a ya kwamba wavuvi wa Dianihawana pahaa pa kuweka madam yao hasa hapo karibu na Kongo Mosque?(b)Anaweza kuwapa sehemu fie ya bandari ya uvuvi kihalali  ili wananehi waepukane  na  kushikwa na polisi? </Newspeech><NEWSPEECH> Mr. Speaker:  Mr.Mwakileo not in?

My Ministry has encouraged local authorities to  set up engineering  departments that would undertake regular repairs.  Finance has been a major constraint and many municipalities have concentrated the available resources on the provision of essential services like public health and primary education.</NEWSPEECH> <NEWSPEECH> Mr. Ayah: Mr. Speaker, Sir.

My Ministry has encouraged local authorities to set up engineering  departments that would undertake regular repairs.  Finance has been a major constraint and many municipalities have concentrated the available resources on the provision of essential services like public health and primary education.</NEWSPEECH> <NEWSPEECH> Mr. Ayah: Mr. Speaker, Sir, arising from the Assistant Ministers reply, and in view of the fact that he said there are no emergency funds in his Ministry to help Kisumu Municipality; and further in view of the fact that  most  of  these municipalities,  particularly Kisumu Municipality, have no funds of their own and no sources of revenue  for  these  major works:  how does the Ministry intend to help? Obviously the roads are now in a very bad state. Does the Assistant Minister have any idea how these municipalities will repair the roads?</NEWSPEECH> <NEWSPEECH> Mr. Kimemia:  Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the case of Kisumu  Municipality the  estimated  cost  for  repair would amount to about KSh. 10 million. This council had operated on bank overdrafts since  1975 and the position started to improve in the recent past, that is 1984 and 1985.

Kirior  on 21st  November, 1985. In my runty to Parliamentary Question No. 504 on 10th October. 1985, I informed the House about the number of Kenyans understudying expatriates in the Agro-Chemical Food Company, Muhoroni. These included Mr. H. 0. Handi, Mr. A. Gumo. Mr. F. Ruto, Mr. F. Achola, Mr. M. Welula, Mr. K. Kilaho, Mr:A. Nyiali and Mr. A. Mnjama.Following the tabling of a letter from the same eight Kenyans denying the issue.  I immediately instituted investigations to determine the actual position. It is evident that the company gave misleading information as regards the Kenyans understudying the expatriates. On this aspect, I am in the process of asking appropriate action against the company. I have now confirmed that the Kenyans   understudying  the  expatriates  are  as follows:  Mr. Frederick Achola, who was initially reported as understudying Mr. M. A. Gover, a Process Superintendent, is  actually understudying  Mr. K. R. Desai, a Process Superintendent. Mr. Achola will fully takeover on 31st January. 1986 when Mr. Desai leaves the company. They also include Mr. Charles Mwangi, Mr. Hannington  Nandi,  Mr.  Bernard wakisakenyi. The  three  gentlemen  were in  active training with a view to having one of them appointed as the company’s Financial Controller in Place of Mr. J. Lela. Of the three gentlemen, Mr. H. Nandi was deemed the most promising one and that is why his name was given as understudying  an  expatriate.  The company however realized that the three would not make the grade and has  already  recruited  from the open labour market, Mr. J. Z. Abuta as the Chief Accountant and is now understudying the Financial Controller.Mr. Albert Memo was reported as understudying the Technical Manager was in fact understudying Mr. D.S. Vora a Process Superintendent.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH> Mr. Michoma: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Although the Minister is Making a very important Ministerial Statement, there is too much noise.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH> Mr. Speaker: Order! There is too much noise and we want to hear what hon. ale Tipis is saying.</NEWSPEECH> <NEWSPEECH> The Minister of State, Office of the President (Mr. ole Tipis): Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.Mr. Albert Gumo has now fully taken over as a Process  Superintendent  and the  expatriate has left the country.Mr. Frank Ruto, who was reported as understudying the Technical Manager, alcohol, in my earlier report was actually not understudying any expatriate. Mr. Ruto was just  appointed on  six months probation  in  January, 1984.  However, despite  extension  of  the probation period, he has not made the grade so far.Mr.  Humphrey  Kigalio,  as  stated before is understudying an expatriate Mr. D. V. Saraiya. a Process Superintendent. When he writes that and signs that he is not understudying the expatriate, he is not telling the truth at all. There were also Mr. Michael Welula and Miss Judith Odhianho. In my last report, I informed the House that Mr. Welula was actually understudying the Chief Chemist. I have confirmed that Mr. Welula and Miss J. Odhiambo are both understudying the Senior Chemist.Mr. Alfred Nyikal in my earlier reply was reported to be understudying the Chief Mechanical Engineer. However, he is actively understudying, the Senior Mechical Engineer.  Mr. A.   M.  Noorani.  Mr.  Arnold Mnjama, as I had indicated in my earlier reply, is understudying Mr. Noorani. the Senior Mechanical Engineer. This is not  true  as  he  is  not  understudying   any expatriate.As can be seen Mr. Speaker, Sir, most of the Kenyans I previously mentioned are actually understudying the expatriates. Since 25th November, 1985, the management has submitted a new list of Kenyans understudying, the expatriates. The company has also put forward their proposal for phasing out the 16 expatriates as fellows: four in 1986: five in 1988 and seven in 1990. The detailed list of those understudying the expatriates is indicated in  the list that I am going to lay on the Table. These people are 12 of them. As stated before, the company has  adopted an acceptable Kenyanization programme. As I had said, we are taking appropriate action with regard to the few misleading facts which they submitted to us. Thank you. </NEWSPEECH> PERSONAL STATEMENT production and collection of milk from the small-scale dairy farmers.

These people tin May, June, and August, did not get their salaries. They got the salaries for four months in August. But they have not got their salaries for September. October and November.

You had better lay those documents on the Table. You are taking too long; that is what I am trying to indicate.</NEWSPEECH> <NEWSPEECH> Mr. Mathenge: I am just sorting  them  out,  Mr. Speaker,-Sir.So,   the headmaster  decided   to   issue  postdated 	cheques for next year to the contributors after consuming the money.  One cheque  is  for  Sh. 18.023,  and 	this is to be drawn on 14th January, 1986;  the other one is Ito be drawn on 20th January, 1986, and it will 	be paid in favour of Masomo Savings and Credit Co-operative   Society  at  Nyahurutu  Commercial  Bank,amounting to Sh.  18,096.

Sir.  last 	week hon.  Sifuna. the Member for Bung-ma South, 	on a point of order, raised the issue concerning Sh. 105 	Million  Which   the  Kenya   Co-operative  Creameries 	(K.C.C.) owes the Dairy Development Committee from 	the proceeds of the World Food  Programme powder milk and buster oil. For the benefit of the hon. Members, the position is as follows:In  1982,  the  World  Food Programme  sinned an agrement with the Kenya Government whereby the World Food Programme would slimily Kenya well15.960:tons or dried skimmed milk and  2 480 tons of butter Oil. The two commodites were to be recombined, with the fresh milk by the K.C.C. and sold as fresh milk of standard quality.  The funds realized from the sales of this milk were to be used to support programme and processed the milk, and by the end of June 1985, proceeds from the sale of re-combined milk amounted to Sh. 105,169,712. Further sales for the months of July, August, September and October brought the figure to Sh. 131,100,b97. I would like to assure this House that these funds are in safe custody. The money was banked with the Barclays Bank and the Housing Finance Company of Kenya, bearing interest at the rate of 111 to 131 per cent per annum respectively. The maturity will be January to March 1987.The K.C.C. has already released Sh.  14.2 million to the Kenya Dairy Board,  which  is charged with the responsibility of executing the Daily Development Committee projects. Arrangements are at  hand  to 	release the rest  of the money to the Kenya Dairy 	Board for the purpose for which it was intended. I may also like to add here that K.C.C. has operated profitably this  year;  they  have  a  surplus  of  Sh. 66,298,680,  and  they  have  paid  the  farmers  Sh. 60,790,400 out of the surplus based on the deliveries to the  company  during the year ended 30th June,1985.  The K.C.C. is also due to pay dividends to the shareholders who purchased them in 1962. 1967 and 1976 some Sh. 5,175,500 because all these are overdue.Thank you, Mr. Speaker. </NEWSPEECH> 	<HEADER> POINTS OF ORDER </HEADER><Header> FATE OF GARBATULA SECONDARY SCHOOL CANDIDATES 	TO SIT A RELIGIOUS PAPER </Header><NEWSPEECH> Mr.  Kiome:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker  On 18th November, 1985, the students at isiolo Garbatula Secondary School did not sit Paper H examination in Christian Religious Education.

The debate or whatever  I am  allered to  have said or done was done and I did this in this house So that is why I am following up this matter; whether they have  the right to “punish”	or to demonstrate for what I said in this House.<NEWSPEECH> Mr.  Speaker:  Well,  I  think 	I have explained  the position as I see it after reading what is reported in the papers.</NEWSPEECH></NEWSPEECH> The Attorney-General  (Mr. Muli): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I  cannot add to that from the Speakers mouth because it is the correct position. This House has what we call  "absolute privilege" against any attacks or suits   [The Attorney-General]being brought in court in respect of statements made by any hon. Member in this House.<i> (Applause) </i>This also applies to what we call "qualified privilege" in respect of statements made by a witness in a court of law. Now, as fair as I can see from the papers and the Speaker has very clearly explained it, there is no intention  or any move to bring what you said in this House or hon. Members said in this House to court.Maybe it is contention by some hon. Members of disagreeing with what hon. Members said here, and he is at liberty  anywhere to  say  "I  disagree why you hon. Member".So, Sir, I cannot add to what fell from the Speakers mouth.</NEWSPEECH> <NEWSPEECH> Mr. Munyao: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am seeking guidance from the Chair because, now that this has bapwined to hon. Shikuku, tomorrow it will be somebody else and so on. We would like to put the record straight and give this House the respect it de serves. What is the Ohaird guidance on this matter? What steps can be taken at least to stop lit because it is going to movelike wild fire and it is also going to sit a very bad president? Nobody is going to be safe because it is going to be applied everywhere. It is something which is just starting but it is going to barn like wild fire throught Kenya. What can be done to  maintain the dignity of this House This issue is not personal to hon. shikuku; it concerns the whole House. So, what are we going to do to stop this kind of thing?</NEWSPEECH> <NEWSPEECH> Mr. Speaker: I have already stated the position as I see it, and the Attorney-General has also commented on it. He has even given assurance that the law still protects hon. Members and I do not think we are gaining much by just repeating it.</NEWSPEECH> <NEWSPEECH> Mr. Kikuyu: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.While agreeing totally with your ruling and with what the Attorney-General has said that the law of this nation privileges and safeguards all hon. Members on what they say in this House, is the Attorney-General going to institute any legal proceedings against those people Who abused the privileges of hon. Shikuku in this House?<NEWSPEECH> (Applause)<NEWSPEECH> The Attorney-General (Mr. Muli): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not aware of any person or persons who have infringed the provision of the law that protects Members of this House. All that I said is that the absolute privilege exits.  If an hon.  Member says or utters something that is not acceptable outside in his constituency, or in the country, any Member is bound and is at liberty to comment on it, confirm it or disagree with the hon. Member. That does not fall within the privilege provision. On the other hand, if an hon. Member says something about the Attornev-General and then the Attorney-General sues that hon. Member in court, the court will stop it and say, "Sorry, the hon. Memberhas absolute privilege to say what he said in the House."</NEWSPEECH>  PROCEDURAL MOTION<HEADER> EXEMPTION OF S.O.

Sir. I am rising on a point of order to seek for you: guidance here. The Second Reading of the Pension: Laws (Amendment) Bill appears on the Order Paper and the Bill appears again in the Committee of thi Whole House. I agree with the Order Paper as far a the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Amendment) Bill i concerned.  Our Standing Order No. 99 does not see that a Bill cannot go through two stages in one sitting So, is the Pensions Laws (Amendment) Bill going to go through  the Committee of the Whole House?</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH> Mr. Speaker: Yes, we will do it with the leave the House.Mr. Kiome was speaking.</NEWSPEECH> <NEWSPEECH> Mr. Kiome: Sir, as	was saying yesterday, if th Bill  passes  in  its  present form,  it is very likely t frustrate a  few persons who reached ten years after 14th August this year, or those who find themselves reaching ten  years  early in 1990  at the time when   Mr. Kiome: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to say I wish Parliament is not able to sit for the reasons I stated yesterday. Parliament may have short Adjournment or dissolve for quite sometime, and during that period, a civil servant may suffer or lose a few months of his service.  As a matter of fact, those person’s who are going to attain the age of ten years after 13th August this year are going to lose a whole number of  ten years because they have to stay there until they reach45 years of age.</NEWSPEECH> <NEWSPEECH> The Attorney-General  (Mr.  Muli):  On a point of order. Sir, since yesterday, this hon. Member, who is a lawyer, seems not to have understood the purpose ofthe  two  amendments.  The  first  one,  as  explained,deals  with the civil servants under a special scheme whereby a civil servant, having served for ten years and has attained 45 years, can retire. That is a separate question.The next one concerns Parliamentarians, ourselves. The law provides that you must serve for ten years before you start earning pension. Now, there comes a time when, due to certain occurrence of events, Parliament may be dissolved and Members go out and are not returned. They are being made to qualify so that they benefit notwithstanding of the ten years. So, these are two different things, Mr.  Deputy Speaker.</NEWSPEECH> <NEWSPEECH> Mr. Shikoku: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Sir, are you satisfied  that the hon. Attorney-General was on a point of order? I do not recall hearing him say that he was standing on a point of information. I am saying so because he has been advancing an argument and yet he stood  on a point of order. Was that in order?</NEWSPEECH> <NEWSPEECH> The Attorney-General (Mr. Muli): Sir, I was giving a point of information,</NEWSPEECH> <NEWSPEECH> Mr. Shikoku: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Sir, the  Attorney-General  has  even  made matters worse. He should stand up and say, "On a point of information", and he can only give that information, according to  our Standing  Orders,  if the hon.  speaker on the Floor allows him. So, he should not take us for a ride.</NEWSPEECH> <NEWSPEECH> Mr. Kiome:  Sir, can the learned Attorney-General withdraw that point of order?Mr.  Speaker:  Well, he  has  already explained that it was a point of information.</NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH> Mr. Kiome: Sir, I was referring to clause 2 which is amending section 6 (1) (a) (i) and (ii), and I had not reached the  Parliamentary  pension problems.  If the learned Attorney-General looks at that clause, he will see that the second amendment takes away the benefits of ten years unless one reaches 45 years. That benefit existed before. That is what I was saying. I think I will leave it there because my learned friend is a lawyer and he will  do  the  interpretation  correctly.  As I stated before, I had reached the second stage of the parliamentary part in the Bill.Mr. Kimosop! On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Sir, since the hon. Member speaking is repeating himself, I would like to move that the Mover be called upon to reply.</NEWSPEECH> <i> (A p pl ause) </i> <NEWSPEECH> Mr. Speaker: Order!  Order! You cannot do it that way and I think it is only fair; we have very little time. Therefore, I will put the question for the House to decide.</NEWSPEECH> (Question, that the Mover be now called upon to reply 	put and agreed to)<NEWSPEECH> Mr. Kiome: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I am seeking your guidance on the meaning of Standing Order No. 99 Which says "with leave of the House" Was the leave of the House sought?</NEWSPEECH> <NEWSPEECH> Mr.  Speaker:  Yes, it  was  sought. There was no opposition. So, it was 100 per cent in order.</NEWSPEECH> <NEWSPEECH> The Minister for Finance (Prof. Saitati): Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I will not take the time of this House unnecessarily. This is because as I stated when moving this Bill, it is a clearly straight forward Bill. The objectives of the Bill are three; (1) to allow the  officers  who  are  in  Job Group  "L"  and above including teachers to be able to retire on the attainment of the age of 45 years on the proviso that they have served for 10 years. That is basically what is recommended.The other  objective was  to simplify  or,  make it easier for policemen and wardens and those who are working in the Forestry Department who have already served for 12 years, 16 years and 20 years to retire. This is to ensure that they do not need to give three months  notice  if they  want to retire;  one months notice is considered to be sufficient.The other objective is the one that touches on the hon.  Members of this House; to make it easier for them to actually enjoy the pension privileges as long as they have served for two terms in this House again on the proviso that the aggregate number of years is five years. These objectives are straightforward and clear. It is a simple Bill and I do urge the hon. Members of this House to support it.With these few remarks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.(Question put and agreed to)(The Bill was read a Second Time and committed to a Committee of the whole House today by leave of then </NEWSPEECH>House)COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE HOUSE(Order for Committee read) [Mr. Speaker left the Chair]<i>IN THE COMIMITEE [Mr. Chairman took the Chair] </i>THE STATUTE LAW ((!MISCELLANEOUS MENDMENTS) 	BILL<i> (Clause  2 agreed to) </i>ScheduleThe Attorney-General (Mr Milli): Mr. Chairman.

I wish  to  seek assurance from the Minister that this Bill will not bar them from benefiting if they have served for 10 years. This is because this one talks about  the age of 45 years. I would like the Minister to assure us that those who are to retire next year or perhaps in November this year, under that ten-year -rule, will  benefit.  Can he assure  us  that they  will not  lose  their  benefits because we have enacted this law?</NEWSPEECH> <NEWSPEECH> Mr. Chairman: Hon. Minister, you are required to give an assurance.</NEWSPEECH>  <NEWSPEECH> The Minister for Finance (Prof. Saitoti):  Basically, 	think, Mr. Chairman, Sir, the assurance is there. The passage of this Bill is not in any way intended to put people at a disadvantaged position.</NEWSPEECH> <NEWSPEECH> Mr. Shikuku:  On a point of order, Mr. Chairman, Sir. I did not quite get clearly what the Minister for Finance said. At any rate, my knowledge is that the assurance by the Minister is not law. So, if the hon. Member sought to amend that section he should have done so. This is because the assurance given by the Minister for Finance today holds no water in law.</NEWSPEECH> <NEWSPEECH> M. Karatari: Mr. Chairman, perhaps I should have proposed an amendment but given the fact that there is no time to do so, I should like to draw the attention: 	of -the Minister to the fact that there are people who are going to lose as a result of us passing this Bill. These are the people who are about to complete their ten years service in Government. It is this same Government which introduced this ten years retirement rule but those who are going to retire under this rule next year are now not going to get their benefits. Will the Minister assure this House that he is going to bring an amendment later to this Bill so that those people who have served the Government under the ten year rule are not going to lose?  This rule involves those who are in Job Group L and above and they have served the Government believing that when they retire, they will get all their benefits. We are requesting the Minister to introduce an amendment later on so that a number of people who now feel frustrated by this Dili, can benefit I am saying this because the Government  which introduced this  ten-year retirement  rule is the same Government which has brought this Bill to  the  House  today.  So, since there is no  time to propose an amendment, I would request the Minister to consider this point.Again, Sir, In clause 2, it is stated that the Bill, if it becomes an lot, is supposed to operate up to 1990.Can the Minister consider to amend this so that it is not limited to 1990 so that it becomes  continuous? This will enable anybody on Job Group L and above who have served for ten years to benefit.</NEWSPEECH> </NEWSPEECH> Prof. Saitoti:  Mr. Chairman, I do not really think t h at there is anything more which I can add here, other than to repeat what I said, mainly that the purpose of this Bill is not going -to put people in a less privileged position than they were  before.  Rules, in any case, are continuously reviewed  by this honorable House so as to be able to close loop holes wherever we find there are such  loopholes.  This particular Bill, when it becomes an Act, is not going to be entirely permanent and therefore, if we find that there are some loopholes. measures will be taken to -tighten up the Act.</NEWSPEECH>s <i> (Clause 2 agreed to) </i> <i> (Clause 3 and 4 agreed to) </i><i> (Title agreed to) (Clause 1 agreed to) </i> 	<NEWSPEECH The  Attorney-General	(Mr.  Muli):  Mr.  Chairmen,	Mr. Karauri: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not Sir, I  beg to move that the Committee. cloth report to the House its consideration of the Statute Law (Miscel. laneous  Amendments)  Bill and  the  Pensions  Laws (Amendment) Bill with amendments.</NEWSPEECH> <i> (Question proposed)(Question put and agreed to) 	(The House resumed) </i>[Mr. Deputy Speaker in the Chair]REPORTS AND THIRD READINGS<HEADER> THE STATUTE LAW (MISCELLANEOUS AMENDMENTS) </HEADER> 	BILLTHE PENSIONS LAWS (AMENDMENT) BILL<NEWSPEECH> The Vice-President and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr. Kibaki):  MT.

Under this ten-year retirement rule, these people 	were not required to reach the age of 45 before their 	retirement is considered. Now, this Dili is talking about 	starting this  ten-year  rule after 14th  August, 1985. 	I am only requesting the Minister to come soon to this House to ennead this Act again so that those people serving under the ten years retirement mule do not lose. They anticipated to retire at the age of 45 after Government had allowed them to serve under the ten-years rule. So naturally, they thought that after serving for ten 	years in Government they will retire without necessarily reaching the age of 45 yesr by beneficting by the rule. However by passing this bill they are not going to benefit because some of them are not yet 45 years although  they  have  been  serving  under  the ten-year rule.An hon. Member! Yes, he will bring an amendment to this effect.<i> (Question put and agreed to)(The Bill was accordingly read the Third Time 	and passed) </i> MOTION FOR ADJOURNMENT<HEADER> ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE "SINE DIE" </HEADER> 	<NEWSPEECH> The Vice-President and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr. leitbaki):  Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move that this House do now adjourn </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH> Mr.  Shikuku:  On a  point of order, Mr.  Deputy Speaker.   would be like to &Art His Excellency the Vice President, but on todays Order Paper, it is said 	that we should start our business by 10.30 a.m. Due to the fact that it is now 10 ;minutes past that time, could we apse extend the mime of two hours taking into account the 10 minutes already gone?</NEWSPEECH> <i> (Question, that the House do adjourn at 12.40 p.m., 	put and agreed to) </i><NEWSPEECH> The Vice-President and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr. Kibaki):  Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move !that this House do new adjourn sine die. As you, yourself, have said, we are all lied a very long Session, endI am sure we are all feeling the same way that it is new time we adjourned. In any case, this is the Charismas season and we want to take good news to our families.I know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that it is the wish of the House that we confirm what you said in the Communications from the Chair that we wish His Excel-limey the President a merry Christmas and a. prosperous Now Year.(Applause)I am quite sure that what would give His Excellency the President the greatest joy is if we, as hon. Members, and all leaders in the whole nation were, in fact, in our own actions to do more of those things he has kept   [The Vice-President and Minister for Home Affairs] telling us he wants to see done. We should, for instance, love one another, leave in peace and seek greater unity. To achieve those goals, it means that one great thing must happen; a Change of attitude in on minds. We have got to be more tolerant of differing views in the society because, as you and all of us know, tolerance is the true basis of democracy. Without tolerance of differing views, indeed, and if anybody believes .that only he is right merely because he has become a chair-man of Kanu or whatever else he has become, the society cannot have the peace we want. Let us have tolerance, greater tolerance  than  we have now. Let us treat one another as brothers. There are going to be differences between brothers, but they  do not fight. They accept that God gave each person some intelligence. if we have intelligence, we should sometimes view the same situation differently.Mr. Deputy Speaker, what we really seek in this Christmas season is that we resolve to promote greater tolerance of differing views because that is the true free society where such tolerance exists. A society which comes to believe only in one line has ceased to be tree. A society that is truly free remains open, end that is the greatness of our nation. Our own President promotes an open society, the society Kenya, respecting views from everywhere. He, himself, allows so much freedom in this nation. So if we do more of what hedoes, we shall have, indeed, pleased him greatest.Above all, in this programme of conservation of all types, we should make it OUT resolve to do as the President does.  At every function he is officiating, the 	President always plants a tree. Why do we not do the same  ourselves? Whatever  we  are  promoting,  plant a tree and get everybody used to doing the same thing. By so doing, we are actually going to promote among cur people thinking directly of conservation.The other thing I would like to mention. Mr. Deputy Speaker, is that, since we have talked enough during this Session, we should make it one of our 1986 new year resolutions that we shall talk less and concentrate more on action.   keep saying this thing for one obvious reason. The more I travel around the more I notice that Kenyans have grown so mature in their politics that they are no longer judging us by what we proclaim. It does not matter how we proclaim that we are very pro-Nyayo; they judge us by what we are doing. That is what convinces them. They no longer take words in good faith; they want to see action. This is the truth which we all know to be the truth. So let us make our newyear resolution to talk less and do more. Above all, let us resolve to cease and stop completely warningother people. We are warning others too much.(Applause)Mr.  Deputy Speaker,  if you take any newspaper today, you will see that everybody is warning every-body else. The assistant chief is warning such and such a man, the Member of Parliament is warning somebody else,  the  Minister  is  warning  somebody, the district commissioner is also warning somebody, and so on. What we are doing is that we are creating an impression that there is some sense of crisis in the whole nation. Why do we not concentrate on saying the things we want to do? We must do this so that we direct people towards action, and not just warning them as if there were a crisis. There is no crisis at all. The greatest thing we have  on this  continent  is the  freedom that  the President has established. There has been a sense of unity and peace,  which, as the song goes, since the President took over the leadership of this nation hascontinued to expand and increase. Why do we keepwarning and doing all these other things? It is time leaders spoke about what should be done and what they want done so that what is reported over the radio and in the  other media is all about action,  with people saying, "I want this done. We have got to do this." Then, we will create in everybody’s mind a work ethic and cause them to think in terms of work and action. This is the way we are going to be developing the nation, rather than by all these warnings and other peculiar things.Finally, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like, on my own behalf, to wish every Member here a merry Christmas and a happy new year. Above all, I want to thank all hon. Members for the manner in which they worked during this very long Session. We have co-operated extremely well, and I am sure we will carry this over into 1986.With that, I beg to move.</NEWSPEECH> (Applause)<NEWSPEECH> The Minister for Energy and Regional Development(Mr. Biwott): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me this opportunity to contribute to this Motion. I stand to second the Motion for the Adjournment of the House sine die. I think we will all agree that the level at which we have been deliberating our debates has been very high and this shows that hon. Members are doing their  homework.  This  is  very  good,  and  we should thank all hon. Members for being dedicated to the welfare  of  those  whom  they  represent.  If we continue to serve our people the way we have been doing and at the already-established standard, I am quite sure that this august House will not be serving only the people who have brought us here, but it will also be acting as an example to the world.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, independent Kenya is now over 21 years old, and is a mature country. The leadership issue is solved; people know exactly whom they want and they choose their own leaders, knowing how to proceed from one type of leadership to another. So we are actually a stable society in that we know our part to play. We know where we are going and all that we want. Therefore, there is no room for people to waste time. We are all members of the same family, and we should look at the plight of the poorest man in this country and see how we can raise that fellows standard to that he can also live and enjoy the little time that we have in this world. In the past, our society has been plagues by intrigues, people being guided by jealousy and burning greed. In the past, some people have  not  really minded about the welfare of others   [The Minister for Energy and Regional Development]but rather have minded about their own welfare. We are very pleased that at the moment our people are mature enough. Therefore, we are in a position where we can only concentrate on the welfare of our people and also the security of our people. In that process, and in this period of Nyayoism, we know that Nyayo is just, fair and considerate and has a lot of patience. Nyayo is also mindful of other people’s welfare. So, in fact, What we should be aiming at now is to raiseour standards of fairness and justice as much as possible so that our people can see justice in whatever we do. Justice will always prevail, no matter whether it is done today or not. It will always be seen even in years after, if we are able to do justice.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I just wanted to emphasizethe fact that our people are very clear in their minds, and that the children are already ahead of us; they and their mothers and other people in the country-side know Nyayo. In fact, in the country-side tribalism does not  exist;  it  only  exists  among ;those  people  who pronounce it. All the people throughout the country do not want anything to do with tribalism. What we ought to be doing at the moment is to involve ourselves in development projects because that is where our people would like to see us perform bolter. We should be appearing in the district development committees and we should also engage ourselves in all the Harambee projects and other projects concerned with conservation. We should, in fact, try to use whatever opportunity we have to improve our knowledge of things that move around us.Sir, I have just noticed that little is known about what we do in my Ministry, and it is my hope that during the Recess hon. Members will visit our projects. I will be happy to receive requests from hon. Membersto see some of our own projects because I feel that if hon. Members are aware of what we are doing, we will be able to get better understanding and development. We will do  everything  and  my  officers  have  been instructed to be useful so that hon. Members can see much of what we are doing, and that is a good idea.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, our people only now require practical men, and I was glad to hear the hon. Vice-President and Minister for Home Affairs talk about warnings.  I think that warning is  actually prevalent among the members of the Press. Those who communicate.  If they do not write about warning,  then there will be no warning. If the Voice of Kenya does not broadcast that warning, there would be no warning. Nobody is warning anybody else, and I think we should improve our standard of journalism so that in that standard there will be no warning. In any case, who do we warn in this country? We know each other very well. Even those who operate in the remotest manner, we know that they are there and they are operating.With those few remarks, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to second.</NEWSPEECH> <i> (Question proposed) </i><NEWSPEECH> Mrs.  Asiyo:  Thank  you  very  much, Mr.  Deputy Speaker, Sir, for this opportunity. would like to call upon the Ministers for Energy and Regional Development, Transport and Communications and Water Development to visit the country-side during the  Recess.  It is good  that  the Minister for Energy and Regional Development has asked us to visit him also and find out what is happening in this Ministry I would also like to invite him to visit the country-side this time. We want him to know that women in the country-side have no firewood. We also want the Minister for Water Development to knew that women are waling even longer distances in search of water. We appreciate  what  the  Minister  for  Energy  and  Regional Development has done so far, and we know that he is going to do much more because he is a young energetic man who knows the problems of the people and will definitely address himself to the problems that women, who are the majority of the cooks in this country, with exception of a few men who cook in hotels using electricity or gas. So, Sir, I am requesting these three Ministers, through you, to visit the country-side and see the problems of water and other problems of communication that people of this country have in getting from point A to point B because of the state of reads in some of the constituencies in this country.Sir, I also do hope that the Minister for Education, Science and Technology will also visit primary and secondary  schools  during  the Recess. There is one very disturbing problem that one other hon. Member mentioned this morning, this one of headmasters collecting examination fees and not registering the students. It has happened to three schools in my area. Students, especially those who were going to sit for Kenya Junior Secondary Examination.  There is a  particular high school called Gendia Who pocketed all the money including money the students gave for school fees. Let the Minister go out there or send his people because the district education officer is already aware. We want the Minister to address himself to the problems of the poor people who work very hard to contribute to the education of their children, and who are frustrated by those who get salaries like headmasters. They must not pocket or use the money that these poor peasant farmers pay for the education of their children without the Ministry taking action to reprimand them and do justice to the Students and their parents.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Lake. Basin Development Authority is really supposed to respect the priorities of the district development committees. We have a case  in point where, in  South Nyanza  District,  the managing director has refused to accept the priorities of the district development committee as concerns water in my constituency.  I hope he is not waiting for a messiah before he can start respecting the views of the district development committee so that people can got water as has been recognized and very well said by the District Development Committee, South Nyanza.Lastly, Sir, I would like to say that what happened in Butere was a precedent that must not be encouraged or allowed to continue in  this country.  What is the use of rocking this boat? We are all members of onefamily and we are in the same boat. Why bore a hole   in this boat when you know that we will all perish? Surely, can we not sit on a table and really discuss whatever we have to  discuss as brothers  and sisters instead of exposing what does not even exist?  Kenya is a peaceful country and we are all enjoying a wonderful atmosphere of peace. His Excellency the President is working so very hard preaching every day that we should be mindful of other peoples welfare, we should be peaceful and that we,  as leaders, should preach and practice peace. But, a handful of people do not seem to adhere to his advice. I am hoping that during this Recess there will be a new spirit of understanding and tolerance of brotherhood so that Kenya can stand out as a country among  the nations of Africa that really cherish and practice freedom as well as democracy as we have done, instead of  bogging ourselves down with very  petty squabbles and differences that really do  not exist and that really do not matter in this country.Recently, Sir, the newly-elected Kanu Chairman in my constituency issued a statement in the Press that I should apologize because I did not attend a meeting. In the first place, there was no Kanu meeting held. He simply got, up and made a statement to the newspapers and I have been waiting for his letter and it has not come to me up to now. Such irresponsible statements should be discouraged, especially among elected leaders who are respected by the people to serve them and the nation.With those few remarks, Sir, I beg to support.</NEWSPEECH> <NEWSPEECH> The Assistant Minister for Education, Science and Technology (Mr. Mweu):  Ahsante  sana,  Bw.  Naibu Spika, kwa kunipatia  nafasi hii kwanza nimshuikuru Mtukufu Rais kwa kazi nzuri sana ambayo amefanya kwa wananchi wa Kenya kwa mwaka mzima wote huu bila kuchoka na hata bila kwenda I.ikizoni. Tunamshukuru Lana.Pill, Bw. Naibu Spika, ningependa kuichukua nafasi hii 	kumshukuru Mwenyezi Mungu kwa sababu ametupatia mvua mwaka huu vote. Hatukuwa na upungufu wa mvua sana, hivi kwamba tuna ma:tumaini nakubwa,sana, sana kwa 	ya mvua inayoendelea kunyesha, kwamba tutaweza kupata chakula cha kutosha. Tunaumaini kwamba sehemu nyingine hazitategemea misaada ya chakula kutoka kwa Sertkali kama hail ihvyo kuwa ,hapo mbeleni. Kurikuwa na upungufu wakatia sehemu za Kitui Kusii kwa sababu ya viwavi waliotokea mwaka jana na tena kwa sababu ya ukosefu wa mvua miezi wa Machi na Aprili. Lakini inaonekana kwamba kila mahali mvua imenyesha kwa njia ya kufurahisha, na tunayo nratumaini mengi kwamba tutaweza kuvuna ipasavyo.Jambo la tatu ni kuifahamisha Wizara ya Kilimo na Ustawi wa Mifugo kuwa wakati kama huu tunaweza kupata mavuno mengi sana laktni kunakuwa na wadudu wengi wanaoiharibu mimea. Tunatumaini Wizara hiyo item  dawa hata  kupitia maofisi ya  macifu ili some tuweze kupata dawa za wadudu na kuwaangamiza ilikutoa  mavuno  zaidi, kama  vile mbaazi, maharawe, kunde na kadhalika. Jambo lingine, Bw. Naibu Spika, ni kuishukuru SeXikati kwa  juntla,  hasa  kuhusu mipango ambayo  imekuwa ikiendelea.   Katika   mawakilisho   yangu, 	inafuraha kuona mipango mingi imeweza kukamlika, hata iliyopangwa tangu mwaka wa 1976, na imekuwa ikiendelea tangu waked u  mpaka sasa kutokaia na kutopangwa vizuri, au pengine kwa kuotolewa kwa pesa  wakati unaofaa.  Ninashukuru  sasa kwa  sababu kupitia kwa m ango wa district focus posa zimetolewa na mipango ya  maji, shule na kadhalika  imetimizwa na  ninawashukuru sana maofisa walioko wilayani wanaohusika na kazi hiyo. Utekelezaji hu  umetuweze.tha kuendelea na mipango mingine inayoa.nzishwa na kamati za maendeleo wilayani.Pia mipango mingine ambayo bado,haijakamilika kwa sababu kuna mingine inayogharimu milioni hata nne. Ninashukuru kwa sababu mipango kama hiyo inaendelea na inaonekana wazi iliendelea bila taabu yo yote. Hii  ni kwa sababu pesa  zikipatikana zinatolewa kwa wakati unaofaa. Hii 	kwa sababu uwekaji wa hazina umekabiliwa wakuu wa wilaya, badala ya kuwa tukija hapa Nairobi, ama Embu kupata fedha. Tunashukuru sana kwa sababu ya m ango huu.Ningependa kuchukua nafasi hii kuwashukuru maofisa wote katika Wilaya ya kitui, ambao wamekuwa wakiianya kazi nzuri. Ninatumaini Mungu atawabariki waweze kuendelea na kazi nzuri wanayofanya.</NEWSPEECH> (Hon. Members stood in their places)<NEWSPEECH> Mr. Deputy Speaker: Order!</NEWSPEECH> <NEWSPEECH> The  Assistant Minister for Education, Science and Technology (Mr.  Mweu):  Nimeshangaa  kwa sababu muda wangu bado.Jambo Engine ni kutoa h.akikisho kwa Mhe. Asiyo aliyesema   juu  ya shule ya  Gendia   ambapo   alidai kwamba mambo ya pesa yaliwafanya wanafunzi huko kutofanya mtihani wao. Kwa niaba ya Wizara ningependa kusema kuwa tunaweza kuliingilia jambo kama hilo ukielezwa. Si rahisi kuwa tukijua mambo kamahaya, kama Wizara, yakitokea. Kuna jambo lilitotokea huko  upande  wa  Garbatula.  Si mapenzi ya  Wizara kuona wanafunzi wakiaabika. Kwa sababu hiyo nngependa  kuwa.omba  Wabunge  hapa  kutupasha habari mambo kama hayo yakitokea ili tuweze kuyaingilia na kuyasuluhisha.Ahsante sana.</NEWSPEECH> <NEWSPEECH>Mr, Lalampaa: Ahsante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika, kwakunipa  nafasi.   Ningependa  kuungana  na  Wabunge wenzangu  ambao  tayari  wamezungumza kutoa shuk-rani  nyingi  kwa  Mtukufu Rais kwa uongozi wake wa busara hapa nchini. Kenya inaendelea mbele kwa sababu ya uongozi mzuri  wa Mtukufu Rais. Tunafahamu vyema kwamba katika Bara la Afrika inasemekana kila wakati kwenye redio na kupitia kwa magazeti kuwa mambo ayaendelei. Sisi tuna bahati na tungetaka kumshukuru Mwenyezi Mungu kwa sababu sasa tunaelewa   Kenya   inaelekea wapi   tangu   Mtukufu Rais kuchukua atamu ya uongozi. Hii ndyo sababu tunaweza .kuvuta hewa safi hapa nchini na hata kupata watalii wengi sana wanaoleta pesa za kigeni.  Jambo ambalo  ningependa  kusema ni kuwa kama tungekubali kwa raja kuufuata uongozi wa Mtukufu Rais, hatuweZi kuwa na kelele yo  yote nchini. Kwa hivyo, ni juu ya viongozi kufanya hivyo kwa sababu tumeambiwa na tunajua kuwa wananchi watukulu wa nchi 	hawana ubaya wo wote na aranrnfuata Mtukufu Rais, na  anaelewa wanaelekea wapi. Sisi viongozi mho huchokora  huku  na  kule  wakati fulani.  Hii   ndiyo sababu u.nasikia kuna vita au makelele mahali pengi.Tungetaka natindo	ukome kabtsa.Jambo ngine ni kumtolea shukrani Mtukufu Rais kwa kuukubali ule mpango wa mipango ya maendeleo kuwa wilayani. 	kwa sababu matunda ya mipango hiyo yanaoneka.na sasa wananchi wanapata maendeleoharaka  sana, kuli 	 ilivyokuwa hapo mbeleni. Jmbo ambalo  ningependa  kuomba ni  kwamba Wizara  ya talii na Wanyarna wa Porini iyachunguze sana mambo kuhusu wanyama wa porini. Hii ni kwa sababu wananchi wengi sana wameyapoteza maisha yao kutokana na  wanya.ma. wa porini.  Wakulima pia wamepoteza mifugo yao, kama ngmbe, mbuzi, kondco na kadhalika.  Inachukua muda mrefu sana kwa Wizara kulipa ridhaa. Kwa vile wilaya zimefanywa kuwa chanzo cha maendeleo, ungependa,  kuomba Wizara uhakikisha kuwa malipo ya ridhaa yanaliprwa katika wilaya ili malipo iweze kufanyika haraka iwezekanavyo, katika wilaya mbaiimbali, maisha ya binadamu na mifugo  yanapo haribiwa, na pia mimea inapoharibiwa na wanyama hao. Mpaka  sasa kuna watu wengi sana wamekaa  muda mrefu sana bila kupata ridhaa hiyo.Italcuwa ni  jambo  la maana sana kufanya malipo hayo   kutolewa  katika  wilaya  kwa  sababu   kwenye kamati   za maendeleo wilayani mwenyekiti huwa  ni mkuu wa wilaya	na Wabunge huwa  ni wanachama,na pia wasimamizi wa idara mbalimbli 	wa.nachama. ficiwa kamati ya kutoa ridhaa wilayani itatoa uamuzi wa malipo hayo, hatuoni haja ya kutuma ku bukumbu za mikutano ya kamati biyo mpaka hapa Nairobi, na baada ya hapo inawabidi fwanaotaka ridhaa kungojea tniaka  mitatu  ama mine  kabla ya  kulipwa.  Kuna kesi Mani kama hizo kutoka Samburu na .ninahakika kesi kama hizo ziko katika sehemu nyingine nchini.Kwa hivyo, Bw.  Naibu spika	wakati umewadia kwa Wizara hii kutoa pesa za ridhaa katika kila wilaya nchini ili wananchi waweze kupata haki yao Wananchi hawaombi zawadi, bati ni haki yao Kama umempoteza jamaa yako, ama milEugo na mimea yako imeharibia ni lazima Wizara hii kulipa ridhaa. Hii ni kwa sababu tunaishi kati ya wanyama wa porini.Sote   tunakuhali  kuwa wanyama hawa wa  porini wanatuletea pesa za kigeni, lakini vile vile tungefaa kuangalia hasara iayotokana na wanyama hao wa porini. We are not against wildlife in the country. Lakini hatuwezi kun:yamaza .wakati wanyama hawa wa porinii wana popinduka na kuwaua binaamu, mifugo na kuharibu mimea ya wakuliima inayowatoa jasho usiku na chana. Wakati umewadia kwa wale wanaopeleka maombi ya kulipwa ridhaa kulipwa mara moja.Ahsante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika. The Assistant Minister for Planning and National Development (Mr. Ngumba): Ahsante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika kwa kunipatia nafasi hit ili niweze kuiunga mkono Hoja hii.Kwanza ningetalka kumshukuru Makamu wa Rais na Waziri wa Mambo ya Nchini kwa kutuombea tuwe na Likizo zuri. Hata mimi kwa niaba ya Bunge hili, ningetaka kumwombea yeye mwenyewe awe na Krismasi nzuri.<i> (Applause) </i>Vile  vile  ninayaunga  mkono  zaidi  yale mamaambayo alieleza hasa ikuhusu Siku uu  ya  Christmas. Tungetaka S11131 sole wakatt wa sikukuu tufikirinne badala ya  "ku.katana miguu" na kusema  maneno  mengine yasiyo na msingi. Ninasema hivyo kwa sababu kuna watu wengine wanasema, "Ngojea waseme u" wakati wanapoendelea kufanya mipango mingine. Tungetaka yale maneno yote ambayo yanasemwa na vongozi katika Bunge  hill na nje yafikiriwe kwa makini sana  .kwa sababu ni ya maana sana. Hayo ndiyo maneno ambayo yaaonyesha ni upande gani nchi yetu inaelekea.Kwanza  ningetaka kumrudishia Rais wetu  ahsante sana kwa. sababu ya ule uchaguzi wa Kanu uliofanyvva juzi.  Uchaguzi  h o ulionyesha Kenya inaenda wapi. Lakini 	kuna  watu  wadache  walishindwa  hapa  na pale na sasa wanaendelea kufanya kampeini kama hawaji kwamba kampeini	zamani. Katika Kenya nzimalhasa Nairobi hakukuwa na matata yo yote baada ya uchaguzi. Tungetaka mtindo huu uendelee Hi tuweze kumaliza  vita  ya  kinyumbani  ya  kuchimbana. Kwawakati   huu	umeona  kwamba  Wabunge  na  watu wengine wana haja na maendeieo. Ni watu wachache to wanakwenda katika mabaa na mahaii pengine kuharibu viongozi fulani fulani. Hii m kwa sababu siasaya watu. Kama hao hayaishi. Lakini katika Bunge hill tumekwishaona kwamba watu vvengi katika Kenya wana haja .na maendeleo akini hawana haja na maneno yasiyo na msingi.Tungetaka sisi viongozi wakati wa Christmas tuwe tukisema maneno ambayo yanaweza .kuwasaidia watu wetu zaidi. Kwanza ni lazima tujaribu kuleta umoja katika nchi hii. Sikukuu itawafanya watu .kufikiria kitu kimoja. Kwa hivyo, 	lazima tujaribu kuleta ushirikian  mwema. Ni heri vongozi wawatikirie wale wasiojiweza.  wengine kati. ya  watu  hao  hawana vyalcula. Wengine wao walizallwa kama viwete. Kwa hivyo, ni vizuri sisi turudi nyu bani kwa wakati huu ili tuweze kuwasaidia ndugu zetu ambao hawajiwezi. Tukifanya hivyo, .bila shka tutawaonyesha watu wetu ni upande gani nchi yetu inaelekea.Vile  vile  .ningetaka  kurudisha  ahsante  sana  kwa Serikali  kwa kutuletea  maendeleo katika  sehemu  ya Mather.  Katika sehemu hiyo viongozi wa Kanu na wanasiasa   wengine   wamtungana   pamoja   kujaribu kuleta maendeleo katika  sehemu hiyo Pia tumekuwa tukifanya kazi na mkuu wa tarafa na machifu. Hakuna njia nyingine ya kuleta maendeleo katika pahali po pote isipokuwa kuungan  pamoja na kufanya kazi pamoja. Hii kwa sababu wafanyakazi wa Serikah wana kazi ambayo wamepatiwa kufanya. Vile vile viongozi wote   [The  Assistant  Minister  for  Planning  and National 	Development]kama Mawaziri na wanasiasa wengine wana kazi  ya kufanya. Kwa hivyo, ni neri uwe na umoja sisi sate.Ahsantenn </NEWSPEECH> .	 	<NEWSPEECH> An hon. Member: Muda wako ulimalizilka zamani. 	Mr. Deputy Speaker: Order! Will the hcon. Members  observe the red light?</NEWSPEECH> <NEWSPEECH> The Assistant Minister for Education, Science and Technology (Mr.  M’Maitsi):  Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this chance to contribute to this Motion on Adjournment. We have been looking forward to this day. We hope that everybody will go home and give assistance to the people in the countryside, especially in completing the classrooms in order to make the 8-4-4 programme a success We should also try to build classrooms for the Form I students.First of all, I would like to pass to the hon. Members greetings from the people of Zaire where I have just come from. I am sure that we all know that we are living in a privileged country and we should be proud of that.  Wherever we go, we find that our country is very famous, because of our leaders courage and tolerance, and for what he has tried to do for this country. Everybody should realize that what we say here is very important. When such things are reported in the newspapers, people start to  analyze those things, so that they can know what their leaders are trying to do. It is a very bad image to our people, when we start to throw dirty words at each other here in this House, just simply because we know that we got immunity. We know that we have Power and Privileges Act which safeguards that immunity. However, we should dry to make sure that whatever we say, here does not go out of hand because we say that on behalf of all the people in the country. So, we should try to ensure that whatever we say here, is in conformity with what we have chosen to defend. We should try to defend our privileges rightly. But we cannot say that we are defending our privileges, when we start to attack each other. It is not fair for us to start throwing bad words at each other and then say, "We are doing so because we are privileged". That would not work. I think we must be responsible for whatever we say here. We have seen some of us throwing some bad words at their colleagues in a joking manner.  But such things hurt some people very much. This practice should stop forthwith. In the next Parliament we should be more grown-up. We should always confine ourselves to whatever we are discussing in this House instead of going outside to attack each other.</NEWSPEECH> <NEWSPEECH>Mr. Deputy Speaker: Order! I just want to make a small correction. When we come back we will still be in this Parliament, but not in the "next Parliament" as you have just claimed.</NEWSPEECH> <NEWSPEECH> The Assistant Minister for Education, Science and Technology (Mr. M’Maitsi]: When we come after the Recess, we must try to change our way of addressing each other. We should try to forget the abusive words, that we throw at each other in a joking manner. Such words are very damaging to other people. I am sure that some of us will try to change that habit. We should all of us try to be tolerant. We can only try to be tolerant to a certain stage. But we can reach a stage where we cannot tolerate some things. When we reach that stage we shall not entertain certain things. When tolerance runs out the results are very bad.Our newspapers should try their best to project their attention to development projects all over the country. But today they try to look for sensational news and f i tina so that they can put those news on the headlines. But when it comes to development projects, they do not mention anything. We hope that they are now going to highlight development projects.On rural development we request the Government to give more funds. So that mere development can be achieved in various districts. We are saying we need much more, but we are still	handicapped in some Ministries. We do not see how money will come from the headquarters. So, those who are in charge should release this money immediately.I am happy to say that in my own constituency, rural electrification  leas taken off the round,  and  soon  I will request the Kenya Power and Lighting Company to provide electricity to everybody. This is a necessity and not a luxury because we want to see light everywhere.Thank you, Sir.</NEWSPEECH> <NEWSPEECH> Mr. Mutiso: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me also join my other colleagues who have spoken before me in support of this Motion to adjourn this House sine die.First of all let me take this opportunity to thank His Excellency the President for his tireless efforts in search 	of peace for our neighbours, the people of Uganda. We have seen that this  goes into people’s nerves when, at the ;negotiating while, people throw words across each other, and our President has been very tolerant to realty try to bring these brothers together so that peace in Uganda is also our peace in Kenya. Because of that, I would like to thank him and congratulate our Presidenton the stand he has taken and his tireless efforts to look 	for peace for our neighbours. Therefore, because of that, he  deserves  a lot of congratulations and support so hat this country c. an also live in peace. We would also like to see our East African Federation which, in fact, he echoed the other day, that he looks forward to a day when there shall be the East African Federation as  was  forecast  before  independence.  It cannot be achieved when one neighbour is actually out in the cold.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, having said that, let me touch on another very important point and this concerns the business of this House and the way it is reported by the newspapers here and the Voice of Kenya. We have seen that some hon. Members are noteven reported the way they should be and I do not know why.  I understand that some people get preference maybe  because  they  have cultivated  some  personal friendship with some ;newspapers and ,things like that. 	But we feel that the newspapers representatives in this House should take the business of this House equally and report the way the deliberations have gone on.  Furthermore, there has been same trends to try to give more oredit to the Front Bench. For instance, when you listen ito "Today in Parliament" over the radio when replies, to questions are baling given, you only hear what the Minister told the House,  and you keep on waiting to hear who brought that tpattioubr point. At the end is when you hear a certain hon. Member is mentioned as elie one who brought that particular question. The same thing Iis repeated over the Voice of Kenya. I think this is an upside-down way of doing things. Questions should come firat so that the listeners can know who actually brought that question and how it was replied. So, the reply should come after the question, but not the reply before the question.This is an upside-down way of doing things. I think it is aimed art giving credit to the Front Bench should not be the case.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. the other thing I would like to say is about our national party, Kanu. Here I am giving very advisable points to the party .officiPile. The tendency which is there of giving the civil servants and particularly the Administration officials the freedom to chair and supervise party  elections, I think we are driving towards the wrong end. The national officials should chair the party elections but not ha Administration officials. Although we are one and the same people, but these people have a different rode. They vine not politicians. So, we want politicians to play their role properly so that whenever anything goes wrong we know whom to handle. But when we jump on a P.C., D.C. Or D.O., then we are told that we are not co-operating with  Civil servants. Let politics be to the politicians  and let all the businesses connected with ,politics be handled by politicians.Finally, I would like to  request the Govennment to take more serious steps in the settlement sohernes in Yalta whach have taken very long to be accomplished. I would like to see in 1986 that all settlement schemes are finalized in, that area.Thank you, Sir.</NEWSPEECH> <NEWSPEECH>Mr. Chepkok: Ahsante sana, Bw.

Naibu Spika, hakuna haja   kuchukua   mambo   yaliyozunguinziwa  katika Bunge na kuyazungumzia kule nje Hilo ni jambo la maana?Kuhusu  Mawaziri, ningetaka  kusema kwamba ma-swali ya Bunge hayajibiwi 	ikamilifu.Kwa hayo machache, ninaomba latunga unkono.The Assistant Minister for Lands and Settlement (Mr. Muturia): Ahsante sana, Bw. Naibu Spika. Mimi nina-simama kuunga mkono Hoja hii arnbayo irnewaSilishwa na Kiongozi wa Shnghuli za Serikal, na mwenye ujuzi, Mtukufu MakamuRais.Bw.  Naibu  Spika,  kwa  vile 	ia dakika  chache, ningetaka kutaja kitu kimoja. Ningetaka kumshukuru Mtukufu Rais wa vile ni yeye peke yake, anayefanya bidii kuzitembelea sehemu zote za Jamhuri ya Kenya. Ningetaka  Mawaziri  wengine  na  Wabunge  wafuatemfano wake kwa kuteutbelea Jamhuri yetu 	tuweze kujua  matatizo  yaliyoko katika  sehemu mbalimbal. Ingefaa tusaidiane  kunmaliza  ukabila,  kulingana  na uongozi wa Mtukufu Rais, nchini Kenya ili watu wote wajione kama ndugu. Bw. Naibu Spika, jambo lingine ni kwamba kuna nyimbo ambazo zimetungwa na walimu pamoja na watoto wa Jamhuri ya Kenya. Nyimbo hizi zina ma funzo ya maana na humshukuru Mtukufu Rais. Nyi¬mbo hizi zina maelezo mengi ya utaalamu. Ningepe ndekeza kwamba nyimbo hizi tamu na zenye maelezo mazuri ziwekwe katika kipindi kila wiki na kutolewa kwa Sauti ya Kenya (VoK). Ninasema hivyo kwa sababu watu wanapenda nyimbo hizi zinazomshukuru Mtukufu Rais. Nyimbo hizi zina maelezo mengi na malamu ambayo yangefaa kuigwa na watu wote katika Jamhuri. Kwa hivyo, tungependa ziwekwe katika ki¬pindi fulani katika Sauti ya Kenya.Bw. Naibu Spika, ningependa pia kutaja huduma zinazotolewa katika Majengo ya Bungeyaani. Parlia¬ment Buildings. Siyo mimi peke vangu ninayeona jambo hili bali ni Wabunge wote. Vile unavyojua, Bw. Naibu Spika, Wabunge wanatakiwa kutumia huduma ya simu katika Majengo ya Bunge wakati wanapdfanva kazi yao. Ingawa wanastahili kutumia huduma hii, simu za Bunge ni mbovu. Huwezi kupiga simu moja kwa moja. Sijui ni kitu gani kimesababisha laini za simu kaitika Bunge; hili zisifanye kazi. PFuwa ni lazima Wahe shimiwa Wabunge waondoke nje kwenda kufanya kazi. Huduma ya simu si nzuri.Pia, ningetaka ikutaja mambo machache juu ya vyombo kama saa katika Majengo ya Bunge. Kuna saa moja tuna mi hii iliyoko hapa Bungenikatika Ma¬jengo ya Bunge imayofanya kazi. Unaweza kuona zile .saa nvingine zikionyesha saa Tano walcati ambapo ni saa Nane za mchana. Saa nvingine huonyesha saa Tatu na hali huwa ni saa Mbili. Tungetaka saa hizi ziondolewe, au zitengenezwe ili zilingane na ile saa ya Sauti ya Kenya. Ni aibu kuwa na saa kama hizi katika Majengo ya Bunge. Mgeni au watoto wa shule wanapotembezwa hapa, hushangaa kuona kwamba saa inaonyesha kuwa ni saa Tano, na hali huwa ni saa Tisa. Tungetaka saa hizo zirekebishwe.Ningetaka kuwajufaha Waheshimiwa Wabunge kwa¬mba hivi sasa mvua inanyesha katika sehernu rnbali mbali nchini, na ningetaka tuchukue nafasi hii kwa kupanda miti. Kuna miche mingi ya miti nchini na pia kuna mvua ya kutosha. Kwa hivvo. tunande miti minrn vile iwezekanavyo.Jambo langu la mwisho ni juu ya Wizara ya Elimu, Sayansi na U fundi. Nikiwa mwenyekiti wa Garbatula High School, ningetaika kuiomba Wizara ichunguze hali ya watoto ambao hawakufanya mtihani wa C.R.E. (Christian Religious Education). Ningeomba watoto wa Garbatula wasiwe victims.Kwa hayo machache, Bw. Naibu Spika. naomba mkono.</Newspeech><NEWSPEECH>Mrs. Ogot: Thank you Mr. Deputy Speaker for giving me the opportunity to speak for five minutes on this Motion of Adjournment.First of all, Sir, I would like to thank His Excellency the President, who finds dime, during his busy schedule to turn his attention to the "jua kali" people who need a lot of help financially or otherwise. I hope that His Excellency’s fine hands will extend to other towns like Mombasa, Nakuru, Kisumu and even Yala.Sir, while 1985 is coming to a close, I will not forget to thank the women of Kenya, who brought great honour to this country when they hosted the United Decade for Women and Forum 85 in Kenya. My special thanks go to Her Excellency M.ss Margaret Kenyatta who presided over this mammoth conference. I would also like to do the same to Her Excellency Mrs. Pamela Mboya, who was the director and who managed to organize the conference through the Secretariat and the Ministry of Culture and Social Services.Sir, I would also like to thank Dr. Eddah Gachukia for chairing Forum 85 and the rural women who participated fully in this conference. I hope that as a result of this great conference that took place in Kenya, the impact will remain a permanent feature on the rural woman. I also hope that the financial assistance that will accrue from that conference wM bring relief to the rural woman and uplift the quality of life for members of her family.Sir, turning to the Ministry of Health, I would like to thank the Minister and staff of the Ministry for visiting Yala Division during last month. I am thankful to the Minister for upgrading Akala Dispensary to a health centre, a fact which the district development committee has already accepted. The people of Yala Division are looking forward to having a health centre at Akala.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, while thanking the Minis¬try of Water Development for having given us a lot of assistance and they have now embarked on Phase II of the water project in Yala Division. I would very much ask them to have mercy on one of our important schools Sawagongo High School which has gone without water for three months. Before the term ended we were having our water being drawn from the river. We had a lot of problems with funds as well as with the motor which helps us to pump the water. We are therefore asking the Ministry kindly to allow the school which is only one kilometre away from Nyawara Town to be connected with the main water pipe at Nyawara Town. Since the community had agreed to help in raising funds we are asking the Ministry kindly to boost our efforts in order for the school to have water when the new term begins in January, 1986.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would also like to ask the Ministry of Energy and Regional Development to kindly encourage the Kenya Power and Lighting Com¬pany to speed up their Rural Electrification Programme. I have in mind a very important technical school like Ndere Polytechnic which is doing a lot of work to help with preparing things for housing in rural areas and also preparing household utensils like pans, buckets as well as spades being used in the house. But their work has been hampered by lack of electricity and as I talk here now they have not been able to do any welding because of the lack of electricity.Finally, I am asking the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development to send its extension officers to help us as we embark on planting coffee in 1986.The extension workers should go out now and help the rural communities in preparing the land; to start cultivating and planting coffee in 1986.With those few remarks, I beg to support. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>The Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Livestock Development (Mr. Mwicigi): Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I would like to join my colleagues in supporting the Motion because, as the Speaker had told us earlier, this is the longest period we have served and we need time to go out and visit our constituencies to see what is going on there and to meet the people who brought us into this Parliament.Also with regard to Ministries we should also have time to look at the Motions. Which have been passed here and see what we can implement and also look more closely at any promise we have made in this House and ensure that it is properly fulfilled. We are going to do that in various Ministries and I would also like to mention to our colleagues in the Ministry of Transport and Communications that they need to re-examine the position of the road toll, on the Nairobi/Thika Road. First of all this road toll is hurting one part of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development and this is the National Research Station. This is because the offices and the residential area are separated by the toll station. So, what happens is that an officer waking up very early in the morning to go to the office is going to pay the toll and before lunch he has also to pay to go home for lunch; coming from lunch he is going to make another payment and when leaving the office after working hours he is also going to make another pay¬ment. That is making our work very difficult and we feel that the Ministry may consider relocating that road toll station elsewhere. They changed the location of the other toll station between Nairobi and Machakos. Also the position of the toll station I have mentioned has split the town of Thika into two parts. You find that some residents are on one side and others are on the other side. Perhaps it is about time that serious con-sideration was given to that road toll station. I think the Ministry is giving that request serious consideration and this is also the view of the people in the area. Also the Ministry of Transport and Communications will also have plenty of time to look into that famous road called Gaichanijru which has been in need of tarmac for a very long time. The people in that area need that tarmac road; there are all sorts of reasons to support this.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, T know that there are many people who want to speak and therefore I will not take long. But I think we should consider this issue of tribalism very seriously. Let us remove tribalism from' our hearts and not from our tips. Let us remove it comple¬tely because it can make a country commit suicide. We can put people into compartments of tribalism and one tribe having conflict with another tribe and this will have no end. So, as we go on Recess we should go very deeply to see the evils of tribalism and consider how something else can be done. Tribalism is a problem and the country that stands firm manages to wipe out tribalism. We have seen very serious problems caused by 'tribalism in our neighbouring countries. These pro¬blems are very serious and must be eradicated.With these few remarks, I support the Motion. </NEWSPEECH><NEWSPEECH>Mr. Hassan: Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me an opportunity to contribute to this Motion for the Adjournment of the House sine die.Having sat continuously for the last two months, I think, it is good for us to go on Recess to 'be able to refresh our minds. This will also enable us to go to our constituencies and meet our people.Having said that, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have one or two things to point out. As we go on Recess and as we travel to our respective constituencies in the rural areas we will meet civil servants in our areas. These civil servants are the ones who are instrumental in the success of the jobs done by the Civil Service. But these people, in my opinion, are bit under-privileged. I am now talking about the junior officers and middle-class officers in the Civil Service. Recently we discussed and adopted the report of the civil Service Salaries Review Committee. According to that report some senior posi¬tions in the Civil Service and the Judiciary were up¬graded. But what I am saying is that clerical officers and also clinical officers in the Ministry of Health and many diploma holders from our institutions of higher learn¬ing like Egerton College. Medical Training Centre and others should be also up-graded. I would therefore like to take this opportunity to urge the Public Service Commission, which is the body in charge of promotions and up-grading of civil servants and so on to lock into this matter. You will find that some of these diploma holders from Egerton College and other institutions of higher learning leave college with the same qualifications as those who 'have been to the university. Bui what happens these days is that those from the universities take over jobs when these citizens of Kenya and civil servants have merited, by all aspects, to be appointed to such positions. This is happening mostly in the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development, and Ministry of Water Development. Some of these officers hold certificates and diplomas from the Water Training School and from Egerton College. But they do not get immediate promotions after doing a good job for the Government and their chances of them being given further training are very remote.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, you will find that somebody who is a diploma holder from Egerton or from another college will have gone through Form VI and gets the opportunity to go to the university. When this person finishes his studies at the university, he will still be a young person and when he 'is employed, sometimes he may take over from another diploma holder who may have held that post for four or five years. You will find that some of these fellows are always discouraged in their work. Equally so, are the clinical officers. You will find that all other sections of the Ministry of 'Health, are well taken care of because officers in the different cadres get enough training and promotion, but these clinical Officers even after completing their course at the Medical Training Centre and get diplomas, they rarely get promotions. So, I would like to appeal to those concerned to consider these clinical officers be¬cause these are the fellows who do a lot of work.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other point which I would like to make is about the constitution of the district development committees vis-a-vis the Ministries headquarters. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, when we ask Parliamentary questions here, we are referred to the district development committees, but what is happening is that the Ministries headquarters are awarding con-tracts to some of the projects at the district level or rather in the rural areas. When we ask questions here regarding these matters, the answers given are not satis¬factory. For example, one case in point is about the construction of some health centres which were proposed to be built in Garissa District that is Mbalambala Health Centre, Holugo Health Centre and Dakar Health Centre. These three health centres were proposed in the district development committee and were supposed to be undertaken by the Ministry, but even if the funds were not there	Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, with those few remarks, I beg to support.Mr. Kisuya: Ahsanite sana. Bw. Naibu Spika kwa kunipatia nafasi hii ill nami niseme machache juu ya Hoja hii ya kuahirisha Bunge. Ningetaka kwanza kuwa omba Mawaziri wakati huu kwamba wanapokwenda nyuiinibaini. waihaikiilkkhe ikwomba .wa.nutairobdea wifeya mtrailimbpili fcatfe Knya rozima. Tifoiiw® wewe pia .mi Wswiri Msaidizii, irrgefaa utaroie mtuasi lnii kuitamfcelea nchi hi vote ii !k.Ui;omria kacai ya .mrnaidii lrofcailiarobali. Pengine kuna Waziri ambave amekuwa hapa kwa miaka mitano bila kuitembelea sehemu vo vote, na ningetu maini kwamba wakati huu, Waziri kama huvo angefika kule Bungoma, Mombasa au Garissa 111 kujionea ni mambo gani ambayo vanaendelea kule. Ni haia gani kuwa na Waziri ambave hataki kuitembelea nchi ill kujionea maendeleo ambayo yanafanyika katika nchi yaico? Kwa hivyo, ningewaorroba Mawaziri wakati wa Likizo hii wahakikishe kwamba wanatembelea sehemu •mbalimbali za nchi hii yetu. Ikiwa wata.panga kuitembe¬lea sehemu ya Bungoma ya Kati, ningetaka wanifaha mishe ili niwezi kmvakaribisha vizuri na nitafoakikteha kwamba wanatembea sawasawa ili wajionee ni mambo gani yanayoendelea kule. Nasema hivyo kwa sababu ninajua kwamba Mawaziri wengine hawajafika kule Garissa au kule Bungoma. Kwa hivyo, ombi langu ni kwamba tungetaka Mawaziri hawa watutembelee katika wilayani zetu.Bw. Naibu Spika. katika nchi hii tuna mikono mitatu muhimu ya Serikali. Kwanza .tunayo Executive, Judici¬ary nia ParMnmant ihi.i laimbawo >ndivo imtunga sher.ia. Ni lazima kila mtu apewe nafasi yake ya kufanya kazi. Ikiwa wewe ni mfanvakazi wa Serikali, una haki ya kufanya kazi yako bila kuingiliwa. Ikiwa wewe ni Mbu nge ambaye kazi yake ni kutunga sheria. basi una haki ya kufanya kazi yako sawasawa ili usaidie nchi hii ya Kenya. Ikiwa wewe ni mwalimu, wewe ni lazima ufuate kazi hiyo ya uwaldmu sawasawa; ikiwa wewe ni ofisa yakilimo, fanya kazi yako vizuri; ikiwa wewe ni datotaii, fanya kazi yako sawasawa na usiingilie kazi ya mtu mwingine. Sisi kama viongozi wa Kanu, tulihudhuria mkutano muhimu sana kule K.I.A. na tulizungumza juu ya uhusiano baina ya wana Kanu na wafle ambao wame chaguliwa katika Bunge hili na tulipitisha kwamba oi lazima tuwe na umoja na kushirikiana vizuri ili kuinua uchumi wa nchi hii. Najua kwamba kila mtu anaipenda kazi yake na kwa hivyo, tusiingilie kazd ya mtu ye yate. Kwa hivyo, ikiwa wewe ni mfanyabiashara, endelea na kazi yako bila kuingilia mambo ya fitina.Kiwa saibaibu t.umeyaziiiniguimzia maimfco imeingi sana, naona kwamba jambo ambaio tungesema sasa juu ya Executive na Judiciary ni kuwauliza watu wa Butere ffi, ikiwezekana, wamwache huyu Mhe. Shikuku aishi salama salimini na kungoja mwaka wa 1988. Mhe. Shikuku amechaguli.wa kuja hapa kwa muda wa miaka mitano tu na muda huo ulco karibu kwisha. Mwaka wa 1988 hauko mbali sana, bali uko karibu sana. Kwa hivyo, tunawauliza watu wa Butere, kupitia kwa Bunge hili, wamhurumie Mhe. Shikuku ili aishi salama na kuifanya kazi sawasawa. Jambo hili tunalolisema katika Bunge hili linafaa loitimizwa, na watu wa Butere wam ngoje Mhe. Shikuku mwaka huo ndio, wafciona kwamba inafaa wamrudishe hapa, waimradishe, au wakiooa kwamba inafaa aondoke, basi aondoke.Tufeiangaiia uparode wa justice, tunaona kwamba kuna watu wengi wanaoitomia nafasi hii vibaya na kuyachukua mashamba ya watu wengine kwa njia ya kula hongo.. Waitu wengi wanaiUimia nafasi hii kuwa nvanaanva maskini mali vao. Kwa hivyo, kwa sababu tunakwenda Likizo ya Krismasi, naona ikwamba inge faa tuwe tukitembea na kuwaona maskini na matajiri walivyo. Ingefaa tuwe na roho njema ya kuinua uchumi wa nchi hii.Ukiniruhusu, Bw. Naibu Spika, nitanukulu mstari mmoja hapa kwa wale ambao wako hapa sasa. Mstari huu unasema:"You are doomed for your solution. You makeuniust laws that oppress my people. That is how youprevent the poor from having their rights and from geStting justice. Thalt .is how you taike the .property ttat belongs to iPhe widows arid Oinptans."Hapa, inasemekana kwamba sisi, tulio hapa, tunafaa kuona kwamba .tunatumia haki. Haki hii ndiyo dnayo takikann kabisa kwa sababu huu ndio ukweli.K.wa temiailiaa, nm^ependia. ikusarria fctwaimiba iragefaa Wizara ya EMrriu. Saryiansi na Ufiuinidi	Kwa hayo machache, Bw.

Mbunge aliyemaliza kuzungumza sasa faivi ange twambia ni mstari gani aliokuwa akiunukulu.Ningependa kuunga mkono kuahirishwa kwa Bunge hili ili twende Likiizani. ICabla sijaisema mameno mengi, kwa ikowa muda tulioiniaio sasa wa fcuzunigomza ni kidogo. ningependa kuungana na wenzangu na kutoa shukrani kubwa sana kwa Mwenyezi Mungu kwa kutupa mvua mwaka huu ambapo mavuno yetu yame patikana kwa njia nzuri sana.Baada ya kusema hivyo, ningependa kuichukua nafasi hii na kumshukuru Mtukufu Rais kwa kuiendesha nchi hii ili ifikie ufanisi zaidi kuzidi hapo mbeleni. Alianza uongozi wake vizuri na anatuendesha vizuri. Kama Waheshimiwa Wafounge walionitangulia kuzungumza walivyosema, zawadi ya pekee tunayoweza kumpn Mtukufu Rais ni kumwombea kwa Mwenyezi Mungu tu ndiye anayeweza kumpa nguvu zd kutuendesha mpaka tuufikie ufanisi zaidi. Pili, lunafaa kutii mashauri anayotupa ndipo haita yeye aweze kufurahi kama ilivyo semwa hapo awali.Pia, ningependa kuichukua nafasi hii lcumshukuru Bw. Spika mwenyewe, wewe kama Naibu Spika, na wale Waheshimiwa W,abunge wanaoshikilia nafasi ya Bw. Spika wakati yeye nawe ha.mko hapa. Nyote mme tuendesha vizuri sana na ninatumaini kwamba Mungu aitawalinda nyote mpaka tuitakaporudi hapa mwaka mpya.Vile vile, ningependa ikuwashukuru Waheshimiwa Wab.unge wenzangu ambao wameonyesha kuwa wame kuwa mature ikabisa, hasa jhizi; si:ku za ikumalizia mwaka huu. Ninawashukuru na kuwatakia heri wote wakiwa nyumbani.Kundi lingine ambalo ningependa kuichukua nafasi hii niwashukuru ni wakulima wa Kenya ambao wame fanya kazi ya maafia sana. Bila ya wao kuifanya kazi hiyo kufuatana na mashauri ya Mtukufu Rais kwamba wanafaa kulima kila aina ya chakula, tusingefaulu upande huu. Kweli, wakulitna wameuitikia mwito !huu na sasa hat una taabu y.a njaa. Tunatoa shufcranii nyingi sana kwa wakulima wetu na tunawaomba watayarishe mashamba yao mapema ili mambo kama hayo yapate kuendelea.Litaikuwa kosa kubwa sana ikwangu ikusimama hapa na kuongea bila fcutoa shukrani nyingi zaidi kwa Serikali yetu tukufu kwa maendeleo ambayo wamewahi kuteke leza katika mawakilisho yangu ya Baringo Kaskazini. Serikali imechimba xnaji katika sehemu moja kule Kerio Vailley katika eneo moja linaloitwa Kapluk, na ninge¬penda kutoa shukrani zangu kwa Wizara ya Ustawu wa Maji. Kwa wakati huu kiwatidn cha kuchambua pamba kilichoko Saiawa kimepata maji. Pia, Wizara hiyo ina endelea kutfanya kazi katika sehemu moja inayoitwa Geturwa na nyingine inayoitwa Burweza. na ninatoa shukrani sana.Bw. Naibu Spika, katika Biblia hiyo hiyo Mhe. Kisuya alikuwa akisoma. Mungu anatwambia tumpe ahsante kwa yale ambayo amelufanyia ili yale ambayo yeye bado kutufanyia yatambulikane kwake. Pia, ninge¬penda kusema kwamba yafaa kwetu kutoa shukrani kwa Mtukufu Rais na Serikali kwa yale ambayo tume weza kufanyiwa. Ningependa pia kuishukuru Wizara ya Afya kwa kutujengea kituo cha afya cha Kabartonjo ainbacho ni cha kisasa. Kwa niaba ya watu wa mawaki¬lisho yangu, natoa shukrani nyingi sana. Pia, Wizara yaUchukuzi na Mawasiliano Ametufanyia kazi kwa sababu hivi sasa ninaweza kutoka hapa Bungs hadi Kabartonjo kwa barabara ya lami, na ninatoa shukrani zangu kwa sababu tulikuwa tumengoja kwa muda mrefu sana touwekwa hiyo lami. Ninayo matumaini kwamba (bara¬bara hiyo itaendelea kuwekwa lami hadi mahali panapo itwa Kipsarania na mbele, ingawa ninajua inategemea pesa zinazopatikana na Serikali. Ingawa hivyo, natoa shukrani zangu kwa kazi ambayo imefanyika hadi sasa.Kuna mwito ambao umetolewa na iMtukufu Rais akiwa Rais wa chama knachotawala kwamba kila lokesheni ni lazima iwe na nursery ya miti, na ninatoa shukrani zangu kwake. Maofisa wa Wizara ya Mazingira na Mali Asili watashirikiana na viongozi wa chama kinachotawala ili waweze ikuwapatlia mawaidha juu ya upandaji wa miti, hasa miti ya kiasiJi. Wenyekiti wa chama katika loikesheni au katiika lokesiheni ndogo yo yote wakitaika mawaidha ikutoka kwa Wizara waiaweza kuyapata walkati wo wote kwa sababu maofisa wetu wafco tayari kushirikiana kwa makini ili kuona kwamba mitt imepandwa katika kila loikesheni na lokesheni ndogo na pia kila mawaikilisho na wilaya ili nchi yetu iweze kuwa tia miti ya kutosha.Nikimalizia. ningependa kutoa mwito kwa Sauti ya Kenya redio na televiisheni waone kwamba wameende sha kazi yao kama vile Mhe. Mullso alivyosema ili wahudumiwe watu wote sawasawa.Kwa hayo machache, Bw. Naibu Spika, naunga mkono.Mr. Oyondi: Ahsante sana, Bw.

Kwa vile sasa tunaelekea Likizoni, na ni juzi tu .tulipitishapesa za sntviuimizi ya Senikaiiina tunafailiaanu mipango yoits ya iinaan.d?i]eo iimapsieikwa wilaiyaniron.g&pendakuomba Wizara zinazahusiiika kuibak^ikisha kuiwa mae¬ndeleo hayo yanafanyiika ihuko wilayani, ma tulkiiirudii ihaipa mwaka ujao towe tuimejioinea maendeleo imemigi yaliyoifanyika. Hii ni kwa sabaibu kte ibunaipozungiurnza hapa tonaambiwa kuwa ni wajiibu wa wulaya futoni kuzingatia jambo fulano kabla ya jambo kama hilo kuzingatiwa na Wizara. Kuna mambo fulani ambayo yaimezkigatiwa kaitika wilaiya na ibaaidaye fculetwa kwa Wizara iili fcuitekelezwa, laikini iiimachulkua muda mrefu sana kabla ya fcutekellazwa cho ohoite.Ningependa kui^oimtoa Wizara kuhakikisha kuwa wa¬kati huu mapsnddkezo ycnte y.ajnayotioka wilayarai, na yaimepitoshwa na fcamati za maeiniddeo kwa .kuiwa na uzito mlkuibwa, yanaitdkeleawa, ihasa kama miipango ya ujenzi wa ibarabara na miipango ya nguvu za umeme. Kuna s eh emu fulani ncthini ambazo ziimekumibwa na shiida kutokana na ukosefu wa huduma hizo. Kuna shida nyingi sana kuhusu nguvu za umeme, na hata utaona kuna seih&mu nyingine anrbaiko kumepiitdshiwa waya za rtguvu za umeme na ikuendelea intoete, iiaili sehamu zilizo kalikati zinaachwa bila huduma hiyo ya nguvu za umeme.Bw. Naibu Spika, wananchi wanapoona nguvu za umeme zikipifcishwa itu na kufikishwa sehemu za mbel wanasikia vibaya kwa kuwa wanaachwa gizani. Kwa hivyo wanabaki wakiwa na maswali ni kwa nini nguvu za umeme huwa zikipatikana upande mmoja na kupi tishwa mpaka upande mwingine kupitia kwao na bila wao kuzipata huduma hizo. Mara nyingi huwa kwamba sehemu zilizoachwa katikati ni ndogo sana na tunge¬penda kuoimba Wizara inayohusifca kuchunguza na kuhakikisha zinapata huduma hizo za nguvu za umeme. Hii ni njia moja ya kuleta maendeleo.Pia kuna huduma kama za barabara, kama tulivyo wahi kujadiliana hapa mara nyingi, na ingefaa Wizara inayohusika kuhakikisha kuwa zile ambazo zimepatiwa uzito sana na kamati za maendeleo wilayani, zinatenge nezwa kwa kuwekwa lami. Hizi ni sehemu ndogo ndogo ambazo zinaweza kuwatia wananchi moyo ziki tengenezwa ifaavyo. Ni zaidi ya miaka 20 tangu tuji nyakulie Uhuru na wananchi wamekuwa wakifanya makelele kuhusu huduma hizo hizo. Mambo kama hayo yana umuhimu sana kwa mwananchi na wanazi ngatia sana jinsi mambo yanavyofanyika. Kwa vile hapa tunapitisha matumizi ya pesa hapa, na pesa hizo zinaelekezwa huko wilayani ni vibaya kuona mambo yakianza kukwama huko wilayani. Ningependa kuzi omba Wizara zinazohusika na huduma hizi kufanya mambo hayo haraka iwezekanavyo ili huduma hizi, kama vile kuhusu maji, barabara, umeme, hospitali na kadhalika zipatikane kwa urahisi.Nikitoa mfano wa huko Kikoneni, kuna kituo cha afya ambacho hakupatikani dawa. Wagonjwa huwa wakilia kwa sababu 5a ukosefu huo wa dawa. Kwa sababu hiyo ingefaa Wizara kuzichunguza hospitali zote zilizo katika sehemu za mashambani ili huduma za matibabu ziweze kupatikana. Hakuna haja ya ku ienga kituo cha afya mahali fulani ikiwa kituo kama hicho hakiwezi kuwa kikimsaidia mtu ye yote. Maana ya kusema hivyo ni kwamba kituo cho ohote cha afya kikijengwa, ingefaa kuwe na dawa na wagonjwa wa weze kuhudumiwa kwa kupata matibabu. Lakini, kwa mfano niliotoa wa Kikoneni, hakuna dawa huko na haya ni mambo yanayofaa kuchunguzwa kwa makini na W.izara ya Afya ili watu wapate matibabu.Kuhusu Wizara ya Mazingira na Mali ya Asili, ningependa kuomba kuwe na upandaji wa miti mingi kote nchini na ile miti iliyokuzwa itangu hapo asili isiingiliwe na kuvunjwa vunjwa kwa sababu ya manu faa ya mtu binafsi. Kama ni manufaa ya kibinafsi, basi mtu asikubaliwe kuikata ile miti tuliyopanda na inayozidi kutufaa kila siku.Kwa hayo machache, naunga mkono.Mr. Ekidor: Ahsanite sana, Bw. Naibu Spika. Ninge¬penda kuungana na Wabunge wenzangu waliosema mbele yangu. Nina jambo moja kuhusu Afisi ya Rais, arnbalo ningependa kugusia sasa. Hii ni kuhusu mawa kilisho yangu yanayokabiliana na nchi za Sudan na Ethiopia. Kila mara tuna malalizo ya usalama. Nikitoa mfano, mnamo .Tumapili tarehe 8, kuamkia tarehe 9, yaani Jumatatu, watu walipigwa na majambazi kutoka Ethiopia. Kuna majambazi pia wanaotoka Sudan wa naotushambulia. Watu wanne waliuawa huko Lokoma rinyang na mifugo kuibiwa, lakini askari polisi waliweza kuwarudisha mifugo. Kwa hivyo ningependa kuiomba Afisi ya Rais, hasa wakati huu wa Sikukuu ya Krismasi kufungua vituo kadhaa vya polisi ma hali ambapo watu wanahofia kushambuliwa na majambazi hao.Bw. Naibu Spika sehemu kama Lokomarinyang na Liwan ndiko wananchi wanakoishi na wasiwasi zaidi kutokana na mashambulizi kutoka upande mwingine wa mpaka. iKuna fununu kuwa majambazi hao wala fanya mashambulizi mengine kabla ya Sikukuu ya Krismasi. Kwa hivyo, ningependa kituo cha poiisi kama patrol base kifunguliwe sehemu hiyo ambayo inajuli kana kama Miwani. Nataka jambo hili lifanyike haraka uwezekanavyo.Pia, sehemu hii inajulikana kama "Enemy Triangle" maana yake "No mans land", nataka Serikali ipeleke ofisa tawala katika sehemu hiyo. Hii ni kwa sababu ofisa tawala ambaye hukaa Lokitaung havvezi kufikia sehemu hii yote. Kwa hivyo, huduma ambayo inato lewa na Serikali kwa watu wa sehemu hii haifiki kwa wakati unaofaa. Kwa hivyo, ofisa tawala akipelekwa huko "for close administration" itasaidia hawa watu sana.Bw. Naibu Spika, kwa hayo machache naunga mkono.Mr. Ayah: Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.First of all, may I start with an administrative matter which is the issue of our identity cards? There is a great demand for facilities for issuing identity cards. There are so many young people coming from school and so many young people coming of age who want to be given identity cards, but there are no facilities in the appropriate areas. I am trying to request the Office of the President that we have passed a law in this country requiring every young person of the age of 18 to have an identity card, but we are not providing the facilities for them to have those cards in the appropriate areas. I am urging that the issuing of identity cards is not a privilege; it is a law and, therefore, it should be given the right facility in every division, location, and not the young people to be told that they should go to Kisumu, Kakamega, Mombasa or wherever, and when they go there they just queue up and they do not get these identity cards. In any case, Sir, how long can one stay in Kisumu, from, say, Ugenya, Soulli Nyanza and so on wanting to get an identity card when he has already reached the age of being issued with an identity card? So, I am urging the Office of the President to make facilities for our young people to get identity cards when they become of age and in their nearest places so that they do not have to spend so much money roaming about in town looking for ideality cards.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the second point which I want to raise is the question which I put in this morning and which as expected I did not get a proper reply to and this is the question of roads in Kisumu Town. I notice that the Minister of the Local Government is now here, although he is rather busy talking about Kanu, but I would like to appeal to him to look very seriously into the question of repairing of roads, not only in the Kisumu Municipality but in other municipalities as well. The state of affairs in Kisumu Town at the moment is so bad that it does not look like a town at all. Very often, in fact, every other day I see the Minister for Local Government Driving around in Kisumu, and I am sure that he notices that the roads in Kisumu are so bad. I am surprised that when I ask a question in this House I get the most impossible answers from his assistant Ministers; presumably, he must have seen the answer which was given to this House. I appeal to him to take this matter very seriously because a town like Kisumu must have better roads. If the Local Government can have money through the Ministry of Transport and Communications so that they can have these roads repaired.          Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I want to dwell at length on one issue which has been worrying as throughout this year during this session, and this is the question of leadership. We have a responsibility to this nation and to the president to help to lead this nation. We have a responsibility as hon. Members, and we must help the President to run this country. But we cannot do so if every speech is being made by an hon. Member, an Assistant Minister or by a Minister is nothing but warning. The country is program with warnings. Who are we warning?             Sir, a Minister, an Assistant Minister or a Member of Parliament stands up and says, “Do not mix up development with politics”. Now, for God’s take, what kind of speech is that? That chief, the district commissioner or the provincial commissioner says that and then a Minister stands up and says, “Do not mix up politics with development”. He as a Minister, he as an Assistant Minister, he, as a Member of Parliament makes political statements in a Harambee meeting, but talk everybody else not to speak about it.Mr. Deputy Speaker, we are so scared of ourselves. We are so worried about our position in the society, that we keep cm worrying about other people. I am sure the President requires and needs our support to run this country. Now, we cannot run this country if we keep on arguing with ourselves against ourselves and trying to make sure that other people do not have a chance.Sir, even if you listen to Kanu speeches, you will notice that everybody is warning everybody else. What is wrong with the country? There is nothing wrong in this country. Why is everybody trying to say that everybody else is wrong?  Why are we talking about mixing politics with development? If you do not want to be a politician, why bother about it? Why should you try to be a provincial commissioner when you are a Member of Parliament, or why should you trying to be a Member of Parliament, when you are a district commissioner? The reason winy itf.iis is going on is that everybody is scared, of his responsibility. We are not helping the President to nun the country, because we are busy trying to find enemies in every comer, in every constituency end in every little place.I plead, Mr. Deputy Speaker that, while we are on Recess, let us think of ourselves as leader; Lot us think of what we are going to say in public. Let us not took for what to go and attack against each other. A Minister should talk, at least, about his Ministry. They should talk about what they are going to do for the constituency and for the whole country and not what is not supposed to be said by a district commissioner, another Member of Parliament or another Minister. Let us say what is supposed to be done and not what is supposed not to be done because we have lows to look after that.Mr. Deputy Speaker, I am pleading with my hon. colleagues that let us, at least, try to be friendly to each other. Let us try to lock at our responsibilities seriously, and let us not look for problems under every bed in this country.With those few remarks, Sir, I beg to support.</NEWSPEECH> <NEWSPEECH> The Minister for Environment and Natural Resources (Mr. Nyagah): Thank y.au very much. Mr. Deputy Speaker. I am going to be brief in my contribution.First of all, I would like to congratulate ourselves as a House for a year s work that has reasonably been done. I hope that we will do better work next year than this year. I say this because I acknowledge the supremacy of Parliament as a body capable of leading a country well. This is what we have done since indepen-dence, and I hope we shall go on excelling and bettering our performance. The policy that we have followed of Welfare to the Society and Just Government of Men can still be bettered in the future.Through the district focus, Sir, we will be able to get the will and it his co-operation of the people in our development. We shall be able to define more clearly what each one of us should and ought to be doing for the common good.Sir, we have just finished a session of introspection as Kanu Party at K.I.A. (Kenyan Institute of Administration). A number of things were examined under the darubini by those who attended the seminar. Very in¬teresting discussions took place in the seminar, and very interesting resolutions made, especially on the discipline of the party, on the finances of the party and the role of the party en the civil servants as well as the role of the parity in the general development of the country. We came out with the conclusion that each one of us in this country is he a civil servant or not, a Kanu leader, a Parliamentarian or a councilor has a part to play.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, as long as we do not meddle with the affairs of each other, this country will develop very fast, it is interesting to hear the hon. Member, who has just finished talking giving us a very wise counsel; that we should avoid the very dangerous word "warning". I do not think we should continue warning each other. Before we warn each other, we should warn ourselves. For instance, I should warn myself. The statements that I make should be statements of fact, and statements that will make this country move forward, but not statements that will scare people.The Press, of late, has been fed by us and not others. They weigh what we say; maybe with a little touch to make the newspapers sell. But if we can avoid being sensitive or sensational, we will run this country better than we are doing it.Now that we are; proceeding on a little holiday and I hope it will be a reasonable holiday we should come back at the beginning of the year fully convinced on what to do about the affairs of this year the ones that have been splashed in the newspapers in this country we should forget things of the past and con¬centrate on making Kenya a better country for all of us.I wish our Government, through the wise leadership of our President, a very merry Christmas and even a greater and prosperous new year. The Government is nobody else, but ourselves in this House; we are the policy makers. We in the Front Bench here do spearhead the policy making in this country. I am sure that the policies we formulate arc good policies. We hand over these policies to the Executive Arm of the Government for implementation. As a result of the spirit which is prevailing here, I see no reason why we should not have a Kenya that will be even a better than the Kenya we have known in the past. Let us have a very good holiday. Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me the Floor.Mr. Munyao: Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, for also giving me time to participate in this Motion for Adjournment. I particularly wish my colleagues a merry Christmas and a happy new year. I also wish you a merry Christmas and happy new year, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, and pray that all of us will meet here next year having relaxed properly.I have only two points to make here. These are the points I was given by my voters over the weekend. I promised to think about these points.First, you will remember that two months ago, the Minister for Agriculture and Livestock Development came into this House, and confirmed that the Cotton Lint and Seed Marketing Board owed farmers in Machakos District Mbooni included Sh. 21 million for cotton collected. The Minister also undertook to make sure that this cotton is going to be paid for in time. Soon after that I led a delegation of hon. Members of Parliament from Machakos, which included hon. Kikuyu, hon. Muia, and several other Members, to go and see the Minister about this matter. We saw the Minister who called the General Manager of Cotton Lint and Seed Marketing Board, to come and talk to us. We also held talks with the Director of Agricul¬ture together with all his senior officers. He assured us that cotton farmers in Machakos District, were going to be paid within a very short time. He also assured us that even the "A" Grade "B" Grade and even the "D" Grade of cotton would be collected from the farmers. Two months have passed since then. Last week when I was touring my constituency, I met a few people and this is the message I was given. Cotton farmers in Machakos are very, very annoyed. I was fold to speak to the Minister, and tell him that if that cotton is not collected by 23rd December, 1985 which will be next Monday, the Minister himself is welcome to Machakos to witness the burning of that cotton. This is because we are going to burn the cotton which is in our stores because we have nowhere to keep more cotton. We have first grade and second grades of cotton, which have not been collected and this is a very serious matter. It is a very serious issue because, although the Ministry gave farmers a lot of planting seed, it has not been possible for farmers to plant mere cotton. This is because they are not encouraged to plant more cotton when, in fact the other cotton is still in their shatnbas, and in their stores or it has not been collected. Whatever has been collected has not been paid for.Therefore, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we request the Ministry to try and do something before 23rd Decem¬ber, 1985 so that the cotton which has already been collected from the farmers is paid for and whatever cotton has not been collected so far, should be collected. If not so, the Minister should come around on 23rd and witness what will happen to the cotton. We would like him to come down there as he promised earlier. The Minister said he would come down and encourage the farmers to grow more cotton.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, my last point is about sand collection in Machakos, we have had good rains in Ma¬chakos and all our rivers now have got water in them, but you will find sand has been over-collected from the river beds and now the rivers cannot hold any water. Lorries are even travelling at night which makes it very dangerous. Can we have a system of sand collection in Machakos? There was a time when His Excellency the President had given a directive that the large trucks and Lories should not travel at night since there is no urgency in them doing so. However, last night I witnessed five Lorries travelling between Machakos and Nairobi and they were all being driven very carelessly, on their way to collect sand at night. I understand some people were nearly beaten to death when they went down at Ngwani River and insisted on collecting sand from the river. We request the Minister concerned "to be totally strict and make sure that these sand collectors do not come around and if they are allowed to do so, they should not collect the sand at night. This is bad because travelling at night is very dangerous. These people are not paying cess to the local authority concerned and when they are allowed to go and collect the sand, they do not go to the areas where they have been allowed to collect it. Therefore, they are stealing the sand and doing other things at the same time. So, travelling at night should be stopped and these people should be stopped from collecting sand at random. If the Minister would do that, we would be very grateful.Mr. Thuo: Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sin I was indeed waiting for the chance to contribute to this Motion and I thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to do so. I would like to start by joining His Excellency the Vice-President in wishing His Excellency the President a merry Christ¬mas and also a prosperous new year of 1986. I would like to extend my best wishes to the hon. Members of this House by saying may they all have a good Christ¬mas and a happy and prosperous 1986.Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, before I say .anything else, let me touch on Kigumo Water Project. We have this project in Kigumo and I would like to thank our Government through the Minister for. Water Develop¬ment for the way in which this project has progressed. They have done the intake of the water and now they are starting to do the treatment of the water. This is a project. Which can provide about 150,000 to 200,000 people with water and I would like the Ministry concerned to speed up this project. What remains now, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, is the question of awarding the contract for the Phase III of the project which will now take the pipes from the treatment tank to where the people live. So, it would be pointless to have such a nice project for which I thank our Government most greatly, and then fail to take the water to the people. So, I appeal to the Ministry to make sure that contract on the Phase III is awarded so that people can be pro¬vided with water.  What we need are the pipes and our people are prepared to dig the trenches and lay down these pipes with the assistance of engineers and other people concerned. Also the Ministry should provide additional tanks so that the waiter can reach the people without having to burst on the way to the areas intended.Mr. Deputy Speaker, we also have proposed in the constituency new plants which will help the people there to keep animals, such as cattle. One such project is in my area and another in Kangema. The one in my area that will cater for Kigumo and Kandara is situated at Githumu which is a very ideal location for the project. Things there will be done in conjunction with the Kenya Co-operative Crannies, and I appeal to the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development and the other relevant bodies to see that this project is also completed as soon as possible so that we can keep animals because they are what we do not have in my area. This area also grows tea and coffee, but we also need animals there so that we can increase milk and meat production.We have that toll station at Thika. Without many words, this station should .be removed from where it is now. I join hands with my colleague, the Member of Parliament for Kandara, to appeal very strongly that this station be moved to some other place as it is causing a lot of inconvenience to the people who use the road, especially in transporting  their coffee. This toll station is not properly located, and it should be moved away from there. It should be put where it was originally intended to be put, if this is possible.In my constituency, we have very bad roads also. I appeal to the Ministry concerned to look into these roads, especially with regard to their gravelling where tarmac had been put before and has been already washed out. There are some areas which you cannot reach because the .road to the places is very bad.Another point with respect to my constituency is that we have only one tarmac road. Another tarmac road should be provided by the Ministry concerned. This is the road from Gakoigo joining the Kigumo Road. That is a very potential mad which is so hilly that when it is raining, vehicles haves to be put off it for almost the duration of the rains. We have put mur¬rain on it, but this has been washed away. If the Minis¬try could take not of that, it would be very good.Mr. Deputy Speaker, I beg to support.Mr. Deputy Speaker: Archbishop Ondiek, you have three minutes.The Assistant Minister for Co-operative Development (Archbishop Ondiek): Thank you very much, Mr.  Deputy Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to contribute to this Motion for the Adjournment of the House. I must thank His Excellency the President for his work. He has moved around, visiting various places. The kind of public relations His Excellency the President is having in this country is very good.I only appeal that our civil servants try to copy the method that His Excellency the President is trying to create as far as public relations are concerned between the Civil Service and politicians. There are certain areas that cause a lot of confusion where you find somebody like the assistant chief or the chief of an area trying to divert from being a politician or to create a feeling that such-and-such are political statements, and so on. We need good relationships in our country.I would also like to urge the Ministry of Health to try to see that some health centres are built by wana¬nchi through Harambee efforts. These health centres should have the co-operation of the Ministry of Health in seeing that they are supplied with the necessary faci¬lities after wananchi have already made their contribu¬tion and .put up proper centres.There are certain projects that we pass at the district development committee meetings, such as, roads. In Ugenya, there are some roads that we passed at our district development committee meetings to be graveled, but up to now nothing is going on. I would request the Minister for Transport and Communications to try to help district engineers with certain equipment which will enable the officer in charge in Siaya District to see that these roads are improved.During this time when the Ministry of Energy and Regional Development is trying to have rural electrifi¬cation, I would ask the Ministry of Water Development to work alongside the former Ministry in order to have some water projects being managed by wananchi. So rural electrification should go hand in hand with these water projects in order to enable the mwananchi to have an easy way of running those projectsLastly, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I wish all Members of Parliament a happy and merry Christmas.</NEWSPEECH> (Question put and agreed to)ADJOURNMENT<NEWSPEECH> Mr. Deputy Speaker: Hon.
